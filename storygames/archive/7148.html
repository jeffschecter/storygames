Yum!  Separate thread with details, please!<br/><br/>As requested.... <br/><br/>I got the hair to write a retro clone of The Fantasy Trip.  It's more in the style of Four Color (Phil Reed's clone of the original Marvel Superheroes) in that I'm rewriting the whole thing.  <br/><br/>It's <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dcsfz7gv_9gzdh7hdz&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for those who are interested.<br/><br/>Edit:  Design blog is <a href="http://warriorandwizard.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Not much of a blog, just the occasional two-liner about "here's what I finished today, go me!"<br/><br/>Edit:  Changed the thread title from "Wizard and Warrior" to "Warrior and Wizard".

I'm pretty deep inside the material, and I'm having a hard time seeing what you are.  If you happened to note any specific instances, that would help me out a lot.  If not, it's okay; I don't expect you to be my personal editor.

Then you get the first tools of dealing with him - the character classes. Then the gear, then skill points with leveling, and so on. Problem first, then potential tools for dealing with it second. But this game lists tools first and no problem. But as I noted, alot of games are written tools first &amp; no prob - D&amp;D, all versions, is written this way. It might just be me. However, I think there is a certain creative problem - if the end user creates the problem, he has to make one compatable with the rules. So if the end user has in mind a monster of shadow, but there are no shadow damage rules, he has to change what he has in mind to fit those rules. I'm looking at the wider picture, which might not fit the thread, but perhaps an antagonist creation section needs to be there before character creation is? That way, rather than have something in mind, the end user can explore the antagonist creation rules and see what options inspire him. Eh, just ideas, hope I'm not blocking thread up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159258/#Comment_159258" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T21:47:11+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  9:47PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahhh, gotcha.

Further, while you can say it, it would most likely have no legal force -- at least, not in the US.  "Nominative use" of trademarks is specifically allowed in US law.  So what's a nominative use?  It's using a trademark to refer to a product or service.  Nominative use can apply when:<br/><br/>1 - There's no other ready way to identify the product or service in question.<br/><br/>2 - Only as much of the trademark is used as is necessary to identify the product or service.<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>3 - Nothing is done to suggest that the trademark owner sponsors or endorses the use.<br/><br/>Thus, aftermarket auto parts suppliers can say that their parts are for a "Chevrolet Camaro" without the permission of GM, even though both "Chevrolet" and "Camaro" are GM trademarks.  They can't, however, use the Chevrolet logo, since that would be using more of the trademark than is necessary (use of "word marks" is preferred over logos, according to precedent), and they're usually careful to put somewhere on their boxes that their products aren't made or endorsed by GM, just to be absolutely clear on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.<br/><br/>There's a great deal of legal precedent in favor of nominative use, so a defense based on it would stand a good chance of succeeding.  Of course, if you did sue someone over it, they'd still have the expense and trouble of a trial to go through, which in itself causes a lot of people to back down.  But from a legal standpoint, if someone has the will to fight it, you'd most likely lose if you tried to force people not to refer to your trademark except under your terms.<br/><br/>And in any case, since you're made W&amp;W be a clone of TFT, why wouldn't people just say their material is compatible with TFT?  You don't own that trademark, so you can't control their use of it....<br/><br/>(BTW, watch that someone doesn't do unto you as you wish to do unto others -- "The Fantasy Trip" is a currently-registered trademark, held by George Dew, who seems to be one of the people behind Dark City Games.  They publish their own line of TFT-compatible stuff, and, since the trademark had lapsed, apparently went and registered it themselves.)<br/><br/>(Edited to change a typo, and to clear up usage of the generic "you" vs. the specific "you".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159883/#Comment_159883" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T12:54:22+00:00" title="July 30, 2008 12:54PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That Dark City Games TFT stuff is neat.

I'm not taking <i>any</i> of the original TFT text (if any original text is in there, it was inadvertent and I'll remove or change it as soon as I become aware).   Per U.S. copyright law: \n<blockquote><cite>According to the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl108.html" rel="nofollow">U.S. Copyright Office</a>:</cite>The idea for a game is not protected by copyright. The same is true of the name or title given to the game and of the method or methods for playing it.<br/><br/>Copyright protects only the particular manner of an author\u2019s expression in literary, artistic, or musical form. Copyright protection does not extend to any idea, system, method, device, or trademark material involved in the development, merchandising, or playing of a game. Once a game has been made public, nothing in the copyright law prevents others from developing another game based on similar principles.</blockquote>\nSo, all of the original TFT text is protected by copyright -- but the concepts themselves aren't.  ZeFRS and Phil Reed's Four Color are based on the same principle.<br/><br/>Edit:  And, it looks like the copyright office has an answer for me as well.  I don't have any more protection over the concepts than anyone else does.  On the other hand, it looks like I can call my game "Compatible with The Fantasy Trip" as long as I do it right.  Thanks, everyone.<br/><br/>Edit 2:  If it matters, I'm not going to do that thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161717/#Comment_161717" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-09T21:06:07+00:00" title="August  9, 2008  9:06PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only thing I'm missing now, besides a few skills, is an experience point system.
