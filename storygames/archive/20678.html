You can download the game rules for free from from the bottom of the Downloads page of <a href="http://legendaryquest.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://legendaryquest.com</a>. So, you can see if it's something you'd like to try out. To play, the game requires a game board and cards, which can be purchased from <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/macguffin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/macguffin</a>. <br/><br/>I believe I can confidently say that MacGuffin takes a new approach to storytelling games. The game is designed for the players to cooperatively tell a complete story from beginning to end, with character development, theme, and plot within a single 2-4 hour game session.  It's not for everyone. It's a love-it-or-hate-it kind of game. If you have difficulty making stuff up off the top of your head, the game is probably not for you. If you do like improvisational storytelling, MacGuffin provides a rich framework to inspire your creativity.<br/><br/>MacGuffin takes advantage of the fact that all stories are comprised of only a small number of plots (Boy Meets Girl, Revenge, Temptation, Love Triangle, Ultimatum, etc.). As such, the game contains a Meta-Plot Booklet that contains very general questions that are read aloud to the Hounds (the Players) by the Quidnunc (the Game Master) based on the chosen plots and sub-plots. The players then improvise answers to the questions taking ques from the assortment of cards laid out on the game board.<br/><br/>Each card represents a story element (character, setting, or trope) and has a set of traits (words or short phrases). The idea is for the speaker to answer the questions posed by the Quidnunc while describing the story elements of the story. The speaker is encouraged to incorporate the ideas expressed by the traits on the cards, but without actually stating them directly. Instead, he is trying to get any other player to recognize that he is describing a particular trait. Once a trait is recognized, both the describing and recognizing players are rewarded with Fan Mail, the only resource in the game. Fan Mail can be used for a number of things, but the most important is in bidding on how each plot and sub-plot is going to end.<br/><br/>I've put a ton of research and play-testing into MacGuffin. If nothing else, it can quickly teach a person how character, theme, plot, setting, tropes (and, yes, a MacGuffin) come together to create a story. It takes the individual abstract concepts and puts them all together into a cohesive living whole that the players experience as they improvise.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453955/#Comment_453955" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-19T04:26:14+00:00" title="June 19, 2016  4:26AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds interesting!
