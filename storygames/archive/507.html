<p>Ah, the fine art of the provocative title.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've heard the following (in one form or another) many times:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>The GM participates in the game solely to serve the other players. They get their pleasure out of making other people happy, and selflessly sacrifice their own chance to directly make themselves happy in the name of this goal.  If they want to pursue some agenda of their own, to directly make themselves happy through their own actions, then they have no place being the GM.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>What's funny is that I can't recall <strong>ever</strong> hearing an argument for this position.  It's always stated as self-evident.  The sum of people's argument for it is "But ... dude ... if that weren't the case then you'd have the GM pursuing their own agenda.  You see?"</p>
<p>So, yeah, given what I've heard <em>to date</em>, I think this is utter bunk.  The GM is a player.  A few systems allow that player to pursue goals (often different goals from the other players, but goals nonetheless) and to be rewarded and validated for reaching them.  If other systems do not permit the GM to do this, that's a choice of the systems (or, I think, most often just an unconsidered default born of laziness).</p>
<p>But that's only what I've heard <em>to date</em>.  Like I said, I've never heard an argument proferred for why the selfless GM, acting from an obligation to please the other players, is <em>superior</em>.</p>
<p>I am entirely virgin territory (in this <em>one</em> way ... get yer mind out of the gutter).  If you actually have an argument for this, you'll be the very first person to present it!</p>
<p>Or we can all just get together and mock the people who unquestioningly accept this principle without ever putting their brains in gear to wonder why.  I'm good with that too!</p>

<p>Aw fuck!  That draws a very clear link between those two things.  Of course they're the flip side of each other.</p>
<p>Saying "<strong>This</strong> is the guy who is in charge of considering other people's stories" has the very clear implication of "You're not that guy, so you don't have to."</p>
<p>Cool.  First post, and I'm already chewing on some tangy new thought.  I like the taste of it.</p>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>You gotta know that I agree with you on this one. But I'll try to be a devi's advocate to spark some discussion. <br/><br/>First, as Anders said, if you actually get your fun from making other people happy, then making other people happy is fun for you. I have had moments in RPGs where I've been happy because I had hit everyone else's emotional buttons just right -- not because of any other agenda than that. <br/><br/>Second, if you assume a traditional RPG model where 90% of the power lies in the GM hands, then it is all to easy for a GM with a strong agenda to use that agenda to override the game. If you really are going to have your fun only if the players do X and Y and you aren't selfless, then the players are going to end up doing X and Y with a gun pressed to the back of their heads. <br/><br/>Third, I think it's possible to see the duties of a GM being like the duties of a good host in Victorian sensibilities: you have the pleasure of guests, so you should see to the pleasures of your guests. The feeling of grandness and largess is the reward, as is having your friends in your house. Of course, a good Victorian could also tell you that it is the duty of a guest to see to the pleasure of the host and not abuse their hospitality, which is a part often missed in the equation you gave. <br/><br/>Fourth.... I can't think of a fourth.                        </div>

                            Brand is basically right on the money...why shouldn't one gain happiness from making others happy?<br/>
<br/>
Typically, though, I don't see it formulated in the way you do. I see the GM's responsibility being greater not because they are there to make others happy, but on a much more basic level - they have greater input into the "story" (whatever that is) and thus has to use that greater power with more care and caution than a player does. <br/>
<br/>
I am in less of agreement with this formulation than I used to be. After all, to some degree, the less input the players have, the more likely they are to smash against their bars and disrupt the zoo for everyone. But there is something there about not being a dick when you're a GM.                        </div>

<p>Okay, first:  I used the word "directly" on purpose.  I totally get that you can make yourself happy by making other people happy.  You can also make yourself happy directly, without recourse to the reactions of other people.  Sacrificing your ability to make yourself <em>directly</em> happy is not incompatible with making yourself happy by pleasing others.</p>
<p>Like, if I play softball I can have a good time because everyone's happy.  I can even <em>throw the game</em> (particularly with kids) in order to make people happy, so that I can in turn be happier.  Nothin' wrong with that.  But doing so sacrifices my ability to enjoy the game directly because of how I play the game.  If I throw the game and the kids get all fussy and decide that even though they won they're still unhappy because I didn't buy them ice-cream then I get nothing.  No pleasure, not the pleasure of a good game, not the pleasure of being with happy kids.</p>
<p>Get the distinction?</p>
<p>This whole thing about quantity of power though ... I'm still confused about that one.</p>
<p>I could write a game where one player had 99% of the story power, and exercised it with ruthless efficiency toward their goal ... and everyone involved still had fun.  In fact, I've run such games.  I ran a game where one player was a foppish noble on a Dragon Hunt, and wanted specific things (comfort, glory, sex, etc.) and the other characters were servants, completely at his beck and call, but nonetheless with their own agendas and means of pursuing them, particularly by <em>manipulating the noble</em> through his defined and objective weaknesses.</p>
<p>Or ... y'know ... you can play My Life with Master, which does the same thing only way better.</p>
<p>Is it really the <em>quantity</em> of power involved that makes things difficult?  Or is it something about the way that power and potential GM-agendas are organized?</p>

                            Hmm, well Mo's articulation of Pull is closely related to the kind of "selfless" play traditionally expected of a good GM.  You're the mid-line player on a volleyball team, whose job it is to set the ball for the front-line players to spike it.  You're a basketball/hockey/soccer player known more for getting assists than for your own scoring.  And, dude, there's a lot of joy to be had in that position.  As someone currently making their living as a Chinese teacher, there is mucho happiness to be gained by helping other people succeed at something.<br/>
<br/>
However, if the assisting player does all the work, then tapping the ball/puck into the net probably isn't going to be all that satisifying for some players.  After all, they didn't really do very much.  On the other hand, they are the ones who look really cool and get all the attention.  Rebecca Borgstrom once said that the purpose of a game system is to help the players regularly feel clever and cool and the same could be said of a traditional GM.  Some players will be happy with tapping the ball into the net and getting all the glory.  Some will want to pick their own shot.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, with assisting players (GMs, Moons in Polaris), some will be happy to not be the person in the limelight, getting all the credit.  However, many GMs need occasional or consistent reinforcement that what they're doing is awesome and appreciated.  Or they need some way of making the game what they want it to be.  Or they need both.  However, you're totally right that all the GM advice I've ever read has said "figure out what the players want and give it to them."  There has been little discussion about how to have fun as a GM and how to make sure you enjoy the game enough to keep running it.  I know I've run some games that other people enjoyed but we're really draining and unsatisfying for me.<br/>
<br/>
I think the unbalanced nature of traditional GM-player distinctions is part of the reason people turn to GM-less play.  I'd quote Emily Care Boss' article on the subject, but I haven't published it yet.                        </div>

                            Maybe we should be thinking about a distinction between power and happiness.  Being in charge of the story is not the same as being happy <i>or</i> as abdicating one's own happiness in favor of the players.  (And, obviously, being the GM is not necessarily being in charge of the story.)<br/><br/>For me, at least, being happy as a GM means abdicating quite a lot of narrative power.  What makes me happy is the back-and-forth play between me and the other participants in the game, where we both come up with great characters and stories that none of us could have created alone.  I don't want to make my players happy!  I want to make them do interesting things, which makes them happy, and they want to be interesting to me right back.<br/><br/>You could call me a self-sacrificing GM because I spend a lot of time thinking about what would be interesting for my players, but I don't think that would be accurate.  Really I have a very strong agenda, and I do an excellent job of carrying it through.  I want to be surprised by the story, to have it be awesome in ways I never would have expected.  It's not the same pleasure as my players have, particularly the most immersively-oriented of them who really identify with their own characters' exploits, but it's a very strong pleasure nonetheless.<br/><br/>My agenda is a meta-agenda, though.  I take a lot of pleasure in a successful story, but not necessarily in success within the story.   I don't (usually) get attached to the success or failure of particular characters.  So I guess you could argue that I am meta-happy rather than directly happy, but my happiness feels pretty damn direct to me.  I think that's what the quote that Tony brought up is about, though - the difference between in-story happiness and meta-story happiness (though I have no idea whether those terms will make sense to anyone but me).<br/><br/>To pick up the volleyball metaphor, for me there's no net and no one's scoring points.  My players and I are playing together to find out how long we can keep the ball in the air, and I find myself really enjoying it when the players set me up for a spike, or when I set them up for one.  I may be the one who laid out the lines of the court, but once the ball gets into play, it's not at all clear what's going to happen.  My job is to try to make it as challenging as possible for the players to hit that ball back to me, without setting them up for inevitable failure, and their job is the same.  I just happen to have more narrative resources at my command to do it - which is good, because there's more of them than there are of me!<br/><br/>It also helps that my group expresses their appreciation of each other and of the various GMs on a regular basis.  I like knowing that they're enjoying it as much as I am, because it sucks to play with someone who's not enthusiastic.  But that may be a different discussion.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            I definitely love when my players enjoy the game and enjoy my part in the effort.  There is no doubt that I take intense pride in a game gone right when I have had a hand in it.<br/>
<br/>
But when GM's go on about how they only GM for the enjoyment of the players, something smells fishy to me.  It is as if they want currency for later.  As if they are waiting for the moment when tehy can jump up and say, "How could you players be so ungrateful, after all I have done for you!"<br/>
<br/>
I fully admit this could be a side-effect of being raised by a Jewish mother.                        </div>

                            I'm having a hard time with this, because I've never run a game where I'd consider that I made any self-sacrifices.  I don't really have an argument as to why I think the idea is bunk other than I've never experienced it. Can someone site some games that state this?<br/>
<br/>
Also, since sports have been sited in this conversation, maybe a way of attacking this idea is trying to understand what umpires or referees get out of the sports they regulate.  They seem to participate in the game solely to serve the other players. So, the analogy should be a valid one from the self-sacrificers point of view.                        </div>

                            I liked Brand's answer, even though he didn't agree with it himself:<br/><br/><code>It's possible to see the duties of a GM being like the duties of a good host in Victorian sensibilities: you have the pleasure of guests, so you should see to the pleasures of your guests. The feeling of grandness and largess is the reward, as is having your friends in your house.</code><br/><br/>...although perhaps without the grandness and largess. As a GM, I do try to put myself aside. If I want a detective story, but the players want horror then, sure, I'll let them drive it towards horror.<br/><br/>In a sense, you're acting a bit like a meeting facilitator acts: not adding anything yourself but taking what everything else gives you, amplifying it and turning it back. <br/><br/>And to answer Tony's question: I wouldn't claim that this was a <i>superior</i> way of GMing, but it's a valid and useful one.<br/><br/>(Oh, yes, and that thing about having the best seat in the house, too).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Actually, to present an example of contrary evidence:<br/>
<br/>
_Over the Edge_ specifically refers to the characters controlled by the GM as "Game Master Characters"(GMC), with the explicit intent of recognizing that the GM is a player too, and that he's there to have fun as much as the players are. <br/>
<br/>
This thread reminds me that it's one of the pieces of divergent game jargon that I want to steal and adopt.  Because I think it's fair to argue that as is, there's no real motivation to reward the GM systematically.  He gets all kinds of rewards, and an even slightly self-aware GM can choose his venue and maximize the rewards that he cares most about.                        </div>

<p>And there you go folks.  That's a really good way of saying part of what I feel about this.</p>

                            Tony, I don't understand the argument, really. You're essentially saying that, if you do things for the players, you don't do things for yourself. <br/>
<br/>
To which the reply is...<br/>
<br/>
1. In a social context, the things I want to do for myself will often coincide with the things the players want me to do.<br/>
<br/>
2. But even if I'm doing things for the players that I wouldn't have done for myself, then I'm not disempowered, because that's what I've chosen to do.<br/>
<br/>
Disempowerment strikes me as a very strange word to use in this context. As an analogy: If my friends all want to go to the cinema, but I want to go to the theatre, am I disempowering myself if I go with them to the cinema? Hardly.<br/>

<p>Good, functional reasons for the GM to be (directly, not indirectly) focused on making the players happy as her game goal.:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GM is like a host at a dinner. I'm inviting my friends over for a meal I cooked or, alternately, a game I wrote up a scenario for, and I want my friends to come by and <em>eat</em> (or make Hard Choices). When they sit back and are satisfied with what I've cooked for them, I'm feeling pretty damn good. For some games, the dinner party model is apt. (Maybe this is a good way to think of trad illusionism / participationism?)</li>
<li>The GM in in the teacher-like role above or like the bass-man in the band metaphor. He basically likes doing this moderation/guiding level activities, and loves to see the people around him really create awesome things with his suggestions.</li>

<p>There is a mode of the dinner party gone <em>wrong</em>, where if the players don't love the food the cook is crushed and upset and there is angst; but if the GM is enjoying the cooking and attempt to some extent, with the goal of cooking tasty dungeons, then it's all good.</p>

<p>DevP:  Yeah, that!  If you're doing things that you enjoy doing then more power to you.  But if you're doing things that you don't enjoy <em>unless</em> other people react in a certain way then yes, absolutely, you are disempowering you.</p>
<p>I do dinner parties.  My first priority is always that if nobody else shows up I'll look at all the delicious food and chortle as I say "Alright!  MORE FOR ME!"</p>
<p>But I know people who (honest to God) will prepare dishes for a dinner party that are things <em>they don't want to eat</em>.  That's disempowerment right there.</p>
<p>And I know <em>plenty</em> of GMs who will run D&amp;D for a group that demands it, even if they hate everything about the process of GMing D&amp;D ... because they want the group to be happy.  That's disempowerment right there.</p>

<p>And also we also have the other case, where I invite people over for dinner but cook stuff that NO ONE likes. Like rolling up sushi (which I love) for people who have clearly told me they don't like fish. That's what happens if a GM in a host-like role is <em>not</em> adequately paying attention to what his players want. The opposite end of dysfunctional dinner parties.</p>

                            Of course the sushi chef, who invites his friends to a sushi party, should not feel compelled to produce non-sushi for the one person who shows up, and then says "oh, but I don't do sushi." Now if that person says, "Gee, I'd love to come, but the thought of eating raw fish is not appealing to me," our sushi chef could either say "well, next week, I'm going to cook French," or "oh, well, I do several sushi items without raw fish," or he could decide it's really worth having this person over, and offers to prepare one simple dish that will satisfy that person.<br/>
<br/>
But then all of that is negotiating, and that isn't disempowering, as long as you don't let yourself be steamrollered.<br/>
<br/>
The key to empowerment is open communication. If I'm free to express my likes and dislikes, then it's easier to negotiate something that works for all.<br/>

<p>Dude, Joshua ... are you <em>trying</em> to make this more difficult than it has to be?  Does your dad disempower himself is he makes peant butter cookies <em>and</em> fudge <em>and</em> also robs a Las Vegas casino during the after-dinner mints?</p>
<p>If your Dad bakes the cookies then he is not (in that action) siezing his power to make food he finds yummy.  Yes?</p>
<p>Does that stop him from, in another action (e.g. the fudge) sieze his power to satisfy his own cravings?  No, he is not.</p>

<p>I must destroy my own metaphor for the sake of all. <em>BANG</em></p>
<p>Joshua's case: If your dad (who likes trap doors and puzzles) is running D&amp;D with your mom and her friends (who like sneaking around and stabbing things), is it okay for the GM to include some trap doors in the dungeon in between combats, even if no one really likes it besides him, assuming that the players don't terribly mind the trap doors?</p>
<p><em>That's</em> an interesting point, whether what's being done here is good GMing or not. Conventional wisdom would say "no", but Tony might say yes.</p>

<p>I'll make it explicit:  I <em>would</em> say yes.  I do say yes.  That's the kind of GMing I would like to (a) do and (b) receive.</p>
