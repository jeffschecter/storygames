The current version was updated after its first playtest at <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow</a> '13 (Part 2) and now includes a GM's booklet that gives a little bit more guidance on running the game for other people.<br/><br/>If you ever want a game with super fast start-up and minimal investment in preparation required, carrying a few of these playbooks around with you will be worth your while. You could even print off a few playbooks and distribute them in places where you want to attract new gamers with a simple, entry level storygame.\ufeff<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1iTjRUomaBXTWVLRXoxYXhtT0k&amp;usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">First Issues</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
