The rules for ending SFR Scenes now are a little bland--since its just simple player consent--and have the potential to take players momentarily out of the game. In the playtests we've run, we have had some players trying to wrap up scenes while others are still trying to push the banter forward, and trying to resolve those moments without breaking character is awkward. I think that this suggestion--or something similar--could potentially work a lot better.<br/><br/>And, yes, the game does tend to get LARPy. I've found that players mostly stay seated for the first couple of SFR Scenes and Secret Ballots with later scenes and The Interrogations becoming more animated (with standing and pacing and moving towards or away from other players) until The Exorcism, in which everyone is standing and moving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370520/#Comment_370520" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T21:05:02+00:00" title="April  1, 2012  9:05PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the sound of passing.<br/><br/>One question - why a secret ballot?

This helps to shield them from guilt and responsibility for their choice. This is supposed to mimic the anonymity and diffuse responsibility present at a Klan rally or in a lynch mob. This lack of forthrightness should add to the level of distrust and paranoia experienced both in and out of character.<br/><br/>Also, it's a reference to sham elections under Jim Crow.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite> Is the ballot supposed to be something done in the fiction, or is it purely a game mechanic?</blockquote>\nThe ballot is conducted in character, within the fiction, at least superficially. This doesn't mean players can't allow out of character concerns to influence their vote, since they only have to justify their choice (in character) in the case of a tie, and then they can always lie (both about who they voted for and why).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>And should the characters have any relationship with each other, which could be good for guilt-by-association.</blockquote>\nDo you mean general relationships, or shared secrets? The former can be introduced during the SFR scenes. The latter would be very difficult, considering the existing mechanics. Either way, I wanted the bond between the characters to be superficial and based upon pretense and outright lies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370552/#Comment_370552" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-02T03:35:22+00:00" title="April  2, 2012  3:35AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to add that the "get up and leave" action is already baked into the rules, when the vampire or passe blanc are accused.

For example, "Al Shelby's grandfather served with Zeke Ford's grandfather in Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry and the families have been close ever since." I think that might be a good idea, as long as these relationships are on the front of the character sheet with other possible lies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370917/#Comment_370917" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T11:38:39+00:00" title="April  3, 2012 11:38AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I think this is a really important question, because the fact that the vampire actually exists could be interpreted as a covert endorsement of the idea that there actually is some basis behind racial fears. Since I think this is a valid concern, I thought I'd copy/paste part of my response into this thread. Perhaps I'll expand on this with a blog entry later.\n<blockquote>The vampire vs. no vampire issue was probably the hardest design decision I had to make.<br/><br/>Basically, the vampire is real so that the players will feel, out of character, that they have the power to prevent the game from ending horrifically. This makes it possible for the players to engage emotionally with the hunt for the vampire, and makes them extra desperate to find him, to protect their consciences. That level of engagement really needs to be there in order for the game to work as an exploration of racial paranoia.<br/><br/>If the vampire isn't there, it's a sad story about monstrous people doing a horrible thing. The players will know how things will turn out, and they will distance themselves from the game. They know who they are playing and what will happen. It's safe and antiseptic, like a historical reenactment. An alternate, less horrible outcome has to be there to give the game stakes, and its the stakes that create the fear and confusion that lets the players actually experience the irrationally of racism.<br/><br/>Also, note that even though the vampire is real, he's still just another white guy. In fact, he's probably an old colonial European. So evil may be real, horrible things and horrible people do exist, but the racial (or ethnic or sexual) other isn't to blame.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370975/#Comment_370975" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T14:27:31+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  2:27PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.
