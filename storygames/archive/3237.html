And it rocked hard both times.  Its a great game, even for me who doesn't like boxing, and the mechanics seem pretty darn cool.<br/><br/>But both sessions ended with total failure or all the boxers (Pain always greater than Hope).  In the second session, I intentionally tried to work hard on my Hope to see if I could get a happy ending.  But no dice (well the game doesn't use any so I figured the pun was appropriate...)<br/><br/>While I love the play, and the experience of the tragedy of the boxers life, it seems to me that one player who spirals down to into massive pain/no hope is essentially unbeatable.  Definitely the seduction of the dark side.<br/><br/>So has anyone played contenders to a happy ending?  for more than one player? and is it as gut wrenching as the downward spiral?<br/><br/>Jeff                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73554/#Comment_73554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T08:14:04+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  8:14AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not unbeatable, but statistically highly unlikely.

But no happy endings yet. Next time, for sure.<br/>I reckon overall it's about a 1:3 ratio of good to bad endings. Ambivalent endings are fairly common too. <br/>However, this is not statistically precise. So people of story-games - post your Contenders data!<br/><br/>Paul's experience highlights an important aspect of the game. There is a domino effect. Once one player has convinced himself things are hopeless he will probably turn antagonist and drag the rest of the Contenders down. Some players will turn antagonistic just for the hell of it!<br/><br/>Here's some more thoughts and house rules from me on the Pain spiral matter.<br/><a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/293" rel="nofollow">www.collective-endeavour.com/node/293</a><br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Joe                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73712/#Comment_73712" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T22:32:02+00:00" title="June  4, 2007 10:32PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I get the chance to play Contenders at Go Play NW, I'll suggest the use of most or all of your house rules, Joe.  They look pretty good to me.  This one in particular:<br/><br/>"The bonus to Damage for Bringing The Pain is equal to half Pain (rounded up)."<br/><br/>addresses a key concerns of mine adding some tension back into the late game boxing matches against (or between) PC boxers that are full up on Pain.<br/><br/>On a <i>very</i> geeky side note, I finally found a Wii console last weekend (with the accompanying Wii Sports game) and spent almost two hours on Sunday "shadow boxing" in front of my TV, with my ipod on with my Contenders session Playlist in continuous rotation.<br/><br/>Yes, I named my Mii "Finian".
