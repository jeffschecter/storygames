If this is the case, then authors are the equivalent of farmers or ranchers.  (Jasper Fforde explores something similar in his Thursday Next novels.)  <br/><br/>Now suppose that someone or something is causing books to change for unknown and likely sinister purposes.  It would be bad enough if a single typo or change crept into an entire edition, but consider the chaos if multiple copies of editions were to develop thier own distinct mutations.  (Thanks to Robin Laws for inspiration - I've long since lost the link.)<br/><br/>I find myself possessed with the idea of exploring this concept in a game.  What I find myself struggling with is the how.  A direct Jasper Fforde take could have adventurers exploring books in a re-skinned 4th Ed., but this is too overt for my tastes.  Another option would be to take physical books, cut them apart, and then piece them back together into something new, but this feels very permanent.  (See Sweet Agatha for one inspiration.  Also De Profundis.)<br/><br/>I feel like a wiki-based game with rules for what and when you can change in a document  might meet the need. However, I do want to capture a story element.  I want to allow for the same, where a meta-plot evolves even as the players alter the plot (or plots) of the book(s) that are the subject of the game.  (How to Host a Dungeon does this in a more-or-less implicit solo-fun sort of way.)  An initial thought I had was a logic discovery sort of game (for example, there is an Icehouse game in which you try to guess the koan of the master) but this doesn't provide meta-plot.<br/><br/>So this is where I sit.  I will admit that I find myself blocked by my natural inclination to think in terms of numbers and mechanics.  I will greatly welcome suggestions that help me evolve this game further.  And now, back to my parody of Johnathan Swift.<br/><br/><i>"I profess, in the sincerity of my heart, that I have not the least personal interest in endeavoring to promote this necessary work, having no other motive than the public good of my country, by advancing our trade, providing for sequels, relieving the poor, and giving some pleasure to the rich. I have no novels by which I can propose to get a single penny; the newest being nine years old, and my word-processor past book-bearing."</i><br/><br/><br/>(Cross-posted from my LJ.)<br/><br/>Ps. This feels bigger than a little idea, but smaller than a game design help request.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167764/#Comment_167764" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T12:45:28+00:00" title="September  8, 2008 12:45PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For no reason at all, the phrase "Index by Appendix!" comes sprinting through my brain, and refuses to explain itself.

BookCorp Inc. creates Books(1).  All of them.  Well, nearly all - but the executives don't like to talk about the ones made elsewhere.  <br/><br/>While many of the employees of BookCorp labour in Plot and Character Construction and many others collect salaries as Executives, you and your peers are Editorial Consultants.  It is your job to be certain that BookCorp gives it's customers what they want.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Executives don't know what the customers want(2).  Instead, they issue general statements like "make this Book better" or "edit this Book so it speaks to our chief demographic", leaving you and your colleagues to make your best guess on how to accomplish this goal and thus to get a good review at the end of the project.  Which means you get a raise - or at least that you don't get fired.<br/><br/>The good news(3) is that you also secretly have the backing of one of the mysterious Board Members. Your backer has his or her own goal - it is much more specific and far-reaching than the goals of the Executives.  Things like "I want to bring back olde fashyoned values by reinstating Olde Englysh" or "Increase profits by reducing the size of all books as much as possible".  If you can make your backer happy, then you just might get a promotion.<br/><br/>So, your goal in life is to make your boss happy, make your secret backer happy, and not piss off your co-workers(4), and get home in time for dinner. Simple.  Right?<br/><br/>Oh, one more thing. Like any company, real or allegorical, you have limited resources to work with.  So that means we have rules about how we do things.  We'll get into more detail later, but in short, the bigger the section of text you work with the smaller the changes you can make.  But that shouldn't be a problem for an expert Editorial Consultant like you, right?<br/><br/><br/><br/>(1) Capitalization intentional.  BookCorp does not _print_ books.  That is for real companies in the real world.  BookCorp creates Books - the iconic essence of every book in creation that ultimately get published (or not) in the real world.  A single Book can serve as the iconic bluepring for millions of books, but each edition is typically a different Book.  But we'll talk more about editions later.<br/><br/>(2) Or don't care. Or aren't sharing. Or some combination of the three.  It doesn't really matter, the end result is the same.<br/><br/>(3) For a definition of good that may well not be to your benefit at all.  In fact, it may well mean bad, but we can fix that in editting, right?<br/><br/>(4) Did I mention your co-workers are working on the same Book and have thier own ideas about how to keep the boss happy?  Oh, and they have thier own secret backers, but you're not supposed to know about that.  Anyway, if you piss off your co-workers, they will badmouth you to the boss, which will decrease your chance of getting a good review.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
