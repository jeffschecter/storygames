I've no desire to play oppressed women fighting against The Man. Firstly, it's dull; secondly, it's preachy. But the theme of oppression is a good one to play with.<br/><br/>Let's go sci-fi.\n<blockquote><b>Setting</b><br/><br/>For hundreds of years, the Earth has been ruled by Machines: artificial intelligences who rule for their own ends. They take care of the Humans: provide for them, keep them safe, assign work to them. Meanwhile, they start wars and plunder the Earth's resources.<br/><br/>Many Humans are happy. But some are beginning to rebel. They wonder: do they have a greater place? Could they rule alongside the Machines: or, even, for themselves?</blockquote>\nThat'll do. Machines are the analogue of Men; Humans are the analogue of Women. Let's make the connection explicit.\n<blockquote><b>Setting Design</b><br/><br/>With your group, pick a culture where men have or had some  power over women. Answer these three questions:<br/><br/>1. What attributes did the men display that kept the women at bay? Choose a few. (For example: aggressiveness, scientific thinking)<br/>2. What did the men want? Choose one item. (For example: money, an empire, knowledge)<br/>3. What did the men need from the women to get them this? (For example: a home, menial work)<br/><br/>The attributes that the men displayed, in the culture you chose, will be attributes shown by the Machines.<br/><br/>Whatever the men wanted, in the culture you chose, will be what the Machines want.<br/><br/>Whatever the men needed from the women, in the culture you chose, will be what the Machines need from the humans.<br/><br/>Heighten all of these: if the men wanted the women to provide them with a home, then the Machines want the humans to construct them a glorious new residence.</blockquote>\nSo, now, we want a system. Since it's a game about oppression, let's hack My Life With Master. So it'll work like this:\n<blockquote>Machines = Men (in the original culture) = The Master (in the My Life With Master rules)<br/>Humans = Women (in the original culture) = Minions (in the My Life With Master rules)</blockquote>\nThe Machines (as the Master) are basically designed. Let's make it clear that the Machines are not obviously <i>evil</i>, as the Master is. They believe themselves to be benevolent and, indeed, other Humans agree with them. <br/><br/>We must redefine Fear and Reason:\n<blockquote><b>Designing the Machines</b><br/><br/><b>Fear</b> is replaced by <b>Control</b>, the degree of power the Machines have over the Humans.<br/><br/><b>Reason</b> is replaced by <b>Questioning</b>, the level to which other Humans, and some Machines, have begun questioning the status quo.</blockquote>\nCharacter creation time:\n<blockquote><b>Designing the Humans</b><br/><br/>Humans are designed in a similar way to Minions, in the original My Life With Master.<br/><br/>However, <b>Self-loathing</b> is replaced with <b>Machine</b>, the extent to which the Human has taken on the attitudes of the Machines (as chosen above).<br/><br/><b>Weariness</b> becomes <b>Resignation</b>, the degree to which the Human has accepted his place as a servant of the Machines.<br/><br/><b>Less Than Human</b> becomes <b>Less Than A Machine</b>, a way in which the Human is dramatically less powerful than a Machine (qualified by an "except/unless" condition, as in the original rules).<br/><br/><b>More Than Human</b> becomes <b>More Than A Machine</b>, a way in which the Human is dramatically more powerful than a Machine (qualified by an "except/unless" condition).<br/><br/><b>Connections</b> and <b>Love</b> remain the same.</blockquote>\nAnd the game proceeds exactly as My Life With Master, with the Machines setting tasks for the Humans. Everything's pretty much the same, especially the Intimacy, Desperation and Sincerity dice.<br/><br/><b>The Horror Revealed</b> is a scene in which the power underlying the oppression is given full rein: perhaps the Machines sweep above the Human's homes, destroying them with incredible firepower.<br/><br/>The Endgame conditions change a little:\n<blockquote>1. RESIGNATION greater than QUESTIONING plus MACHINE: The Human becomes resigned to, or integrates into, Machine society.<br/>2. MACHINE plus RESIGNATION greater than LOVE plus QUESTIONING : The Human becomes an automaton, all will being broken by the Machines.<br/>3. MACHINE greater than RESIGNATION plus QUESTIONING: The Human is destroyed in a last stand against the machines.<br/>4. LOVE plus QUESTIONING greater than MACHINE plus RESIGNATION : Change happens: the Human decides his or her place in the new society and may decide whether or not the Machines play a part in it.<br/>5. LOVE equals zero: The Human becomes one with the Machines: either literally or by taking on their attitudes completely.</blockquote>\nWow, My Life With Master works well with dystopias, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kleenestar" title="kleenestar"><img alt="kleenestar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.replayable.net/pics/kleenestar.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kleenestar">kleenestar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72138/#Comment_72138" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T06:48:06+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  6:48AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, would you play this?

It just has to be done carefully. I'm thinking that the types of conflicts you'd get if you were looking explicitly at female characters in the same setting vs. inexplicit (default male?) genders.<br/><br/>The big thing I see here is reproduction, and I think it's going to be hard to analogize the relationship between men and women into this particular setting.<br/><br/>To me, this is a better game for dealing with issues about racial oppression and an economic underclass than about sexism. I think you are making assumptions about the experience of sexist oppression and translating that too literally into species oppression, which ends up making it too generically about oppression and no longer about sexism.<br/><br/>Sexism doesn't work the same way as racism (for example), because the unique factors are pretty different. Your game here probably works better as a game about immigration patterns than about gender issues.<br/><br/>(Also, I have some problems with the endgame results, which seem kind of arbitrary and furthermore don't reflect the types of choices actually taken by oppressed groups in a larger culture.

It's difficult, because, to avoid the preachy thing, I'm deliberately trying to abstract the issues into a different setting. Problem is, I may have lost the issues.<br/><br/>I'm not too worried about reproduction, unless, you know, you can see a reason why I should be.\n<blockquote>Sexism doesn't work the same way as racism (for example), because the unique factors are pretty different.</blockquote>\nCould you explain?\n<blockquote>(Also, I have some problems with the endgame results, which seem kind of arbitrary and furthermore don't reflect the types of choices actually taken by oppressed groups in a larger culture.

Women don't live in isolated ghettos (<i>perhaps the Machines sweep above the Human's homes, destroying them with incredible firepower</i>) from men. All men that exist now came from women, and most want to have sex with a woman. The result is not going to be just another man, but may be either a man or a woman. Women (often) want to have sex with men as well, and for their own benefits also.<br/><br/>Leaving reproduction out of the game totally kills the interdependency aspect, and it makes this more an analogy for racial/class/ethnic/nationality-based oppression than for sexism.<br/><br/>Which still makes it a pretty neat idea, don't get me wrong! I am very interested in games which push players to take on the roles of less privileged people and then see what they might decide to do.<br/><br/>I think you'd be better off using this idea to examine a different type of oppression than trying to force yourself into making a "feminist" game. This is cool idea, and I think the idea of making a "feminist" game that will please "feminists" makes as much sense as "feminists" making a "feminist" game that will please you. Right now you're not really in the feminist mindset (and you may not want to be there), so it may be better to write what you know about.<br/><br/>You seem to have a good grasp on what could be fun and interesting to play in this setting. I just don't think it will explore the issues of feminism as well as other issues. (For example, in the Endgame, those are all much closer to ethnic subculture assimilation responses to majority culture than female responses to sexism.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72947/#Comment_72947" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T14:16:15+00:00" title="May 31, 2007  2:16PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consider this:<br/><br/>The machines need the humans to reproduce (i.e. make more of them).

This kind of spins from what you were suggesting on Sunday, no? I would be up for giving i a throw, but I agree that it needs a bit more to focus on feminist issues. Reproduction, as suggested. Also, possibly, fascination/pursuit of humans by machines - both at a mass level and at a more extreme level by individual machines, whose actions are implicitly sanctioned by the culture. Every machine sharing a home with a human. Basically ways of having the two cultures totally intertwined, but in a way that opens up dysfunctional power relationships.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73770/#Comment_73770" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T09:49:18+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  9:49AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            but how dysfunction can a relattion between man and machine really be. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought the idea isn't that male female power realtions are dysfunction but rather dysfunction ' for no good reason ' as men and women are close enough to the same for the differences not to matter ( much or at all depending on who you ask) <br/>\n<br/>\nBut man and machine are obiviously very different, and these differences matter a whole lot to the game.

Hmm. Maybe. It all depends on how the machines are construed. If they are genuinely unable to get along with the humans, they are genuinely true different, then you do get a tragic story of the impossibility of living together, which I agree is totally counter to feminism as I understand it. It's Machines are from Mars, Humans are from Venus.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you could construct it as the machines having co-evolved alongside of humans (or been produced by humans) in order to be compatible, with something gone somewhat awry along the way, due to the machine culture or the intrinsic strength, weaponry, armour or clumsiness of machines leading to different roles at some point in history. On that second point, maybe history threw up a crisis where the machines fought in a tribal fashion, and the humans did the best they could to get out the way, and since then these roles have become fixed, even though the reality of modern society doesn't reflect this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73997/#Comment_73997" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T11:54:15+00:00" title="June  6, 2007 11:54AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah thats more or less what im saying but the more human a machine is the more human it is, which draws out the question is being human an essential part of being human more than the questtion of relative powere dynamics<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the game ought to be the machines being appressed by man rather than the other way around, i think that would skip the above question and get back to the real question<br/>\n<br/>\nand yes i am a dirty essentialist and i like to keep my feminist and queer theory seperate, just so you know where im comingn from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
