You face danger and death, and survive by the use of your wits, a sharp sword, and steely thews.<br/><br/>The world of On Mighty Thews is created by the players. You create a map which reflects in the world the internal conflicts of the characters, conflicts like the struggle between civilisation and savagery, fate and free will, or honour and treachery. The characters are outsiders, caught between these warring factions both internally, and in the world around them.<br/><br/>In On Mighty Thews, the players contribute to the ongoing narrative of play. Facing danger, success can allow you to determine facts about the world around you, related to your success. What did you spot, creeping through the savannah grass? What does the captive warrior reveal about the plans of her master? These questions could be up to you, the player, to answer. While one player, the Game Master, is responsible for tying the story together into scenes, and determining the consequences when your character fails, all the players have a hand in shaping the story.<br/><br/>On Mighty Thews can be played to a satisfying conclusion inside two hours, and works best with a small group of two or three people. The stories you tell will be weird and bloody, and a shared appreciation for the sword and sorcery genre is an advantage, though the book has resources to help you get on the same page. No additional preparation or planning is required before you start play.<br/><br/>For more information about how the game works, check out these <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1164498/Thews%20Play-Aids.pdf" rel="nofollow">play aids</a>, which are a summary of the rules of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323647/#Comment_323647" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T17:28:36+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  5:28PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also like how the game is full of spontaneously-created flags for the GM.

The closer you are to that pole, the stronger that character trait is expressed in the cities and peoples in that area of the map.<br/><br/>As you go further away from that pole, the civilisations, people, monsters and sites of adventure become weaker or more oppositional to that trait.<br/><br/>So, if your character has a central trait of being 'Melancholic', there would be a City of Tears and Loss near the melancholic pole, and a Desert of Forgetfulness at the far end of the map.<br/><br/>Is that right?<br/><br/>It's a process that reminds me of this quote from Michael Moorcock on world-building: "My worlds are always inner (unconscious) worlds made manifest."<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=31497.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=31497.0</a><br/><br/>EDIT: Oh!

I've been able to whip up that sort of play without a game dedicated to it, but maybe that's a lucky accident.</blockquote>\nWhat On Mighty Thews does is not so much<i>produce</i>fiction that fits within the sword and sorcery genre, as it<i>responds to</i>fiction that does so. The rules assume a group that's already committed to making a sword and sorcery story, and then gives them a rules framework that makes that compelling and interesting - preserving the in-fiction conflicts of interest against the unity of interest of the group.<br/><br/>The "d20 Trait" mechanic is a good example of this. Your character has a trait that represents a core duality within them. "Civilised" for example, or "Fatalistic". When you act according to that trait, you get a re-roll token at the end of each scene. When you act against that trait, you get to roll a d20 in a conflict. So the civilised barbarian, when pressed, can revert to savagery and gain the advantage. The doomed hero can, in the heat of battle, defy their fatalistic nature and triumph.<br/><br/>Those things are possible without the d20 trait mechanic, but what the rule does is push that theme to the forefront - it makes us take notice of how the character is acting in terms of their thematic issue. The game responds to fiction that suits its core themes.Cool.  That it's responding sounds good to me.  <br/><br/>But it's doing more than that; it's responding in a specific way.  "Do the thing you <i>are</i>, and win later.  Do the thing you <i>could be</i>, and win now."  <br/><br/>Which of your purposes is that serving?  Is that emulating S&amp;S fiction?

It's not so much about "who you could be vs. who you are" as it is about the protagonist trying to be both at once. Conan (who is really just Tarzan in a fantasy setting) is eternally caught between being a savage, and being civilised.

Mostly it's just about creating two beneficial but mechanically distinct options. They're both good, but one can't replace the other. If you were getting, say, "Roll +1" tokens for acting both for and against the trait, they'd be mechanically interchangable, and the distinction would be meaningless. Having them distinct makes it matter which one you're doing. You don't know how to use the rules without judging the fiction.<br/><br/>But also I like the way acting against your trait makes for dramatic moments in the game. For example, Malcolm Craig played a character with "Gloomy" as his d20 trait. He was this sour, grumpy loner. But when shit got real he'd be laughing, grinning, making sardonic jokes. There was this great scene with him piloting a glass-skimmer through a collapsing canyon of glass, wind whipping his hair, laughing wildly. He only felt alive when he was close to death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324199/#Comment_324199" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T17:06:52+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  5:06PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Malcolm Craig played a character with "Gloomy" as his d20 trait.

I'm asking about what you wanted the mechanic to accomplish.<br/><br/>Thus far, my understanding of what you wanted the mechanic to accomplish is:<br/>1) highlight the existence of the poles<br/>2) highlight the tension between the poles<br/><br/>You chose to pursue that by:<br/>3) giving players a choice between the poles<br/>4) making that choice matter to character success/failure<br/>5) making the choice not always have the same obvious correct answer<br/><br/>It seems that all this is very intentional.  Like, you set out to do that and did it.<br/><br/>However, your specific implementation adds in another dynamic!  Your means of achieving (5) in the context of (4) is Instant Bonus vs Re-roll Token, which introduces a dynamic of Win Now vs Win Later.<br/><br/>What's fictionally correlated with Win Now and Win Later?  Acting against the d20 trait you've written vs acting in accordance with it.<br/><br/>What does the d20 trait represent?  Which pole is written on the sheet?  If you envision a character struggling between Civilization and Savagery, which one do you write down?<br/><br/>From your examples and the language of the rules describing the choice, I've gotten the impression that you write down the pole that is better, more desirable, and/or more prominent for your character.  So I probably write down Civilization.<br/><br/>The ultimate fictional result is that acting according to your better nature lets you Win Later and giving in to your baser nature lets you Win Now.  I get the impression that you didn't specifically plan this.  I am wondering how you view it:<br/><br/>a) Hey, this isn't <i>reading</i> S&amp;S, this is a <i>game</i>, so it's gotta make its own unique contribution.  "Vice pays off short term and virtue pays off long term" is my addition to S&amp;S.<br/><br/>b) Oh, hey, I lucked out!  In S&amp;S fiction, vice <i>does</i> pay off quick and virtue <i>does</i> pay off long-term!  Perfect!  Maybe I was subconsciously aware of that the whole time...<br/><br/>c) Ew, crap, that is very <i>not</i> S&amp;S.  It would suck if that actually was a major feature of play.<br/><br/>Depending on your answer, I might suggest more explicit guidance about how to pick which pole to write down as your d20 trait.  That's my practical takeaway.  Primarily, though, I'm just curious about your design process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324979/#Comment_324979" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T14:37:15+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  2:37PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2011 2:45PM by Simon_C.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint&amp;Sinner</cite>I usually don't ask for this but have major S&amp;S characters like Conan, etc been made up in OMT? I'm trying to see how that d20 trait would translate into characters I know before striking out on my own.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Scott</blockquote>\nHi! Good question. You could represent Conan's deal with a d20 trait in a couple of different ways. Depending on the story, it could be "Savage" (he's an uncultured primitive most of the time, but he also has moments of intelligence and planning which save the day) or it could be "Civilised" (he has a veneer of civilisation, but in the clinch his barbaric nature reasserts itself, and he triumphs). "Civilised" probably suits the later (in-fiction chronologically) Conan better, while "Savage" is better for the young Conan.<br/><br/>David, (and Scott, this might be useful for you too)<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it's about Vice and Virtue, it's more about "Surface" and "Core".<br/><br/>S&amp;S, like a lot of fiction, is preoccupied with the question of the fundamental nature of its characters. Is Conan civilised or savage? Does Elric have free will, or is he bound to his fate? Are Fafhrd and the Mouser (I consider them essentially two halves of the same character) honourable men, or merely mercenary cutthroats? S&amp;S tends to focus on dualities, and it's distinctive of the genre that these dualities are never resolved in a tidy arc, but are pretty much eternal. What we see is the question about the characters' nature being raised again and again in each story, and never fully answered (Side note: Tanith Lee is a bit different from this, and it's also worth noting that she writes novels rather than short stories. That's probably important!).<br/><br/>So in On Mighty Thews, the d20 traits really represent a <i>question</i> about the character, rather than a particular virtue. They say "Is this character like this?"<br/><br/>The "succeed now or succeed later" thing is basically about making it so that the decision about whether to follow the trait is most acute when the character is under pressure. It's when the character is in conflict that we most care about how they're acting in relation to their trait. That's just a trick to make the game respond to escalating tension, which is a feature of pretty much all fiction.<br/><br/>Which "side" of the d20 trait you choose to write down is essentially an artistic decision, and it depends on how you imagine the character acting under pressure. It's a hard thing to explain, but easy to understand once you've used the mechanic a couple of times. For that reason, the game text says "Choose your d20 trait from this list if it's your first time playing". I suspect not many people will follow that rule though, probably to the detriment of their play experience.<br/><br/>Maybe if you wanna talk about this more, we could start another thread? I'd especially love it if anyone who has played the game could post about their experiences. Playtesting suggests to me that the mechanic doesn't always work how people expect, and sometimes a game can fall flat if people choose the wrong traits. I don't really know how to fix that problem though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324982/#Comment_324982" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T14:48:29+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  2:48PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Playtesting suggests to me that the mechanic doesn't always work how people expect, and sometimes a game can fall flat if people choose the wrong traits.

I can easily imagine, for example, a social conflict (negotiation with a ruler in a public setting? etiquette? trying to persuade someone to help you?) when you would need to overcome Savagery and act Civilized in order to get the immediate d20 that will help you get your way-- Savagery is more likely to get you killed/imprisoned/discredited/etc., even if it is really your fundamental nature. If you refuse to act civilized (and thus fail to get your way in the immediate social negotiation), then you get a re-roll token by acting in accordance with your basic Savage nature-- but things also escalate in the present moment. This sort of situation is what causes the tension between your nature and the way your want or need to be in a particular circumstance, and writing either Savage <i>or</i> Civilized leads to these sorts of problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325161/#Comment_325161" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T14:09:28+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  2:09PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes perfect sense if (a) I can't anticipate what sorts of conflicts I'll be in (e.g. slaying vs persuading), or (b) I anticipate being in roughly half where being civilized is advantageous and half where being savage is advantageous.  Is either of these the case?<br/><br/>Let's imagine an alternative ruleset, in which the fictional situation dictates the poles' mechanical impact:<br/>1) rather than writing down "savage" or "civilized", we write "savage-civilized"<br/>2) each time we roll in a conflict, before rolling, we go, "Which is more advantageous here, savagery or acting civilized?"  This is based purely on the fiction.<br/>3) whichever pole is more advantageous gets you a d20 if you use it<br/>4) whichever pole is less advantageous gets you re-roll token if you use it<br/><br/>Thus, we wind up with an obvious connection between fictional and mechanical "win now" logic and incentives.

It's a small difference, but it's important because:<br/><br/>a) it stops you from getting and then immediately using a re-roll, which would make the comparison of benefits between d20 and re-roll more acute.<br/>b) it means we assume you act in accordance with your d20 trait unless you specifically act against it.<br/>c) the "once per scene" limit means you pick your moment more carefully, and balances it against the one-re-roll per scene.<br/><br/>For the most part, you can't anticipate what kinds of conflicts you'll be in. But! In OMT, it doesn't matter what kind of conflict you're in as to whether you can get the d20 bonus. Consider, with the "Civilised" d20 trait:<br/><br/>You're trying to convince the Raj to send his warriors to my country's aid. The danger is that he is offended by your request (in OMT you only roll a conflict if there is personal danger to one of the characters). You roll your "Explorer" attribute (it's used when you're dealing with exotic peoples), and your "Widely-Travelled" ability, since you're using the language of the Raj here. You roll the dice, and if you succeed, you get the stakes (he sends his warriors) and if you succeed well, you can add facts on top of that "He invites us to ride in his palanquin" or "he agrees to come personally" or whatever you like.<br/><br/>But say you don't have that "Widely travelled" ability, and your "Explorer" attribute sucks. You need that d20 if you're going to succeed. So you say "My dude vaults over the table, backhands the guy in the face, and bellows "Send your warriors or by the gods I'll kill you and all who stand with you!". You roll your Explorer die still (you're still negotiating with exotic peoples) but now you're acting against your d20 trait, so you can roll in your d20 as well.<br/><br/>EDIT: On the "guidance for that" thing. The recommended d20 traits list has "Civilised" but not "Savage" on it, for this reason. You could, though, play a character who uses unexpected cunning and sophistication in the clinch to win conflicts (as does the young Conan). "Savage" would be a good d20 trait for that character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325175/#Comment_325175" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T14:48:51+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  2:48PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stephen,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Stephen P</cite><br/>If you want this, then just pick the *opposite* d20 Trait.

I really need to play it to know more about how I feel, especially about the d20 trait (which has occupied folks' attention so much, I see). <br/><br/>So - I was driving my girlfriend to work today, and I... think the story was <i>Ill Met in Lankhmar</i>. Faf and the Mouser party with their lady companions, they go out for more booze, and BAM! They come back to find two charred corpses and evidence that sorcery had been used. The way they respond to this, seeing them all wroth with vengeance, is pretty cool to watch as it unfolds. It's also ... well, not <i>out</i> of character for them, but definitely it's a side to them they usually keep on the back burner.<br/><br/>Thinking about this example from fiction got me thinkin' that the d20 trait's <i>converse</i> is where the juicy stuff is - we're entertained by F&amp;M's general wittiness, carefree attitude, and sarcastic banter, and then we maybe feel a little moved to see them charging off to take revenge like that. The fact that they had to be pushed so far in order to reach that point makes it all the more meaningful and interesting. <br/><br/>It might even make sense to label the d20 trait with something that <i>isn't</i> who you are, but rather some small part of you that you don't show to people much. Something you struggle to hide, maybe, or something you're very reluctant to do. Elric being mirthful, or Conan feeling at ease at a formal event; that kind of thing. Maybe even a touch of Gandalf's wrath in there, too. <br/><br/>Actually, on some level, this is kind of like a Key that doesn't go away - you can get small bonuses by acting in accordance with it, but the big bonus comes along when you contradict the Key.

People wanted a 'helping rule' akin to passing dice in Burning games, or Aid Another in D&amp;D.  We talked about maybe allowing players being able to throw +1s they gained from margin of success to other players, but after having read a few cool threads about 'fictional positioning' on s-g lately I think the OMT 'helping rule' ought to be that you can roll to establish facts  that are useful to your friend.<br/><br/>2. There's no explicit downside to a missed Lore roll, which feels odd.   It would be cool if missed Lore rolls had some impact beyond just fizzling.  The unspoken ethos of OMT seems to be, if you want authorial power, you have to put your character into harm's way.  I'd like some way to do this with Lore rolls.  <br/><br/>3. Can failed Lore rolls be retried?  That seems lame, so I'd guess not.  <br/><br/>4. When does the GM get to author facts?  Anytime they like?<br/><br/>5. Those dirty sneaky hippie players authored facts without rolling -- when they washed up on the Island of Mad Jesters, one of them said, "do not eat the fruit!  It causes the madness!"  This seemed good to everyone so we ran with it.  <br/><br/>6. Those filthy munchkins also established facts that did away with injuries.  Since disposing of injuries has its own mechanic, I wonder if this is a good idea.  For example, one of the injuries we inflicted on our erstwhile ex-Admiral was "mad crew" because they ate the Mad Jester Island fruit.  Later, a cure for the madness was facted into existence.  What to do with the injury?<br/><br/>7. The fighting rules refer to a single PC vs. multiple opponents.  We stumbled over this because we had multiple PCs and multiple opponents.  When that happens, I'm guessing we should 'take turns', with Player A rolling against all the opposition, then Player B rolling against their opposition, then Player C rolling against all their opposition...<br/><br/>8. I'd really like the GMs role to be enumerated in a reference sheet somewhere.  The list would include things like<br/>* Framing scenes<br/>* Saying "No, you can't reroll that Lore test."<br/>* Generating and playing NPCs.<br/>* Keeping track of what's been established and gatekeeping the fiction to keep it consistent.<br/>* Introducing facts at the appropriate time.<br/>* Determining interesting consequences when rolls fail.<br/>* Inflicting injuries<br/><br/>But there was a lot that was golden about this game -- it provoked lots of cool ideas at the table, so it's a winner in my book.  Thanks to Simon for a cool little game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325376/#Comment_325376" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T13:27:38+00:00" title="May 19, 2011  1:27PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I plead for understanding.  I have Story-Fruit Brain Madness.  It didn't have to be true!

Especially our map, all the characters' interactions at the Sea of Gibbets, and the wild conclusion at the City of Lepers.

I'm glad you had a good time. Those are good questions.<br/><br/>1. At present, there is no explicit "helping" rule, except in as much as you can establish facts that are useful to each other. But! Characters with the same goal in a conflict can roll their dice together.<br/><br/>2. There is no explicit downside. The implicit downside is that you don't know anything about this place. Feel free to hack one in though!<br/><br/>3. No retries! That does suck.<br/><br/>4. Any time they like. Remeber I wrote this game in like, 2007. If I started over now I'd give the GM all like, rules for when to make stuff up. As it is you'll have to play it by ear.<br/><br/>5. I've seen this too! It's really tempting to let it go, but it's much better not to.<br/><br/>6. Depends on the injury. You can only author facts that relate to the conflict you just won. No "I throw the leech-woman off the cliff, and for a fact, my leech-wounds are healing up now". But for injuries where you can conceivably have a conflict about fixing them, go ahead and fact them away.<br/><br/>7. Multiple characters with the same intent can roll together. In a melee with lots of different intents, taking turns is fine. Let the fiction guide you. In OMT the GM kind of has to "coreograph" fights a little.<br/><br/>8. That's a good idea! I'm working on making some better play-aids, and that will definitely go in there.<br/><br/>"Sea of Gibbets" is blowing my mind. That sounds like good stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325378/#Comment_325378" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T13:49:25+00:00" title="May 19, 2011  1:49PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2011 1:49PM by Simon_C.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!<br/><br/>If you wanna talk about your game more, maybe start a new thread?
