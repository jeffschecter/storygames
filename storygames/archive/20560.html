The game created a small wiki describing a setting which the players created together.<br/><br/>Every player created a page which began with 'A'. The listing had to link to an as-yet-uncreated page which began with 'B'.<br/><br/>When everyone had made their 'A' page, everyone chose a 'B' page to write. You couldn't choose a page which you yourself had linked to.<br/><br/>Every 'B' page had to link to a 'C' page, and so on through the alphabet.<br/><br/>I remember reading the rules online, but haven't been able to find them again.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451687/#Comment_451687" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-29T06:28:30+00:00" title="February 29, 2016  6:28AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2016 6:30AM by amphigorist.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe you're thinking of <a href="http://www.twistedconfessions.com/confessional/index.php?n=Lexicon.HomePage" rel="nofollow">Lexicon </a>by Neel Krishnaswami (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080617213627/http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html" rel="nofollow">wayback machine of original posting</a>).
