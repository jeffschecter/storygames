Speaking of which, why did you choose Volatile as the other high stat? I can't see much that keys off it. Could you simplify things a bit, conceptually and sub-stat move wise, if Hot was at +1 instead?  Your Genie seems to be about Hot and Dark, all smoldering glances, complicated power relationships and sexual tension building resentment towards the lamp holder, before an eruption of evil genie magics changes everything.<br/><br/>The planeswalker move is the exception, but it could maybe be (paraphrasing) 'When you Run Away by passing momentarily through your home plane roll with Dark, and you have these options instead'.   (Which I just realised brings back in the stat sub.  Ho hum). Choosing this move says things about the Genie, captivity in the lamp, freedom to leave, their binding to this plane, and so on.  Might be worth calling out in the How to play notes.<br/><br/>I had a few other thoughts, (other than this is a really cool skin), if you're looking for feedback. My Command- you'll already be getting the lamp holder (and your lover) to offer you XP for wishes, via Your Wish, so does it need a double up move?  It might not be a problem in play, however, and I guess technically doesn't violate the singleton rule.  Cool to have this move name pair, though.  Nice.<br/><br/>Oh, wait, on the sex move, who does Your Wish apply to?  Who burns the string, and who rolls with Dark?  Does it mean people you have sex with get untrammeled access to super awesome genie magics they have no sense of responsibility about when you ask them for some small favour?  That's hot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398167/#Comment_398167" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T02:16:32+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  2:16AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2012 2:27AM by Cneph.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe a move for offering Wishes (giving way a String) for some benefit to you?

Like, if the NPC wishes for a million dollars, the Genie has to go rob a bank?<br/><br/>I think the core dynamic of the playbook is great, but I struggle to reconcile the above possibility with the idea of an actual Genie, in the fiction. Like, the Witch can cast actual spells -- a pissed off Witch with super-powered hexes has some serious crap to throw around -- but it seems like the Genie can only perform parlor tricks for a single audience member. So... what's their leverage? Where's the monstrous power? What makes the Darkest Self of a Genie actually scary, beyond malicious intent?<br/><br/>Personally I would like to see a Genie who has genuine cosmic power when it comes to fulfilling Wishes, but who in all other situations is basically just a basic move machine with a whole lot of favours owed. The Genie's thing then becomes trying to manipulate their master into Wishing for things that benefit them, and building up Strings so that their Darkest Self becomes an increasingly looming threat. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398189/#Comment_398189" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T09:13:53+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  9:13AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2012 9:17AM by Cneph.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, I read the 'choose two things you can't do' under Your Wish as explicitly granting permission to do the others.

So, basically, if I hold the lamp, and I want the genie to do something for me, then my option is to get them to roll a basic move (as most of the Genie moves seem to relate to the Genie) at +3 (assuming they took Phenomenal Cosmic Power and the +1 stat to Dark)?<br/><br/>If you only have 3 wishes, then I guess figuring out which 3 rolls you really want +3 on is cool.  It's just odd to my concept of genies that you can't ask one to do something truly crazy, and that one could also fail.<br/><br/>My concept of genies may not apply, though, as the classic model wouldn't be any fun to play.  I assume a PC genie is intended to have its own pursuits when not being ordered around, rather than just sitting in a lamp offscreen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398279/#Comment_398279" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T01:04:45+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  1:04AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cneph: I chose Volatile as the other high stat because 1. genies can fuck your shit up, either with super powers or (in the movie that directly inspired this skin) with martial arts, and 2. genies are pretty much always Volatile\u2014it\u2019s what makes them scary. Hot was an attractive option, but genies aren\u2019t hot because they\u2019re sexy\u2014they\u2019re hot because God made them from actual searing fire, which is really more Volatile than Hot in M&lt;3 terms. Volatile also figures significantly into the Darkest Self.<br/><br/>Re: My Command: you get XP when someone spends a String on you for any reason, not just when they spend it to offer you XP. So if they spend a String to hurt your roll, you get XP for that. That means that, yes, if they offer you XP to do something and you say yes, you get 2xp\u2014which was the intent, because as a genie that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. Then again, there is the disincentive to say no from the 1-harm you take from Your Wish; do you think that might be enough, such that My Command would only fire on other types of String usage?<br/><br/>The sex move means that when you, the Genie, offer your lover XP to do something, your lover either says no and takes 1-harm, or says yes and can roll with Dark to do stuff, etc. etc.<br/><br/>I like the idea of a move that allows you to give other people Strings on you actively. How about this:<br/><br/>\u25cb &lt;b&gt;Heart\u2019s Desire<br/>When someone reveals a secret desire to you, you may choose to give them a String on you and the Condition <i>tempted.</i><br/><br/>ICE: Yeah, I did want to force the Genie to use a lot of basic moves to get stuff done. One of my favorite things about Monsterhearts is the fact that all the basic moves seem just a few degrees to the left of what you really really want them to do. The same way that the Vampire can be a zillion-year-old elder antediluvian or whatever you want to call them but isn\u2019t necessarily much more powerful than any other Skin, the Genie is powerful and dedicated and focused, but needs to be a little more subtle than Robin Williams\u2014more in line with Amitabh Bachchan\u2019s Genius (or, for that matter, Sanjay Dutt\u2019s Ringmaster).<br/><br/>You guys are right though, the Genie needs at least a little more explicit magic power. I\u2019m going to think about ways to amp up Tak Dhina Din, though I\u2019m worried about it becoming the killer app. Here\u2019s my initial thought:<br/><br/>\u25cb <b>Tak Dhina Din</b><br/>You can perform impressive magical feats such as making a carpet fly, transforming a street-rat into a prince, or summoning a hundred backup dancers for an impromptu musical number, but your power is somehow restricted\u2014choose two restraints when you get this move, and fulfill one or the other every time you use it:<br/>\u2022 no more than one person can be watching<br/>\u2022 it at least has to look like it happened by chance, not magic<br/>\u2022 it upsets the fabric of the universe, allowing the MC to make a hard move<br/>\u2022 you must be your Darkest Self<br/>\u2022 it causes collateral damage\u2014someone within its area of effect takes 1-harm<br/>\u2022 you have to recite an embarrassingly corny catchphrase every time you cast a spell\u2014ask another player to make it up for you, and give a String to anyone who hears you say it<br/><br/>D-Berg: Yeah, that was my intent. This character is still an awkward teenager who\u2019s coming into their powers from an oft-inconvenient direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398293/#Comment_398293" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T05:33:41+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  5:33AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That version of Tak Dhina Din is MUCH more useful.

I think it's worth considering whether there is a version of the Genie that both has immense wish-granting power AND is totally playable as a PC. <br/><br/>The Genie who is just coming into his power is an interesting angle, but to me that is something best conveyed by a very potent, wish-specific move with a lot of troublesome 7-9 results (and possibly even an imperfect 10+ result), rather than a watered down version of generalized magic. <br/><br/>The version of Tak Dhina Din above doesn't actually look like a move; it looks like a general description of abilities that could be used to generate one or several moves. But also, if the Genie's power comes from granting wishes, then focusing on amping up a non-wish-related move may not be the most thematic solution.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398331/#Comment_398331" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T11:01:21+00:00" title="November 21, 2012 11:01AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2012 11:07AM by Cneph.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             While I still see that list of things you can't do as being permissive, it could be written up in more detail.<br/><br/>Just spitballing here, this undoubtedly needs work.

Your genie magics can do almost anything in granting such a Wish, except you may not (choose two): cause harm to others, use magic directly on humans, affect free will, express love or submission towards the One, change the flow of time. (or similar restrictions)<br/><br/>When you grant a Wish someone has made of you, roll with Dark.  On a 10 up, your cosmic powers fulfill the Wish, but choose one:<br/>-There is a straightforward means to undo the Wish, perhaps one action the wisher must avoid.<br/>-Granting it is incredibly flashy and anyone who figures out you were the source gets a String on you.<br/>-Those close to the wisher know that things aren't 'right' with the new status quo.<br/>On a 7-9, close, but you grant a strictly literal interpretation of the wish wording and choose two:<br/>-Someone else loses what the wisher gains<br/>-You are clearly the source of the wish magic, any onlookers other than the wisher get a String on you.<br/>-You turn Darkest Self and grant the wish from that agenda.<br/>-and a couple more?<br/>On a 6 or less, the MC decides how the wish turns out and can make a hard move against either or both of you.  MC, think full on Evil Genie.  Cosmic powers are difficult to control, after all.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398333/#Comment_398333" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T11:11:12+00:00" title="November 21, 2012 11:11AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

Source material wise it totally makes sense.  It would somewhat reduce the direct impact of the 'onlookers get a String on you' choices- I was thinking they might all come clamouring for wishes too, which seemed to be a theme of the skin, becoming fed up with giving giving giving all the time.\n<blockquote>I don't understand these references to "the One".</blockquote>\nMe either, but I was too lazy to edit it out when posting on my tablet.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I don't think it makes sense on its own as an overall restriction.
