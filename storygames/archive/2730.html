I decided to run a Firefly game and although I am going to have them write up the characters I thought I would show up with some great ideas which they can choose from and be inspired by - breeching the blank slate and all that.<br/><br/>Can those that have played PTA and love Firefly help me out in coming up with a decent list of character issues, edges and connections?  I will have six players - Mal, Zoe, Jayne, River, Simon, &amp; Innara with Wash, Book, Kayle and Serenity as background characters.<br/><br/>Your input is very appreciated,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62443/#Comment_62443" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T09:52:58+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  9:52AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A recent discussion about Firefly as a RPG had one of my friends identifying the cast in PC/NPC relationships, which really map out to PTA's connections.  We aligned them this way:  Mal's major NPC is Kaylee, River's is Simon, Book's is Jayne, and Zoe's is Wash.  (Inara didn't pair up with another cast member.) The thought was Mal, River, Book, and Zoe had enough background and abilities to make them interesting as major characters.  Kaylee, Simon, Jayne, and Wash don't seem to be fleshed out as well (with the possible exception of Simon).  <br/><br/>Even if you discount these pairings and you go with the PC list above, I'd use the other crew members as connections.  Pair up Mal with Kaylee, Zoe with Wash, and Jayne with Book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62562/#Comment_62562" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T10:13:38+00:00" title="March 30, 2007 10:13AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True.

If I were to pull this out to a more tradition group I think it would better be "prepared" with a setting in mind.  Besides, there's a whole section of the book that is devoted to existing series.  I will already be having them talk about issues and traits for the characters (hopefully from a larger list) and what THIS episode is going to focus on.  I believe that to be enough of the PITCH to make it worth while.  Besides, by framing it with "come play the lost episode of Firefly" I think it sets up expectations for the game solidly.  Everyone, even those who have played PTA, can jump right in with ideas of what's going on.<br/><br/>This post was designed to have those that are familiar with PTA and Firefly to give me a better handle on examples from Firelfy for Issues and traits (I have played all of once).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62571/#Comment_62571" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T10:42:34+00:00" title="March 30, 2007 10:42AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW I find that for short conventin games (4 hours or less) I tend to do some of the prep ahead of time.

In my Foundation game, when we were using the Shadowrun 4 ruleset, running a game in PTA really refocused the game back on the characters.  If we were still using that system, I'd still be running every fourth game with PTA to sharpen the focus on the character's wants and needs.  When we did this, we skipped over the pitch segment. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>BTW I find that for short convention games (4 hours or less) I tend to do some of the prep ahead of time</blockquote>\nThe two times I've played PTA in a convention-like game, the pitch segment and the entire playing of the pilot episode didn't last as long as the full 4 hour slot.  With four protagonists, we wrapped the episode at about the three hour mark.  With three protagonists, we wrapped at just after two hours.   For a convention game, you don't have to jettison the pitch part, unless you really want to run that lost episode of Firefly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62585/#Comment_62585" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T11:56:40+00:00" title="March 30, 2007 11:56AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2007 11:59AM by Thomas D.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm assuming you're setting this during Firefly instead of post-Serenity.<br/><br/>Issues that jump out at me for Simon are Love for Kaylee (romantic troubles) or The New Kid on the Block (self-worth).  Edges could be things like Doctor, Booksmart, Upper Class, or Wanted.  His nemesis is Jayne, if he has one.  Personal set would be the medical bag.  Kaylee is his connection.<br/><br/>River is pretty easy -- her issue is They Messed With My Head.  Edges would be along the lines of Wanted, Gifted, Crazy, and Psychic.  Her nemesis would be the Blue Hands men.  Personal set would be her feet.  (Nearly every shot of River in Firefly started on her feet.)  Simon is her connection, but I don't know if you can have another protagonist as a connection.<br/><br/>Inara's issues would tend towards the Romantic Troubles line or something to do with unresolved issues, if you buy into the concept that Inara is on Serenity because she is dying.  I don't think she has a nemesis.  Personal set would be her shuttle.  Connections would be the Companion Registry (or whatever the Companions as a whole were called).  Edges include Companion (obvious), High Maintenance, Can Put Emotions on Hold, Learned, or Upper Class, although I think Companion covers the others.<br/><br/>Mal's issue could either be Self-Destructive, Stay Free, or Love for Inara.  Edges would be Captain Tightpants, Browncoat, or Professional Smuggler (or "The Han Solo Effect").  Connections would be Serenity and The Grey Market.  Personal set would be his trusty sidearm or the actual coat he wears.  Nemesis would be Saffron.<br/><br/>Jayne and Zoe aren't as easy as the earlier ones.<br/><br/>Jayne.  Issue is Greed.  Connections would be Book.  Edges would include Mercenary and Loudmouth.  Personal set? Vera.  I don't think Jayne has a nemesis.<br/><br/>Zoe's issue has to do with duty to her husband and to her captain.  Wash is her connection.  She'd have Browncoat and Wife as edges.  Her personal set would be her room with Wash.  She doesn't have a nemesis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62616/#Comment_62616" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T23:05:18+00:00" title="March 30, 2007 11:05PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2007 11:06PM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought about doing this very thing.  What I'd do is, assuming you've got buy in from all of your players, say to them "We're going to do Firefly with PTA.  I want you guys to choose a character, and you figure out what that character's issue is, what their connections and edges are, and so forth."  Exactly as if you were pitching a standard PTA series, except that you've already decided you're playing Firefly.  So the guy playing Mal isn't sitting there looking at what a bunch of yahoos on an Internet message board decided Mal's issue should be, he's deciding what Mal's issue is for himself (edit) <b>WITH</b> back and forth from the rest of the group.  Which is as it should be, especially in PTA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62617/#Comment_62617" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-30T23:16:54+00:00" title="March 30, 2007 11:16PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think Chris has the way to go on this.

I have from the moment I saw it.<br/>Simon: I just don't want to die on it.<br/>Inara: [glancing away] I don't want to die at all.<br/><br/>implies that Inara may already be dying from some sort of terminal disease.  The syringe she was going to use in the pilot when passing by the Reaver ship?  It's a drug to kill her, so she wouldn't fall to the reavers while alive.  Why would she have this drug?  For when the pain of whatever is killing her is too great, she can slip out with some dignity.  <br/><br/>Then again at Objects in Space's opener, River was hearing lines from the other members of Serenity's crew.  Two thoughts on this -- she's hearing what they're feeling and going through right now or they're hearing things from their past.  Mal's "None of it means a damn thing" and Jayne's "I got stupid.  The money was too good." seem to point to the echoes of the past.  So Inara's "I'm a big girl, just tell me" line may not have been her wanting Mal to tell her to stay, it may have been her remembering getting the news from her doctor, which started her whole travelling in Serenity.  <br/><br/>Of course, you have to buy into the whole concept.  Honestly, there's more bits about Book's past in the show than there is to support the Inara dying theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyramon" title="Tyramon"><img alt="Tyramon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.imagedump.com/index.cgi?pick=get&amp;tp=495466"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyramon">Tyramon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62921/#Comment_62921" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T10:44:36+00:00" title="April  4, 2007 10:44AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2007 10:44AM by Tyramon.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game went smashingly well, although it did get off to a very rocky start with this situation:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: So Don what kinda Dice are we using for this game?

My own trouble spot wast that I think I may have been a bit harsh shushing people when they were <b>aggressivly</b> offering up options for me when we got to "River" parts of the game.<br/><br/>All in all it was an awesome game.  <i>Weak Zeke is up the creek.</i>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SabreCat</cite>I apologize if this is something of a tangent--let me know if I should put this in a different thread. In the past (not here) I've asked about "running [setting] using PTA," and received some pretty harsh criticism saying that's a poor way to go about it. I.e., the Pitch portion of PTA is an integral part of the game, and going in with a plan to run a particular genre or show upsets the vibe.</blockquote>\nFor this session, having a setting up front wasn't a problem at all.  Although, I've never played the game before so I guess I can't say whether we lost anything without a traditional Pitch portion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
