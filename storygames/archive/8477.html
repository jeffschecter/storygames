Here we talk about where we come from, how far we have gone from our dull start, and how rpg's helped us come this far. You may be as personal or general in your comment as you find appropriate yourself.<br/><br/><b>I will start out:</b><br/>Today I am an experienced GM and gamesmith. As a GM and designer I care for the players with less to play on than others; the inhibited and insecure players which are out of their depth when asked what their characters do in a role-playing game. A  lot of such players play with me, and play with others all over the world.<br/><br/>I ever strive to give them games where they may find the courage to lay their inhibitions aside and try out another way of being themselves.I try to give them what openings there is for simple and fulfilling interaction in my games, and hope that positive play-experiences will help them overcome some of their inhibitions.I know that a lot of passive, lonely and insecure people have had good use of rpg's in this respect.<br/><br/>I myself come from the camp of passive, lonely and insecure people originally. I had hell in primary- and high school, being hunted by co-pupils on a daily basis, and ignored by adults. I came into my adult life with stunted social antennas, a deeply rooted loneliness, no self-confidence, and a passive/hysterical twin-disorder making it virtually impossible for me to participate in a party or normal dinner amongst normal people.<br/><br/>It was hard for me to open up to the possibilities in rpg's, but a lot less hard than doing anything in real life. RPG's actually gave me a big chance to try out being included, and that chance turned into a lifelong and rewarding practice in this field. It has been rewarding in a lot of ways. I find myself outgoing, happily married, active and social in ways I had no reason to expect when I was 20 (I am 46 now). I still have miles to go, but life as I know it is happy.<br/><br/>RPG's has been an intrinsic part of my development. It has provided lots of opportunities to try out stuff in a secure setting, and has proved to be a "safe haven" from more demanding social intercources. The semi-ritualistic ways of the role-playing group have given me the chance to participate on almost equal footing with my co-players. That has been very good for me.<br/><br/><div><b>* * *</b></div><br/><br/>I have no need to romanticize the realities of being passive/lonely/socially inept. It sucks in any way you may perceive, and then some. I do not consider myself or others like me to be inferior humans, but I consider us to be at disadvantage in most social situations. I do, however, see that a lot of us have found some kind of havens in play groups around the world, perhaps due to them being so open for anyone, and due to them being based on a strictly formalized interactive practice that makes it easier for the socially inept of us.<br/><br/>So ...<br/><br/>Where do <b>you</b> come from? Are you or have you been lonely, passive or insecure yourself? How far have you gone from your dull start, and do you consider rpg's to have been of any help with your personal issues, directly and/or indirectly?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187876/#Comment_187876" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T16:30:27+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  4:30PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amen, brother.<br/><br/>RPGs have helped me out in my real life in several ways, but I think in no way greater than teaching me not to be conflict-avoidant.<br/><br/>I'm not as severely lacking in confidence or "normal" social skills as it sounds like you were as a teen / young adult.  I *am* physically disabled though, which, since it's such a huge mark against me, means I have to be even better than normal-looking people at socializing, persuading (...seducing?), etc.<br/><br/>The other dirty secret I harbor, and this is something I've only realized in recent years as I've gotten over being a lonely teen, is that I don't *enjoy* socializing with "normal people."  I, too, enjoy the structured-yet-social aspect of RPGs (and also boardgames), but if I'm going to do unstructured socializing, it had better be with nerds of some stripe if I'm not going to get bored!  (Not necessarily RPGers.  Music people, education people, and math people are OK too!  Though RPGers continue to form the core of my friends, and probably always will.  It's simply very central to my identity)<br/><br/>That said, because my basic social skills are pretty good, I'm willing to work with someone in a gaming group only if they are willing to meet me halfway.  Someone who is lonely and ill-adjusted and needs help?  I'm your man.  On the other hand, for example, I advocated very strongly for kicking someone out of the last D&amp;D group I was in\u2014that group was dysfunctional for a lot of reasons, but I stand by my plea to kick the guy.  He had extremely limited language skills, both spoken and written, and could not comprehend the rules of D&amp;D, neither on a purely mechanical level, nor on a social level (even in-game "social" stuff, like niche protection within the party).  He simply could not learn, or at least, not in that context, and he was a huge drag on the game.  A few months later, when he posted on a forum we're both on, asking for help with his social life and gaming, I PM'd him and (as gently as I could) suggested he get some speech and language therapy.  I don't know if he ever did.  I hope so.  He was a nice guy, and I didn't dislike him personally, but I did dislike having him in my game.<br/><br/>As a high school teacher, one of my major career goals is to start a gaming club at my school.  I imagine it will attract some social misfits, and I'm OK with that.  As a teacher I think I'll be able to guide the group's play in a socially healthy direction, in a way I wouldn't be able to if I was simply "some guy" (even if I was the GM).<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187881/#Comment_187881" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T16:45:52+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  4:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that RPGs taught me a lot. I was a shy, introverted kid who was never popular, and then, one day, I introduced a group of my friends to D&amp;D. Since it was my idea, they expected me to be the DM/GM.<br/><br/>Suddenly, I was thrust into a situation where I was a social organizer, moderator, leader, and I was the one who was bringing this group together and helping them have a good time. They looked to me to deliver a good time, arbitrate conflicts, and do things like making sure that the quiet folks didn't get overlooked, and they looked up to me for doing it well.<br/><br/>There is no question that the experience was transformative. I think I was 11--an important age for someone trying to figure out how what their place is in society. I learned to be more outgoing, comfortable with crowds, public speaking, and the like. I developed much higher self-esteem, in general, because a group of people was holding me responsible for a large part of their social life and fun, happy times. It was very empowering, and the experience, overall, helped me figure out how to be a functional, confident human being in an adult world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187886/#Comment_187886" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T16:55:35+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  4:55PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2009 5:06PM by JuddG.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I am not from the most severely effected of the group under discussion, I was awkward in High School (I think everyone was, but in differing ways - your High School clique seemed to be related to what in life you had managed to get your crap together in when you got there).  My experiences were similar to Paul's above (in almost every detail - GMs just grow up tough, I guess...[grin]).<br/><br/>What I can share is the experience of one of my players.<br/><br/>When I met my friend, he was down-trodden and meek.  He had a bad situation in practically every way I could conceive of, but he was a scrappy guy and he kept going somehow where I could not see myself doing so.  When we started playing, he would worry about each choice before him and would sometimes even go so far as to hide under his desk (as a learned reaction to stress) while he thought about what to do.<br/><br/>I have friendships with many people who are off the beaten track, so this didn't stop me from playing with him.  We kept playing and after almost a year, he was no longer hiding under the desk, he was speaking his mind.  He even went so far as to argue for his opinion, rather civilly and firmly,  with another member of the group who had previously been his "keeper" of sorts.  I could see the authority his character was gaining in play giving him a venue to try things and become more assertive.  I began throwing situations at him where he could oppose the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, and he would stand his ground more and more.<br/><br/>The major turning point for him was when some intrigues left the group in a position to play Kingmaker in a newly formed kingdom with powerful resources.  The "keeper" of this pal of mine used the opportunity to saddle my pal with the Crown.  I will never know for sure (and I have asked) if there was ill wishes or good behind that choice, but it galvanized my pal's spirit.<br/><br/>He rose to the challenge and fought to build and keep what was charged to him without fail.  He wasn't always winning or always ahead of the curve, but he was each and every time doing what was right without compromise.  I admired that, and as a GM I was glad to be part of the story of this leader.  I was also proud of him for another thing - he used his PC's power with great responsibility.  He was not a thug or bully, he didn't throw his weight around or do anything someone who gets a powerful alter ego sometimes does as a first time player.  He stuck to his guns and did the right thing with all his might - even when it cost him.  You have to admire that.<br/><br/>Nowadays, that pal of mine is not perfect, but he is empowered a bit my the games we play.  It lets him try things and test things.  He has an outlet for the words he wants to say where the backlash is not so real as it is elsewhere.  He still has quite a way to go, but the first few steps were right there in those games.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand that the game was some sort of directed therapy or that I had anything conscious to do with his improvement.  I was just in the right place at the right time.  It wasn't until well after he started "coming out of his shell" that I stopped to look back at the effect the game had on him.  I am glad I got to see it, though, because it showed me the power that these games can have.  I have always heard stories of athletes who found a positive avenue in life from their chosen sport or activity, and this is no different.  While my pal will never get his "Great Moments in Olympic History" style documentary filled with drama and fanfares, he is every bit as deserving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_187973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187973/#Comment_187973" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T22:46:52+00:00" title="January 12, 2009 10:46PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2009 10:55PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>I am glad I got to see it, though, because it showed me the power that these games can have.</blockquote>This is exactly what I am aiming at! Thanks for sharing! Thanks to all three of you! Interesting stories!<br/><br/>To your friends story, Judd; I once ran a group of six, five guys and a girl. They were youngsters, and the girl was one year younger than the others. She was rather timid too, and being placed with the BIG guys made her even more so, intially. The guys dimissed her mostly, but then I was given the chance to put those five thugs in jail. The girl, being too timid to follow their line of action, was the only one left free. So she had to free them ...<br/><br/>I must confess that I played a bit into her hands in that scenario, but with great effect. I told the guys it was a question of time before their characters would face the executioners axe. That made them a bit nervous (I were known for being a hardball GM). She made it, though, and freed them all! And they all hailed her as the great liberator! That surprised and gladdened her bigtime. "Did I do that?", she said; "but-but, then I am ... tough, then? I am tough!" And she smiled like nothing I have ever seen. She had tons of kudos for doing that in the game. Afterward the guys considered her one of the gang, and she transformed from timid to tough. One of the most empowering sessions I have ever had.<br/><br/><i>Role-power games?</i> ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
