Jason describes the Transforming Inhibitor as a covert agent working for the Invaders behind the scenes, a saboteur currently working as a celebrity trans-media figure, undermining the credibility of our heroes and inhibiting the education of the youth.  Orion suggests that the Moon itself is the Ancient Construct and Jason adds that the Invaders may have been biding their time for a million years inside their artificial satellite.  We theorize that they've been monitoring the planet's gas emissions, waiting for the humans to industrialize and pollute the atmosphere into a toxic smog breathable only by the aliens.  And perhaps they've been manipulating the development of mankind for ages, sending many Transforming Inhibitors to ensure their ecological suicide.<br/><br/>Tyler balances the moon-based Construct with an Inexplicable Guardian somehow associated with the Earth and connected to the Netherworldly Enigma.

Tyler proposes an impossible motorcycle jump over a flaming net.  Orion agrees and adds that he's recently lost so much fame due to Larb's character assassinations that he's ready to bet it all on one last unforgettable and probably fatal performance.  Morgo, disguised as a human and working as part of the stunt crew, urges him to reconsider.  He warns Good that no human could survive this and insists on secretly taking his place.  Convinced by the sudden revelation of Morgo's alien (and fireproof) nature, the stuntman hands over his costume and helmet.  Jason rolls enough hits to rescue Orion plus add one bonus die to the Transforming Inhibitor, and describes Morgo landing harmlessly in the burning net.  Orion suggests that the bonus die represents Larb's confusion over what just happened.<br/><br/>Flashback 2: Tyler outlines an earlier episode in which HEATH was mistaken for an obsolete fairground attraction and nearly dumped onto a scrapheap by a surly carnival worker named Carlos.  Good Knievel tries to convince Carlos to let him use the blocky robot to prop up his motorcycle ramp, takes offense at the carnie's insulting attitude and gets knocked down in the resulting fistfight.  A crowd of fans witnesses the altercation and rushes to Good's side, rescuing both him and HEATH but provoking the "Wrath of the Carnival Workers' Union" (a 2d4 Complication). <br/><br/>Flashback 3: In a later scene, while investigating Enigmatic emanations at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, Zantar and HEATH discovered a strange portal into the Netherworldly caverns below.  HEATH saves Zantar from falling into a chasm but rolls enough danger to generate another Complication.  Jason suggests that opening the portal released etheric vibrations detectable on the Moon and the Invaders have realized that we're close to reaching the Inexplicable Guardian.  The "Invader Plan Speeds Up" accordingly.<br/><br/>Flashback 4: In our last episode, Morgo defected from the Lunar Invaders and contacted his childhood heroes, the Danger Patrol (a governmental anti-alien task force), to inform them of the imminent attack.  Zantar accompanies him to their headquarters in Los Alamos and vouches for the truth of his words.  We quickly learn that disguised Moon-Men have infiltrated and taken control of the Danger Patrol, using their substantial resources to conceal all evidence of the impending invasion.  Tyler portrays the too-friendly Director of the Patrol who attempts to trap, drug and kill our heroes before they can expose the nefarious scheme.  Just as all seems lost, Zantar mesmerizes everyone in the room and whisks the confused Morgo to safety, also adding three bonus dice to the Lunar Invaders card representing our new and better understanding of the devious Moon-Man plan.  Yet another Complication is generated, the "Danger Patrol Infiltration" in which Morgo still refuses to believe.<br/><br/>At the end of the flashback round, we added one more Complication to the table in order to establish a better connection between the two least developed Threats.  Orion points to the Guardian and Construct, proposing that they arrived eons ago from outer space and somehow oppose each other.  The Lunar Invaders have somehow managed to awaken and harness the implacable power of the Construct, but its conflict with the Guardian is resulting in a "Tidal Force Overload" of tsunamis and volcanic explosions.<br/><br/>End of Round, Threats vs. Earth: The Lunar Invaders and Ancient Construct both hit and Earth checks off two of its six boxes.  Orion narrates the opening scene of this final episode, with a Danger Patrol base on the Moon measuring underground vibrations and a group of rockets flying around it to investigate the strange readings.  The lunar surface suddenly shifts, a giant eye opens and a booming voice audible all the way to Earth says, "You annoy me."  As a huge laser burns the rockets from the sky, Tyler describes a frantic moonbase cadet reporting the attack to his captain, only to be shot dead by yet another Moon-Man spy.<br/><br/>Cut to black, cue theme song and montage of our heroes in action with freeze-frames and credits, cue Danger Patrol logo, commercial.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich" title="Seth_Magdich"><img alt="Seth_Magdich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich">Seth_Magdich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451854/#Comment_451854" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-15T04:43:24+00:00" title="March 15, 2016  4:43AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2016 4:44AM by Seth_Magdich.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Turn 1: We agree that Larb Bontus the Transforming Inhibitor must be exposed live on the air, and Tyler believes that Zantar's strange powers are the key to uncovering the alien lies.  Morgo, HEATH and Zantar stride into his customized news studio on the 190th floor of a downtown New York skyscraper and confront the pundit in front of his adoring audience.  Politely deflecting Larb's boorishness and rabble-rousing, Zantar gestures hypnotically, dispels the effects of the Disguiser Ray and reveals the true form of the Moon-Man saboteur!  HEATH quickly uses his Radar Antennae to broadcast the image of the stick-thin bright-red spidery alien to every television in the city.  Too late, Larb activates his Calcinator Ray and turns to ash before the public's eyes.  Orion suggests a quick cover-up in the media and we see Danger Patrol scientists appear on every news station to debunk Zantar's obvious trickery.  Nine hits means a Complication is also taken out and we agree that "Invader Plan Speeds Up" is no longer true due to our heroic interference.<br/><br/>Turn 2: In another quick flashback, we return to our heroes' earlier confrontation with the Netherworldly Enigma.  Descending into the caverns beneath the Grand Canyon, they encounter a bizarre low-gravity landscape of lunar fungus and inexplicably cratered moondust.  Wild speculation ensues regarding the origin of this underground anomaly as well as that of the Grand Canyon itself.  Jason warns us that a lost tribe of degenerate Moon-Men might jump out and attack us with spears at any moment, and we quickly agree that we've all been captured, bound to poles and taken to meet the tribal leader.  The "High Calcinator" gestures to HEATH as several large glowing stones rise from the earth, each bearing an alien heiroglyph.  If the robot cannot solve the Great Riddle, we shall all be thrown to the Magma Beasts.  Morgo quickly interprets the semi-familiar symbols and Zantar relays the translation to HEATH via their Empathic Link.  Tyler describes strange energies engulfing and corroding his iron fists as he touches each in turn.  As the final stone descends back into the ground, the tribe begins to chant and the earth begins to quake.  The Enigma is defeated but HEATH takes 2d4 as the lingering Enigmatic energies short-circuit and interfere with his Power Core.  A new Complication is also generated and Orion suggests that the Magma Beasts are now erupting out onto city streets.  We're still unclear about the connection between (and the intentions of) the lost tribe, the Magma Beasts and the Inexplicable Guardian, but agree to defer those questions until later.<br/><br/>(My theory was that the tribal leader was following a prophecy which foretold an iron giant reuniting the lost Moon-tribes by solving the Great Riddle.  Maybe he knew that the giant would thereby activate and absorb the Guardian's Inexplicable Enigmatic energies, then travel to the alienated Construct and reestablish their broken connection through the power of Cyber-Quantum Oscillation.)<br/><br/>Turn 3: Returning to the present, our heroes narrowly escape Larb Bontus' studio and the pursuing Danger Patrol by stealing a rocketship and blasting off to the Moon.  Tyler describes the warmongering "Chief Calcinator" addressing the Lunar Senate and reporting on the progress of the invasion when suddenly the door bursts open!  Morgo interrupts the alien leader and delivers a passionate speech decrying the needless antagonism and beseeching the senators to end the hostilities.  He warns them that the Construct beneath the Moon and the Guardian under the Earth will destroy everyone unless they can find a way to work together.  We agree that there's a danger that snipers may be hiding in the wings, and also that a Danger Patrol spy may have stowed away aboard our stolen rocketship and followed us all the way to the senate chamber.  Jason rolls 5 hits and 5 danger.  Morgo has nearly persuaded the senators to veto the invasion when a gunshot rings out and he falls to an unseen assassin (Shot Through the Heart, 2d4).<br/><br/>Turn 4: Orion describes Good Knievel's shock at Morgo's apparent death, and his anguish over seeing his own picture inside Morgo's fallen locket.  Revving his somehow-moonworthy motorcycle and activating his Jump Jets, Good hurtles off the edge of a senator's desk, shatters the chamber's crystalline pillars and crashes into the assassin, revealing him to be the Director of the Patrol himself.  Orion rolls nine hits and takes out both the Lunar Invaders and the Danger Patrol Infiltration by KO'ing the Director, finishing Morgo's speech and convincing the senators that the invasion must be stopped.  Tyler depicts the cowardly Chief Calcinator escaping to his executive office, quickly packing a suitcase and stuffing his pockets full of lunar cash.  He flees down a hallway, turns the wrong corner and suddenly gets run down by Good Knievel.<br/><br/>End of Round, Threats vs. Earth: The Inexplicable Guardian and Ancient Construct hit, leaving Earth with only two boxes remaining.  Orion describes the Construct fully awakening (due to the destruction of the crystalline command chamber?) and freeing itself from the control of the Moon-Men, then contacting the Guardian and offering to join forces to destroy the vermin who have infested their surfaces for so long.  The worlds shake with Tidal Force Overload as the Moon moves inexorably closer and closer to the Earth.  The Guardian seems OK with this, but its intentions are still unclear.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich" title="Seth_Magdich"><img alt="Seth_Magdich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich">Seth_Magdich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451855/#Comment_451855" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-15T04:44:00+00:00" title="March 15, 2016  4:44AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Turn 5: We were nearly at the end of our 3-hour timeslot, so we decided to combine the Guardian and Construct into one final 12-hit Threat.  Orion characterizes the Construct, sitting lonely and alone in cold space, consumed with jealousy over the friendship and happiness it sees in the people of Earth and driven to destroy them out of spite.  He suspects that we may be able to defeat that loneliness by making friends with it.  Tyler narrates the heroes racing from the broken remains of the Senate chamber across the lunar surface to the Construct's giant "eye," actually a massive artificial crater where its central mainframe resides.  He adds that Carlos and his crew of carnies also stowed away aboard the stolen rocketship and have now emerged to prevent the heroes from reaching the eye.  Orion suggests that the carnies are all, and have always been, poorly disguised Moon-Men.  HEATH fights through the carnies, reaches the mainframe and opens the hatch on his radiant Power Core since "the only way he knows how to share love is to share energy."  Unfortunately (or was it prophecy?), Tyler rolls only 8 hits and 5 danger, the 2d4 of lingering Enigma-related energies disrupting the flow and blasting the robot back fifty feet in a massive power surge.  The carnies seize the opportunity to renew their attack, kicking and bashing the stunned HEATH, while the mainframe powers up its laser cannons for a new "Construct Defenses" Complication.<br/><br/>Turn 6: Good Knievel drives circles around the mainframe, weaving his motorcycle between the laser blasts.  Jason reveals that Morgo is still alive (due to a secondary heart), and he quickly activates his Strange Device to give Orion one last bonus die.  Using the Cyber-Quantum Oscillating Field d8 to magnify his voice, he pleads with the Guardian and Construct to come to a peaceful resolution and recognize the value of both humanity and Moon-Manity.  Orion rolls 15 hits and 2 danger, and Good Knievel launches his motorcycle off of a moon-dune into the eye of the Construct.  He explains that he'd recently replaced his engine with a prototype power core similar to HEATH's, and that strange energy was now resonating through the Oscillating Field, connecting HEATH's heart to the Construct, the Guardian and the motorcycle in an epiphany of compassion and love for all things.  The Moon drops its weapons and the Magma Beasts cool down to become beautiful statues speaking with the Guardian's voice, delivering words of wisdom and encouraging unity and brotherhood for all peoples.  The Earth and Moon move back into peaceful orbits and the day is saved.<br/><br/>Epilogue:  All is forgiven and Moon-Men now coexist with humans on Earth.  The Lunar Senate offers Morgo the position of "Grand Calcinator" but he turns it down to become the new Administrator of the reformed Danger Patrol.  HEATH enlists as a part-time Patroller and also gets a day job as a counselor.  Orion suggests that Good Knievel's motorcycle now speaks with the voice of the Inexplicable Guardian, occasionally giving them missions, while HEATH kept his link to the Moon and acts as its ambassador / therapist.  We end with our heroes rushing to the scene of an "intolerance alert" to investigate a report of human-alien discrimination.  We all turn to the camera and Good Knievel says, "Remember kids, be kind to others!"  Freeze frame, cue music, credits.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
