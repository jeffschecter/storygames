I said \u201cThat\u2019s probably not so easy\u2026 I don\u2019t think you can do it\u201d and between sessions I looked it up and texted with them today. We use ACKS for the economy including magical research &amp; hiring alchemists, there are 1d3 alchemists for hire in Hawa, it\u2019d take them 24 weeks + 12000 dinars for every attempt (30% chance) to create the recipe and once they have the recipe, it\u2019ll take them 12 weeks + 6000 dinars + 6000 xp worth of monster blood for every attempt (45% chance) to brew one flask.</p>\n<p>So, probably a couple of years of them paying 500 dinars per week (which is more than what they own right now) and some monster blood. And they said that they might want to embark on that as a long term goal.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t an endorsement of ACKS specifically (I usually say \u201cthe important thing is that there <em>is</em> a rule, not <em>what</em> the rule is\u201d). For the purposes of what I\u2019m going to say, the rule could\u2019ve just as well said it\u2019d taken two months and cost 50 dinars, or anything else.</p>\n<p>Had we played Hillfolk [we do use Dramasystem, but, in conjunction with various D&amp;D rulesets] or Microscope or Fiasco the question would\u2019ve been adjudicated in a much different way. For example, consulting a card, the palette, or a die color. The primary issue would\u2019ve been \u201cwill this make for a good story, will this address the premise\u201d etc. Which is cool too. We would\u2019ve found an answer right away instead of me spending a couple of hours trying to understand the ACKS text (it\u2019s a treasure trove that has answers to most questions, but it\u2019s, due to its denseness, opaquer than consulting the I Ching).</p>\n<p>Also look at it this way:</p>\n<p>If we were playing Brooklyn cops in the 1970:s and a player would\u2019ve asked for an alchemist to brew a custom potion, the answer would\u2019ve been no. (I mean I probably would\u2019ve said yes. Don\u2019t know how to make this point really.)</p>\nI guess what I'm trying to say that I would've probably said "yes, here you go".\n<p>Instead, here, \u201cYes, it\u2019s possible, it takes a couple of years and lots of money\u201d.</p>\n<p>Another thing that happened was that a player killed an NPC accidentally. The <a href="https://open5e.com/combat/damage-and-healing.html#knocking-a-creature-out" rel="nofollow">rule</a>, and we did a refresher just before, is that when someone reaches zero HP, you can decide then and there that you were only subduing &amp; capturing them, not killing them. <strong>But it doesn\u2019t work for ranged, <em>only</em> m\xeal\xe9e.</strong> (The attack of the last type is what matters.) But even though we had just gone through it moments before, the player forgot and then shot an arrow at the NPC (who were running away). So they died.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s also possible in some games with partials like AW or Blades. But in vanilla Hillfolk, it can\u2019t really happen easily. You set up obstacles and draw cards to see if you can overcome them.</p>\n<p>These sort of unexpected events, some story games do very well too. But they\u2019re part of the \u201cconsequence engine\u201d\u2013layer of the game.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t me trying to say that one or the other style is better. I\u2019m trying to think about my campaign\u2026 which is a drama game (Dramasystem) on top of a procedural game (D&amp;D).</p>\n<p>We set scenes as per Hillfolk and that\u2019s where most of our play is. We go to Azira\u2019s opium den or the Inn of the Billowing Sails or to the mosque of Najm or are out on the open sea, and we look at the precedence card to see who\u2019s turn it is to set the scene. When and where are you, and who are you with? If you do a time skip or a location shift, that can trigger procedural mechanics such as encounter checks, cost-of-living rolls, navigation checks etc. I was concerned this was going to kill the drama (obv I went ahead and tried the campaign anyway). But\u2026 it <em>grounds</em> the drama. I like the mix a lot so far.</p>\n<p><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow">In Ben\u2019s terminology</a>, everyone\u2019s limited to the world using only their own character, just like in an adventure game. You control one character, and that\u2019s it. That's your interface to the game. It\u2019s physical, it\u2019s difficult to do things, even though we\u2019re in a world of magic and djinni. But big parts of what drives play are story-game concerns, including interface affordances like the scene setting, the \u201cwhat do I want and why can\u2019t I have it\u201d-setup, and the drama tokens.</p>\n<p>Everyone has two character sheet, a Hillfolk character sheet (I modded it to remove the skill ranks) and a D&amp;D character sheet.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464063/#Comment_464063" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T09:47:36+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  9:47AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm acting like I'm this super DM but all I did was come up with the idea to mix D&amp;D and Hillfolk.

Does a player's "in-character role" influence on the game apply only *within* scenes, or are they also limited in similar ways outside of scenes?<br/><br/>I've long been fascinated by the idea of using "trad" game mechanics with an enlightened group of story gamers, but never actually made it happen. (Once, I participated in a campaign which did this, but it had all kinds of problems - it will be interesting to see if any of them rear their heads in your game, as well, or not.)<br/><br/>I think that the various *World games come pretty close to this style of play, for people who play them with a strong commitment to the integrity of the world &amp; fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464096/#Comment_464096" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-16T19:16:52+00:00" title="June 16, 2017  7:16PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Create and portray their own player characters.

Before the scene starts. Instead of going to all locations, searching.<br/>Those have been the three things. They haven't introduced elements. They also all help with execution of 'dice' elements, like rolling fishing rolls for 17 NPC bahriyin.<br/><br/>The big difference is intent when "driving" your PC. Soft, careful and plentiful stance transitions. Going between author, pawn, identifying. Thinking in the one moment "It would make cool drama if I\u2026" and in another moment letting your identification with the character drive.<br/><br/>Like in Robbin's example, the paladin who takes of their armor because they trust in their faith.

I.e. procedural stuff. And that's not a problem in and of itself. It's like having a healthy solid meal and an unusual and interesting dessert both on the table at once, when you can only eat so much.  It feels weird.<br/><br/>We went from a game (Curse of Strahd) that was 60% exploration, 20% drama vs npcs, 20% fighting, to a game that's 20% exploration, 20% drama vs npcs, 50% drama vs each other, 10% fighting. And, I mean, that's a good thing, the new mix works well, but getting used to the new mix takes some time.<br/><br/>That's the first thing that came to mind.<br/><br/>Second thing is that they engage with the NPCs a lot, which I love, that's the part of D&amp;D I really appreciate the most as a DM, but I'm concerned it comes at the expense of drama vs each other. The NPCs are so cool and a big part of the appeal of the game. But, the PCs are supposed to be the main cast.<br/><br/>Third, sometimes they make choices that go against what the player wants and what the character wants, just to stay together. For example, one of them is the local priest of Jisan. She joined the pirates' treasure hunt just so the group could be in one place even though she also wanted to grow her power base in Hawa and protect her flock against a violent rival organisation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464112/#Comment_464112" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-17T05:00:32+00:00" title="June 17, 2017  5:00AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting exercise, to list challenges and issues with what's only the best game of all time.

Well, that's the dream, isn't it? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I only see the snippets you've posted here, but my armchair guess - my impression at a distance - is that the game has a bunch of really enthusiastic players who are all engaging with it 110% and meeting in a creative place which is exciting to everyone.<br/><br/>That's a great experience!<br/><br/>But I'm curious what role the System is playing in that. Sometimes, a group of skilled and enthusiastic players can be all you need for the best gaming in the world. But how are the very choices you made about setting up the rules at work contributing (or not)?<br/><br/>Can you tease out which parts are human inventiveness, skill, and happy chemistry? And which are a direct result of the procedures and rules you've decided to implement here?<br/><br/>Perhaps, taken another way, how do you think the game would look different if you were to change some of the rulesets in this "mixtape"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464204/#Comment_464204" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-20T05:39:32+00:00" title="June 20, 2017  5:39AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2017 4:36AM by 2097.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The original idea was that by imposing these three overlapping, restrictive frameworks<br/><br/>\u2022 Dramasystem relationships, desires, DPs, needs and scenes<br/>\u2022 D&amp;D consequence engine<br/>\u2022 Setting adherence<br/><br/>it'd be so difficult to even play that you kinda <i>have</i> to bring your A game. "Restrictions breed creativity". But, remember, that some of the awesomest contributions have come from people who have never played any RPG or story game before. We've had three completely new people and put them on the spot and they've delivered.<br/><br/>So, switching out components in the mixtape\u2026<br/>I'll do reverse order.<br/><br/>1a. This particular setting. It's a setting very different from our everyday life here, but where a short pitch gets you a long way to understanding it ("A Thousand and One Nights with elves and orcs"). It's a setting that has a lot of detail over a large geographic area but no time span or time line. It's a closed set \u2014 ten boxes, three books, no meta plot. It's a setting with lots of language and customs and clothing detail (and, above all, religion, which is a huge part of the game). It's a setting that's politically appealing. It's a setting with lots of crossover potential \u2014 people can come from all over al-Toril or even other planets and planes. There are portals to/from Earth also. It's a very appealing set up with a chaotic city vs a lawful city. Also, one book ("The Adventurer's Guide to Zakhara") happens to be very well organized. All those things I think favor the game. But\u2026 I kinda think this rules mix would work with other settings well, too. I'm going to apply Dramasystem to my next campaign, too, provided I can get the player count.<br/><br/>1b. Setting adherence in general. I'm thinking perhaps that it's less that setting adherence is what makes the game work, and more that something in how the game is set up encourages buy-in and setting adherence. Will have to observe more.<br/><br/>2. D&amp;D. 2a. Task-level resolution is important because the rules are "the guns on the table". You don't pick them up on a scene-by-scene level, you only pick them up for that one thing. But there are other simple systems that could work just as well (Fudge, perhaps?). 2b. All the other subsystems like rules for "How many healing potions are on sale in Hawa this month?". Good rules for things like this isn't easy to come by anymore since the Age of Sim is so long gone. ACKS is a pretty good start. 2c. Compability with a cornucopia of OSR, TSR, WotC, d20 and 5e material means a lot less work for me. I can grab a dungeon and plop it down there. 2d. The fact that a couple of players have been sticking with it for three years makes it almost primal. It has been the physics for so many games before. Like, when we were playing Microscope the other day, the players were like "I want to Require a guy who can cast meteor shower\u2026 but would it make sense that such a high-level sorcerer would be present?" etc. It's so ingrained, and there's a magic in that. 2e. The brand recognition of D&amp;D might come in handy down the road to pitch the game to new players locally. 2, summary: It might work well with other settings and games, too. The magic is:<br/><br/>3. Dramasystem. There's nothing like it. Unlike Fiasco, it's built for campaigns. And, 90% of the time, scenes are coming to their natural end. You play things out, and then judge them retroactively, instead of steering things with dice color. The 2dt push is an exception, not the norm (but the threat of it is always there, which affects play). But the most useful tool has been the precedence cards. This is present in Fiasco and Microscope and Remember Tomorrow and well, <i>most</i> story games, too. (Well, not cards always, but the concept of "Now it's your turn to frame".) But those games are often built for shorter campaigns, smaller groups, and fewer opportunities to immerse, compared to Dramasystem.<br/><br/><br/>I'd say that a typical story game has a much lighter touch in all three of these areas. This is like industrial-strength. Blades and Burning Empires comes close: detailed setting with lots of factions, rules for subsystems such an "can I buy/sell this-or-that? can my crew gain in power?", story-game-like framing. It's just that I've added all the magic of 40 years of D&amp;D\u2026?! + a need for the players to get up in <i>each others</i> grill, not just the Eels / the Vaylens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464259/#Comment_464259" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-24T01:45:16+00:00" title="June 24, 2017  1:45AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Industrial strength" is a great metaphor for what you've got going on here.<br/><br/>I love the ambitious scope of the project, and it seems that having presented it as such has led to a different sort of intensity from the players. <br/><br/>There's probably something to be said for "setting the bar high", in terms of setting up expectations (and/or possibly driving away players not willing to deal with such a hardcore approach).

And, for economy, we\u2019re gradually introducing the more detailed system in ACKS.</p>\n<p>One thing all of these rules have in common is that they\u2019re all pretty much directly triggered by things in the SIS.

You go on a journey: encumbrance becomes relevant.)</p>\n<p>In vanilla Hillfolk, you typically call a procedural scene and act it out using the playing card system. But here, any procedural element are hooked in when the mimetodiegetic act triggers them. Typically every, hmm, seventh scene or so there\u2019s some of this? Or thereabouts? All of these rules are fiction-first. They might not be fiction <em>last</em> (for example, a \u201cslot\u201d, an \u201cHP\u201d and an \u201cXP\u201d are abstractions, but the rules that govern gaining or losing them are triggered from the fiction.).</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>do you some how find ways to get them to tie into what\u2019s happening?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Here are some things that have happened:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the waterways under the city investigating a cult tied to a PC, stumbling over some sleeping people in cult robes.

And, in vanilla Hillfolk, you can\u2019t kill other PCs. You can in a procedural scene but in Hillfolk, even convincing someone to play chess with you is considered procedural since playing chess isn\u2019t inherently an emotional exchange \u2014 you want a practical outcome (them dead) by convincing them to do a practical thing (sit focused at a game with their back unguarded). So you\u2019d use the playing card procedural system for the whole thing.</p>\n<p>But, in D&amp;Dfolk, the \u201cconvincing\u201d would be done by talking. It\u2019d be a mixed dramatic/procedural scene instead of a wholly procedural scene.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>However, in D&amp;D (especially in higher-level D&amp;D), that wouldn\u2019t work.

All of these rolls are quick and done without any discussion. It\u2019d sound like this:</p>\n<p>If sitter is NPC:</p>\nPlayer: \u201cI try to step behind them, unnoticed.\u201d<br/>DM: \u201cOK, DC 12\u201d.<br/>Player: \u201cI slit their throats.\u201d<br/>DM: \u201cOK, AC 13.\u201d<br/>Player: \u201c15 damage.\u201d<br/>DM: \u201cStill alive\u201d<br/>Player: \u201cI rehide, I want to remain behind them.\u201d<br/>DM: \u201cOK, DC 12. You can go again since you got a surprise round.\u201d<br/>Player: \u201cAnd then they had AC\u2026 13?\u201d<br/>DM: \u201cYes, AC 13.\u201d<br/>Player: \u201c15 damage.\u201d<br/>DM: \u201cOK, they\u2019re dead\u201d.\n<p>So, a lot of dice talk (rolling dice over numbers adding numbers to lower numbers) but never any arrows talk. What rule the SIS prompted you to engage was clear and the consequences of the dice action were clear.</p>\n<p>Part of this is because D&amp;D is so familiar. If we played Blades or vanilla Hillfok for three years we would\u2019ve been as fast with their systems.</p>\n<p>Again, any HP remaining means that they\u2019re well &amp; healthy, but a week of rest will shake off any remaining stress, fatigue, bad destiny etc. You get consequential physical damage only when you roll on the Lingering Injuries table (at 0 hp \u2014 if you survive the death saves).</p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s interesting to me. Any \u201caction\u201d rules are tightly tied to the SIS. Sneaking triggers Stealth checks, acting violently towards someone triggers Attack rolls.</p>\n<p>The meta resources (HP, XP, and slots) are the opposite, they\u2019re extremely <em>loosely</em> tied to the SIS. But\u2026 players tend to fear for their character\u2019s life when the character has low HP. It\u2019s almost magical how that works. HP is your vague ability to be alive, XP is your vague ability to wield procedural/practical might, slots are your vague ability to use magic.</p>\n<p>But in dice &amp; cloud terms, it\u2019s very appropriate that the rules have this division. You never interact with \u201cthe variables\u201d (HP, XP, slots) directly, they\u2019re always (in functional programming terms) \u201cside effects\u201d of the procedures \u201chide\u201d, \u201cattack\u201d etc.</p>\n<p>You do something in the SIS, you go to a \u2018dice\u2019 function (Stealth check), you get a y/n result, you go back to the SIS. Some functions have side effects: gaining or losing HP, XP or slots. Some questions have no direct function (there\u2019s no \u201cCan I kill them? y/n\u201d \u2013 there\u2019s only \u201cCan I <em>attack</em> them? y/n\u201d). The variables have triggers associated with certain states. (If you have no slots, you can\u2019t magic. If you have a lot of XP, you get stronger. If you have no HP, you can\u2019t live.)</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why the rule for <a href="https://open5e.com/combat/damage-and-healing.html#knocking-a-creature-out" rel="nofollow">just capturing someone without killing them</a> is so genius and also use HP. Because HP, as a variable, doesn\u2019t have to mean anything in particular; it\u2019s just a pacing mechanism for the functions. It\u2019s a counter that measuers how many times you\u2019ve successfully \u201cattacked\u201d, and the extent of the successes of those attacks, and that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve written extensively in Swedish about this concept of abstract \u201cextracted variables\u201d (i.e.\xa0HP/xp/slots/clock ticks/stress track/Harm/barter/Hx) vs concrete function output (the \u201cy/n\u201d part).</p>\n<p>This is also how a rogue has a lot easier time doing that chess murder because they have so high damage output. A fighter has less output per attack but gets a lot more attacks per round and that would result in the chess murder being done differently. You could still do it (a level 5 fighter using both action surge and the surprise round from stealth could get six attacks in before the sitter could react) but it\u2019d be a barrage of small hits <small>(threats? physical stabbing? fencing? insults? \u2014 don\u2019t know which, don\u2019t need to know which, can easily find out which when we <em>do</em> really want to know)</small> rather than two big hits.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>What?

Just like how in vanilla Hillfolk you can\u2019t die at all, in D&amp;D there are some rules to how you die. Especially in the ACKS world, the more levels you have the more practical power you have \u2014 i.e.\xa0kings and rulers have more Fighter levels than townsfolk.</p>\n<p>The cleric tried to stab someone (who was sleeping) in the throat. D&amp;D 5e has rules for when you try to kill someone in their sleep, we used those rules, and the cleric didn\u2019t put a single scratch on the sleeper, who instead woke up. (I talked to the cleric\u2019s player later, who I invited because they have a lot more story game experience than D&amp;D experience, and they said it made sense, that they were kinda glad that the sleeper didn\u2019t die. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019m trying to report frankly on the game here, rather than paint things rose-tintedly.)</p>\n<p>Later, the rogue tried to capture someone (who was writing) without killing them. But, they tried to flee, so the rogue instead shot them. And, I mentioned the NPC Kashma, who was killed by someone [an NPC with Fighter levels] in cult robes.</p>\n<p>In all three cases, HP determined life or death.</p>\n<p>The old man could hire a better killer, use spells, potions, poisons, a trap. We\u2019re in a 2e city so there is \u201csave or die\u201d poison they can get.</p>\n<p>Let me be explicit. <strong>HP, as an abstraction, breaks \u201cto do it, do it\u201d sometimes.</strong> I value \u201cto do it, do it\u201d very very much but HP has so many advantages. So far, I\u2019m thinking HP is worth it (but, I\u2019m still testing \u2014 and trying to have an open mind about my own game play).</p>\n<p>Most games (perhaps because of D&amp;D\u2019s long shadow) have some sort of life-or-death abstraction going on. Fate, stress track. Blades, harm levels on you, clock ticks on NPCs. Kult, wound levels.</p>\n<p>Everway and Cthulhu Dark comes up as obvious counterexamples. There, you can \u201cjust die\u201d as part of action resolution. Those games have other clocks going on (Fate card in Everway, Insight in Cthulhu Dark) though, because there are other things the game wants to pace out.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>In my experience with D&amp;D, these situations come up ALL the time: something is a natural and intuitive action in the game (\u201cThis guy is too strong for me to fight, so I\u2019ll trick him into thinking he\u2019s my ally and stab him in the back\u201d) but the rules don\u2019t make it an effective move to take.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, and that\u2019s by design.

If you roleplay and give in, you get tokens. If you try to resist, HP will measure out the success or failure of that resistance.</p>\n<p>In AW terms, you roll when you Go Aggro. Here, just introducing violence, if the other party don\u2019t immediately give (which, again, might happen b/c they want tokens), you go to dice. Perhaps the entire battle takes place in a second, with that crossbow never leaving the persons back in the fiction, but in the mechanics there are a couple of rolls back and forth, HP goes down, and finally someone gives up (or dies).</p>\n<p>The fight becomes all \u201cdice talk\u201d, you leave the SIS, but, wherever you stop the dice, you have something that makes sense in the SIS. Maybe the threatener is the one that gets subdued, maybe you are.</p>\n<p>As I\u2019ve conceded previously, and perhaps it\u2019s time for a houserule re this, <strong>Ammo [crossbow bolts etc] is a big counter-argument to my \u201cHP as an abstraction\u201d model.</strong> I\u2019ll try that out next session, make a rule \u201cthreaten\u201d where you do attack rolls and HP loss as per normal, but don\u2019t scratch arrows, when you\u2019re in a close enough position to just threaten with the bow. Or, I\u2019ll ask the group about it.</p>\nAlso, HP is very expensive. You might give in just to conserve HP.<br/><br/>We actually have an example from our last session. Jayani (NPC) put her sword to Tarala's (PC) throat, and Tarala gave in without any rolls. Not to conserve HP, but because it made sense to her, mimetically (and she got tokens for it, too).\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>Similarly with the rules for ability use (I\u2019m referring to things which are useable \u201conce per day\u201d or \u201conce per encounter\u201d or whatever) and healing: I got the impression that, with scene framing abilities, you wouldn\u2019t be tracking time spent constantly, but all of these D&amp;Disms rely on keeping a \u201cclock\u201d constantly.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>We are definitely keeping careful track of time and rests etc. We need it for diegetic things also, like how long you are salt bonded to someone after sharing a meal with them, how much money you are spending on food and drink and rent in the city etc. (We handle most of this [living expenses etc] monthly, some of this daily, some of this hourly.)</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>Or do you just accept the extra overhead of tracking all kinds of things that might not be relevant (like equipment), just to allow for the possibility of moments where they could be?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>It is relevant because it\u2019s part of the characters lives.

I definitely considered the experiment a success at this point. I thought this was very satisifying as it was. However, I was concerned that the drama would peter out over time and it\u2019d become all procedural, if we lost the scene framing. <em>A concern not based on anything that had happened in this campaign yet</em>, just a pre-emptive concern. I\u2019d say the second half was about half procedural, half drama, but mixed together. (So total 1/4 of the session procedural, 3/4 of the session drama.)</li>\n<li>Fourth session: back to scenes\u2026 mostly. We weren\u2019t full group so this was about half procedural, half drama too.</li>\n<li>Fifth session: even better at keeping to the sceens and we did it wholly again. This one, every scene was mostly drama even though procedural things happened in the background too. They went on a long journey but there were plenty of dramatic exchanges on the journey. There was a dramatic exchange between Tarala (PC) and Jayani (NPC) but a minor procedural fallout (Jayani dumped a rolled up carpet containing an interesting package on Tarala\u2019s floor and said \u201cTake care of this\u201d) had a lot of dramatic fallout since the carpet contained a person, another NPC.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>For instance, if you go into a dungeon, do you play it out in D&amp;D-style, or do you still \u201cframe scenes\u201d (\u201cOk, so let\u2019s skip ahead. [\u2026]</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>OK, this has been underdocumented so I\u2019ll try to untangle this. Followup-questions especially welcome here.</p>\n<p>So we use a system (this is straight up from Hillfolk) where everyone\u2019s name is on a card and those cards are shuffled and then laid out in a row and we take turns following that order. When your turn comes up, you\u2019re the protagonist.</p>\n<p>You decide who you want in the scene. People have to pay if they\u2019ve been invited but don\u2019t want to be there or pay if they\u2019ve been uninvited but want to be there. (They can just ask, and if you say \u201cyes, you\u2019re welcome\u201d, then no need to pay.)</p>\n<p>So if you\u2019re all in the dungeon together, maybe you take someone aside. Maybe you whisper.</p>\n<p>You can frame scenes without a time skip. The one concession we make is \u201cWhere can I find you? Or do you come to me?\u201d [when that makes reasonable sense]. \u201cI\u2019m at the Najm mosque, praying\u201d is perhaps a common answer, or \u201cI\u2019m at the Inn of the Billowing Sails, drinking\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m at our warehouse, scrubbing the blood from the floor\u201d. You can hide from the scene \u201cYou don\u2019t know where I am\u201d but it costs a token.</p>\n<p>You can request a time skip. <strong>Time skips in the city</strong> happen a lot. We skip forward a couple of hours. Or a week if people want slots back.</p>\n<p>A <strong>time skip on a long journey</strong> really makes sense. <em>But</em>. It\u2019s more of a fast forward. \u201cOK, let\u2019s make fishing rolls for the crew, scratch water for everyone, and make six encounter checks.\u201d If a Reef Giant shows up and tries to wreck the ship, that\u2019s immediate grounds for a procedural scene. Also, players can challenge the time skip (as per Hillfolk). \u201cWait, don\u2019t time skip the boat journey, I really want to say something to you while we\u2019re alone on the boat. I love you, Yufar! Please give me another chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>A <strong>time skip in the dungeon</strong> we don\u2019t do. You can wait out time (\u201cWe bar the doors and then wait in this room for about an hour.\u201d) and there are rules for that (\u201cOK, make three encounter checks.\u201d) and that happens often enough. But we don\u2019t jump over prodecural things that have happened in the dungeon. When you frame your scene, if you are in the dungeon, you\u2019re expected to do so where the last scene left off. (There\u2019s still plenty of things you can do within that restriction. Or, you can sometimes leave \u2013 leaving usually is quicker because you\u2019re going through already-explored rooms \u2013 before your scene starts up for real.) If you chose to do procedural things (like continuing to explore the dungeon) we\u2019ve decided on trying out the guideline of \u201cfour turns\u201d [i.e. 40 diegetical minutes], or \u201cfour things\u201d \u2014 i.e. if you do things like \u201cI wait for three turns\u201d that still only counts as one \u201cthing\u201d. We\u2019re also going to test out 15 real-time minutes, or other turn counts (maybe eight is better than four perhaps, or maybe two is better).</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464274/#Comment_464274" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-24T16:46:43+00:00" title="June 24, 2017  4:46PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOk, so let\u2019s skip ahead.

Now you\u2019re in the throne room\u2026\u201d</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>So a couple of things about this example specifically. First of all, this example makes it sound to me like a GM framing a scene for players to have a confrontation with a GM NPCs on the NPCs\u2019s turf. That\u2019s not the normal case in Dramasystem. <em>Players</em> are framing the scenes. With each other, mostly, but sometimes with NPCs (one problem with our game is that our NPCs are a little too awesome and they get a little too much of the spotlight).</p>\n<p>Second of all, you\u2019re skipping over procedural stuff here. For the purposes of CC, no part of a dungeon crawl is obvious or skippable or trivial. Laws described his procedural system in Hillfolk as \u201cTV budget\u201d. Well, we have D&amp;D. We have \u201cmovie budget\u201d. I can picture the D&amp;Dfolk mashup being used for something a lot more shakespearian, without any dungeons, without the ACKS stuff. But one pillar of this mashup is <em>sweating the details</em>. We keep track of slots, HP, arrows \u2014 and Grenkin creatures. (That\u2019s how it\u2019s been so far. We\u2019ve had drama with the Grenkin creatures, we\u2019ve had the characters turn against each other, trying to protect vs fight the Grenkin creatures, freeing them, killing them, hiding this behavior from each other etc etc.)</p>\n<p>Skipping over the clich\xe9 dungeon crawl is one way to deconstruct the D&amp;D genre. But, I\u2019m going for something else. I mentioned X-Statix (a comic book). In it, sometimes they\u2019re fighting monsters and the pictures show them fight monsters with all the action. But while they\u2019re fighting, they\u2019re only talking about each other and their own drama. It doesn\u2019t skip the fight, but it does something different with it. The procedural scenes feed into the drama and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Laws described his early sessions as they used the procedural system in detail and went on procedural adventures etc, and in later sessions they would do pretty radical time skips \u201cOK, so we\u2019re home from a successful mission, I\u2019m in the kitchen nursing my wounds, when you come in\u201d and noone would challenge it. There\u2019s a voting system where you can skip procedural scenes but (Hillfolk, p25) \u201cUnlike other challenges, it takes only one objector to trigger a procedural resolution\u201d. So someone can say, in Hillfolk, \u201cWait, I\u2019m not sure that mission is so successful, let\u2019s play it out\u201d and that\u2019s a legit play and you have to rewind, by Dramasystem rules.</p>\n<p>BTW, another way to quantify the \u201cprocedural vs drama\u201d is that when my card comes up, I get to frame a scene. And sometimes instead of framing a scene, I have everyone do math stuff. Navigation checks, encounter checks, fishing rolls, income rolls etc. (And if an encounter check comes up \u201cmonster\u201d then that leads into a procedural scene right there, on my card \u2014 or a dramatic, in case the monsters speak Midani language, as many do.) And so far, I\u2019ve used about a third of my cards on math stuff and two thirds on more narrative stuff. Dramatic, such as NPCs kicking down the doors of PCs, or seeds-for-procedural, such as having a PC find a floating hobbit corpse in the harbor.</p>\n<p>Anyway, more testing is definitely needed! We have some kinks to work out for sure.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464276/#Comment_464276" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-24T17:36:59+00:00" title="June 24, 2017  5:36PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2017 5:39PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These writeups are really useful, Sandra. They illustrate much better what you're doing and how you're doing it!<br/><br/>I was skeptical at first that you were really *that* serious about honouring each "pillar" (as you put it) of your particular mixtape, but it sounds like you have, indeed, been quite hardcore about it.<br/><br/>Fascinating!<br/><br/>I think that I have enough (years and years) of baggage, memories of fighting with D&amp;D's rules and getting total nonsense which ruined drama or verisimilitude, that I wouldn't be able to participate in your game. As you pointed out, the abstraction of hit points fights the idea of "sweating the details" and the idea of being really true to the "reality" of what's going on and a coherent setting.<br/><br/><i>"It is relevant because it\u2019s part of the characters lives. It\u2019s their reality."</i><br/><br/>That's just one example, of course. I don't think I could try to honour these game-abstractions which are rampant in D&amp;D and still feel like the game world was real, in other words. How can I play serious and in-character (and feel like I'm in a consistent reality) if the rules say that, yeah, poisoning this guy might work, but stabbing him in the throat - even though he's right here, helpless, in front of me, and I've got a knife - will not?<br/><br/>I can (and sometimes have), on the other hand, imagine playing a game like this with *some other* kind of simulation-based rules which allow us to "sweat the details" and create that sense of tangibility. That concept is pretty fascinating to me (especially since I've never had a chance to try it since I became "aware" of using conscious dramatic coordination in games), and these play reports are making me think about it again.<br/><br/>I suppose the closest I've come in recent times has been with PbtA games (and things like my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17665/apocalypse-world-a-more-descriptive-visceral-approach-to-harm" rel="nofollow">descriptive harm for Apocalypse World</a>, to cut down on certain abstractions which bugged me).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to limit my time on S-G these days, but I hope this discussion will continue, and that you continue to post about this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464279/#Comment_464279" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-24T19:16:19+00:00" title="June 24, 2017  7:16PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, PbtA are definitely a fore-runner here. PbtA is turnkey and this is\u2026 this is tryhard\u2665.<br/><br/>When that knife throat thing happened in our game, I was jarred (that has been the only time so far). I was like "Huh, feels like 'dice' doesn't gel with the fiction right now". I talked to the player afterwards and they were like "No, it's cool that it didn't work, that sort of grim lethality would've felt out of place". (I was looking for their message so I could get the exact quote, but I couldn't find it.)<br/><br/>I mean\u2026 it <i>can</i> work, but the dice said no (the rule is: you get advantage + all hits are crits \u2014 i.e. it really favors Rogue). HP is, to some extent, the gods watching over you. We've talked about this a lot before. I know descriptive harm is a grail for you.<br/><br/>An aspect of gameplay where you out-Sim me.<br/><br/>But in my model of RPG mechanics as y/n procedures w/ numerical side effects, you'd need to add "do you kill them? y/n" as a procedure. Instead of, or perhaps based on, the existing attack mechanics. Would it be PC only? But no, you had the example of NPC w/ crossbow in a PC's back. A world where "Do you kill them? y/n" is a one-step procedure is a very different world from most RPGs. Dread comes to mind. Everway. Very few others. Cthulhu Dark, but, it's pretty unlikely.<br/><br/>Mechanically, I'm happy that in D&amp;D it's not usually a one-step procedure (I'm having some second thoughts on that gh\xfbl with Save or Die poison the PCs have heard rumors about). Diegetically, it can be \u2014 if you get in position, which means inflicting HP loss \u2014 then you can do it with one stroke. But it costs rolls and actions, which means that the other person might strike back before you.<br/><br/>HP, as a design component, has a high cost (the high degree of abstraction) and exploring alternatives to it is worthwhile. The only alternative is direct consequence. "Do they die? y/n?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I want to celebrate all the good things HP does. It makes many v one fights meaningful. It makes level differences still interesting. It paces the game on both a scene level and a macro level. It makes rest and sleep appealing options. It makes the players genuinely feel as beat up and vulnerable as their characters are. It's a vector for class differentiation. It conveys momentum on a subtle level.<br/><br/>The fact that it can stand for so many things, I see as a plus. The problem comes when you want to affect one of those things drastically from an extremely controlled position. 5e has chosen to pretty much double the damage, double the chance to hit (via the 'advantage + all hits are crits'\u2013rule). They've obviously thought about the situation and made a deliberate design choice. They could've quadrupled, quintupled the damage, but they didn't. This was the consequence engine they decided to build, and in this particular area, it was deliberate. (Please don't take this as an appeal to authority. House rule away! Just as a\u2026 hmm, meditation on consequence engines and the stories they create, the gameplay they enable, and the "fantasy physics" they emulate.)<br/><br/>Btw, that's something else I want documented: It's five sessions in, and no PC death. Very unusual and strange. But, the dice are all rolled openly. Of the NPCs, Setara is dead and six randos are dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464280/#Comment_464280" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-24T19:19:13+00:00" title="June 24, 2017  7:19PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The risk with this sort of thing is that we get into a "what the thinker thinks, the prover proves".

That would be derailing a bit from the topic, which is far more interesting (and far less beaten-to-death).<br/><br/>I just find it odd that you're happy with such blindingly "metagame" rules (I use the term literally, here, not in the usual "gamer" sense), given your powerful commitment to tracking details like ammunition and resting times, a consistent living fictional world, and powerful interpersonal drama.<br/><br/>To my eyes, the hit points thing is just one of many examples:<br/><br/>It seems to me that the vast majority of D&amp;D's rules - hit points, sure, but also alignments, levels, XPs, "Feats", Morale, etc, etc, etc - work SO HARD against what you seem to be going for here, in this game. For instance, you're tracking details like torches and ammunition and stuff like that, right? I can't see you going towards full-on abstraction for such things (like having "Ammunition Points"), because you want that sense of tangibility... and yet somehow hit points and XPs and ability-use-per-day and all the other D&amp;D baggage doesn't interfere with your "tangibility"?<br/><br/>(Do you roll random ability scores for characters, too?)<br/><br/>(And what happens to your Save vs. Death poison if the characters level up enough to get really good Saving Throws? Have they inexplicably developed an immunity to this poison?)<br/><br/>I can see a group that's just really, really familiar and comfortable with D&amp;D's rules (and having internalized them) using them in such an instance. It's familiar and we like it, so we choose to ignore it when possible, and subtly nudge our imaginary world and its cause and effects into a different form - just warp it, subtly or not - so that it conforms to D&amp;D's rules. (Like with the example you write about here, I can see the group just quickly reimagining that scene into one where the victim had more room or more time to turn away from the knife blow, or some other such thing. That can rescue such moments pretty well, but, again, it seems so contrary to the hardcore dedication to consistency and following through that you seem to be espousing here.)<br/><br/>Being such a self-aware gamer, do you have any insights on how you reconcile these things? Or is it just a lot of that "reimagining" going on as you play? (Putting the results of the rules first, when possible, and structuring the fiction around that.)<br/><br/>(I also need to keep reminding myself that, for all your D&amp;D5E fandom, you're actually hacking the game pretty hard, and have changed a lot of details. That's easy to forget when reading these threads! "I love D&amp;D!" -&gt; Sure, but there have been a lot of changes, too, so it's entirely possible that whatever thing I'm imagining, based on my D&amp;D experience, doesn't even happen in your game because of a certain house rule you've adopted.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464317/#Comment_464317" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-26T08:30:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2017  8:30AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I don\u2019t particularly want to get into a whole \u201cHit Points\u201d discussion in this thread.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\n<p>Much appreciated!

Hex hadn\u2019t been nearly as elegant if it had used \u201cblocking points\u201d</p>\n<p>But, conversely, Go uses its points to make the actual <em>play</em> elegant and emergent and rich. You don\u2019t need to manage points during play [though lots of pros do keep track], they\u2019re just something that you count up in the end \u2014 if someone hasn\u2019t conceded by then, also common.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to use an analogy from the world of programming.</p>\n<p>Inline method vs Extract method.</p>\n<p>This is an example of inline method. You change</p>\n<pre><code>int getRating() {<br/>  return (moreThanFiveLateDeliveries()) ? 2 : 1;<br/>}<br/>boolean moreThanFiveLateDeliveries() {<br/>  return _numberOfLateDeliveries &amp;gt; 5;<br/>}</code></pre>\n<p>to</p>\n<pre><code>int getRating() {<br/>  return (_numberOfLateDeliveries &amp;gt; 5) ? 2 : 1;<br/>}</code></pre>\n<p>Extract method is the opposite, for you change:</p>\n<pre><code>void printOwing() {<br/>  printBanner();<br/><br/>  //print details<br/>  System.out.println (&amp;quot;name:  &amp;quot; + _name);<br/>  System.out.println (&amp;quot;amount &amp;quot; + getOutstanding());<br/>}</code></pre>\n<p>to</p>\n<pre><code> void printOwing() {<br/>   printBanner();<br/>   printDetails(getOutstanding());<br/> }<br/><br/> void printDetails (double outstanding) {<br/>   System.out.println (&amp;quot;name:  &amp;quot; + _name);<br/>   System.out.println (&amp;quot;amount &amp;quot; + outstanding);<br/> }</code></pre>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to see one of these two and react <small>(and some react this way to \u201cinline\u201d, some to \u201cextract\u201d)</small> \u201c<strong>Wow!</strong> So elegant, so clever, so clear! I\u2019m going to use this <em>all the time!</em>\u201d. But don\u2019t be fooled. They have pros and cons related to each other.</p>\n<p>Extract method creates semanticity in the code such that, <em>if the semanticity was unclear</em>, makes it easier to understand for humans. It\u2019s also sometimes more practical; the extracted method is to be reused in more places for more things in a concrete way. <small>(Hence how so many 5e situations can emerge from the \u201cConditions\u201d list. The conditions have been codified &amp; \u201cextracted\u201d.)</small></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example usage of Extract method in RPG design:</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say there are some different ways to level up your player character <small>[\u201cLevels\u201d is also an abstraction but bear with me.]</small> Maybe you can write a letter. Or you can bake two cakes. Or you can kill twelve monsters. Or you can find a treasure of at least 1800 shining dimes.</p>\n<p>One <em>possible</em> design solution to <em>consider</em> (not always right) is to create an indirect, abstract, side currency, such as experience points, to handle this. To write a letter gives you 1800 xp, to bake a cake gives you 900 xp, to kill a monsters gives you 150 xp, to find a shining dime gives you 1 xp. <em>Sometimes</em> this thinking solves design problems, and sometimes it just creates more problems.

They make it so much easier to think \u201czoomed out\u201d and cross-connect concepts in new and unexpected ways. If I know a certain game concept is called \u201cNPC\u201d and I have the name \u201cNPC\u201d for that concept it becomes so much easier than if I have to constantly reinvent the idea of what having people in the fiction and how to generate them, use them and portray them.</p>\n<p>Yes, a concise, concrete and <em>direct</em> game, such as Hex, is beautiful. But sometimes \u201cextracting\u201d <em>implicit</em> concepts to new words can be worth it. The drawback is you get something abstract and weird (what\u2019s a \u201cslot\u201d, an \u201cxp\u201d, a \u201chp\u201d really? it\u2019s phlogistons and orgones for all I care) but the advantage is that you get something explicit you can handle.</p>\n<p>You put a \u201chandle\u201d on the concept.</p>\n<p>As an aside, it also sometimes can create a much richer design. Patchwork without the button currency\u2026 yeah, maybe\u2026 everything only costing hourglasses? It\u2019d be a much shallower and less interesting game!</p>\n<p>Time for some Norman, Rams and Maro design basics:</p>\n<p>Donald Norman\u2019s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_Of_Everyday_Things" rel="nofollow">The Design of Everyday Things</a> has a mischmasch of great points but the central message is this: Every function on the item you\u2019re designing should have <em>one</em> button. To make it appear simpler by removing buttons (\u201cpress the pause button three times to skip to the next song\u201d) is bad design.</p>\n<p>To extract a \u201cmethod\u201d is to <em>identify</em> a common function in the game, and <em>create a button</em> for it. And it then follows that to inline a \u201cmethod\u201d is to identify that \u201cwhoops, this thing only really matters for one thing\u201d and then bake that function into another button. \u201cOh, arrow \u2018Usage die\u2019 only matter to see whether you run out of arrows, instead let\u2019s just track arrows directly\u201d.</p>\n<p>Dieter Rams say that good design is as little design as possible. Simple and direct.</p>\n<p>But I say that the tool should match the problem domain, and complex domains sometimes need a few more semantic units (some more \u201cbuttons\u201d and \u201chandles\u201d) to be manageable. Having some functions abstracted makes it easier to see where you can combine rules. Since HP represents all \u201cexertion pacing\u201d, you have fatigue, fight momentum, and damage all rolled up into one with a simpler rule.</p>\n<p>And as always, we have Maro (paraphrased because I don\u2019t have his podcasts transcribed). \u201cA product designer makes a lamp that\u2019s easy to turn on and off. A game designer makes a lamp that\u2019s a challenge to turn on and off\u201d. The button economy in Patchwork is part of the challenge of Patchwork.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s my segue into ability-use-per-day (I told you we would get to it). In 5e, these fall into two categories. A. You can do what normal people can do, but with a bonus, for example, everyone can regain some HP during rests but fighter can regain some extra (in the middle of the fight!). B. Spells. Spells are maaagic so whatever. [I love them though! But all rules about them are rules about something already arcane.]</p>\n<p>In 5e everyone can make a lunging attack in the fiction, simply by stepping forward, stabbing the enemy, and step back.</p>\n<p>But when battlemaster uses her \u201cLunging Attack\u201d maneuver, she</p>\n<ul>\n<li>doesn\u2019t have to pay movement since the attack extends reach instead, saving an extra 5 feet</li>\n<li>doesn\u2019t trigger an opportunity attack by stepping away</li>\n<li>gets a bonus d8 to add to the attack</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this \u201cLunging Attack\u201d costs an expendable resource.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been really impressed with all of their feats and maneuvers because so few of them are things that \u201cWait, I thought everyone already could do that?\u201d. They\u2019re \u201cYou can do Normal Thing, but with a bonus\u201d.</p>\n<p>Abilities like this are primarily there because of gamism. That\u2019s what it is. We have players at our table that uses <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20658/the-searcher-very-simple-5e-class/p1" rel="nofollow">my own simple \u201cThe Searcher\u201d class</a> (that doesn\u2019t have ability scores, feats, weapon specific damage or much of anything. And we have players at our table that use multiclassing and feats and the extra types of beings from Volo\u2019s Guide to Monsters. So I guess I have all four corners of <a href="http://idiomdrottning.org/riss/" rel="nofollow">RISS</a> represented.</p>\n<p>All the \u201cmaneuvers\u201d are in an optional book, not part of the basic game, and all the \u201cfeats\u201d are in an optional chapter in that book, a chapter we didn\u2019t use for the first two years.</p>\n<p>In early 4e, these abilities had been given flavorful names (Come And Get It) and a little flavor text. They gave me the impression of being like R2D2\u2019s ability to have Leia pop out and say \u201cYou\u2019re our only hope\u201d to Obi-Wan. A canned event. Later in 4e, and throughout 5e, this changed. Instead of having an at-will \u201cCareful Attack\u201d, you now have\u2026 just a sword. Add the chopping yourself.</p>\n<p>This suits me <em>much</em> better (I know others lament the early 4e style).</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>(Do you roll random ability scores for characters, too?)</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, [highest 3 of 4d6] arrange as you wish.

Saving vs Poison in 5e are a direct function of your training (\u201cProficiency Bonus\u201d) and your health (\u201cConstitution Bonus\u201d).

In my experience, such abstract rules interfere with any desire to run either a dramatically-focused game or one which is hardcore about a commitment to a detailed fiction.<br/><br/>If I'm playing a dramatic game, it's pretty important to know whether a) the drunk person is crazy/drunk/angry enough to *actually pull the trigger*, and b) whether the gun went off at all, in terms of our commitment to a detailed and consistent fiction. Is there a disturbance? Is the gun still loaded? <br/><br/>What do we learn about this person? How out of control are they, or how willing to commit violence? <br/><br/>What do we learn about the situation? Is there a hole in the wall now? Has the noise attracted attention? If someone now picks up the gun, can they fire again, or do they need to reload? Is there a chance someone else was hurt?<br/><br/>The abstraction of that rule could clash with the dramatic instincts of the players ("The rule says I don't mark off ammo... but I really wanted to show that this dude is desperate enough to pull the trigger!") and with the interests of a detailed fiction (we need to know whether the gun went off or not, particularly if cops later investigate the situation - will they find a spent shell on the ground?).<br/><br/>I have to assume that you are simply happy to accept such limitations, which is a totally acceptable point of view. However, it surprises me because of the rather "hardcore" "mission statement" you've put together here - it seems disjointed.<br/><br/>You've said your piece on this and I *think* I understand you, so I'm not looking for a further answer from you. I just wanted to clarify where my confusion was coming from! If I was a player in your game, I'd probably be thinking about this constantly and occasionally frustrated by it.

The key to that seems to be greatly increasing the variety of diegetic (aka in-SIS) representations of a successful attack roll - where "I force them to focus on me", "I make them fear for their life", "I slip my blade past their shield" and "I crash them into the window and roll with them to the lower floor" are all equally viable attack roll outcomes (i.e. viable combat actions the effects of which are tracked with the HP-loss abstraction).<br/>Or, rather, I can see how that could pose a problem in terms of baggage - so that to make it work myself, for most players I know, I'd have to change the word "HP" to something else and perhaps avoid the brand-name "D&amp;D" altogether (while using those exact same rules, I mean).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464340/#Comment_464340" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-26T21:19:55+00:00" title="June 26, 2017  9:19PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2017 9:22PM by 2097.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>HP is now known as clock ticks and D&amp;D is now known as Blades?! <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/><br/><br/>Great point Rafu.</p>\n<p>Now some classes talk!</p>\n<p>Remember, in vanilla 5e, your class is such a small part of your character. Your background is a much bigger part of the concept. (You were also supposed to be able to write your own backgrounds but that has fallen away in practice and people have tended to use the ones in the \u201cpeachbee\u201d (Player\u2019s Handbook).)</p>\n<p>And, in the mashup, we also have a separate sheet for your Dramasystem role. So character class is a small part of who you are. Tarala is a sailor, a schemer, a devout follower of Najm, first mate on the Ummuhm, a mother, a sister, a murderer, a granddaughter\u2026 and a level 5 rogue.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, our 1001 Nights Off side campaign where we do smaller groups, other rule systems in the same continuity, the other players make it clear that in their minds \u201cclass\u201d and \u201clevel\u201d still are part of the \u201creality\u201d of Zakhara. We\u2019re playing Microscope Chronicle and they\u2019re like \u201cOK, I require a level 15 sorcerer to be present in this scene\u201d because they have a spell in mind for them to maybe cast. (I dig it!)</p>\n<p>And the class stuff can, just as the other abilities, be sorted into:</p>\n<p>A. What normal people can do, but with a bonus (i.e.\xa0everyone can hide, but rogue can spend a bonus action rather than a main action to hide). B. Maaagic. Shape shifting, qi powers, spells spells spells.</p>\n<p>Both of those I\u2019m cool with being class specific.</p>\n<p>Again, compared to AW (which, again, I\u2019m not trying to slight, I\u2019m inspired by it a lot), it\u2019s a lot more flexible on who you are and what you can do, even before we allowed multiclassing.</p>\n<p>And also as I said, some players are using <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20658/the-searcher-very-simple-5e-class/p1" rel="nofollow">the Searcher</a>. Take a look at it. You pretty much have \u201cfighting ability\u201d and \u201cnon-fighting ability\u201d, you can catch your breath, and you can push yourself to fight more. And you can use scrolls. That\u2019s it.</p>\n<p>Third avenue for the class talk (you can tell my brain is trying to prove what I already think rather than trying to reason my way some objective truth):</p>\n<p>What are the alternatives?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every character has the same capability? Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t mind if everyone was the Searcher, add variable weapon damage back to them and call it a day.</li>\n<li>Skill systems, like Call of Cthulhu? No, I don\u2019t like skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As it is I\u2019m happy with it. Another Maro-ism: restrictions breed creativity. \u201cI want to build a Paladin 2 / Valor Bard X because I can use the extra slots to smite more + I get extra attack at bard level 6. Who am I\u2026 maybe some Jeanne d\u2019Arc type in full plate? Yeah, religious, visionary\u2026 I\u2019ll ask the others if I can be party leader, have recruited the others\u2026 and when I give my bardic dice I say \u2018when I give you these dice, it means that I think of you. When you use them, it means that you believe in me.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>The ideas just keep flowing\u2026</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464341/#Comment_464341" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-26T21:21:41+00:00" title="June 26, 2017  9:21PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a D&amp;D-compatible game called Sv\xe4rd &amp; Svartkonst that calls HP "battle points".<br/><br/>I stole that (I'm translating the LMoP pregens to Swedish for my parents) but I changed "battle dice" (for hit dice) to "rest dice" which makes more sense in 5e than it does in an OSR game like Sv\xe4rd &amp; Svartkonst.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464362/#Comment_464362" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T07:49:59+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  7:49AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2017 7:50AM by Rafu.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>There is a D&amp;D-compatible game called Sv\xe4rd &amp; Svartkonst that calls HP "battle points".<br/><br/>I stole that (I'm translating the LMoP pregens to Swedish for my parents) but I changed "battle dice" (for hit dice) to "rest dice" which makes more sense in 5e than it does in an OSR game like Sv\xe4rd &amp; Svartkonst.</p></div></blockquote>\nChoice of words matters a lot! Traditionally, Italian translations of D&amp;D have rendered "hit points" as "punti ferita", which literally means "wound points". I think it's self-evident how calling them "wound points" would be at odds with using them like you're using them - you obviously can't lose "wound points" from being threatened with a bow, for example.<br/>Interestingly enough, most Italian D&amp;D-derivative designs that I know of (beginning with Kata Kumbas in the late 70s/early 80s) have chosen a different kind of abstraction, changing HPs to some "life-force" attribute or such. Words matter. A "life-force" attribute you can use to track fatigue as well as wounds - so, for example, to power spells (not unlike Strength in early editions of T&amp;T) - but definitely not to track abstract battle positioning.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464363/#Comment_464363" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T08:04:23+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  8:04AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drakar &amp; Demoner (a RuneQuest derivative [early editions were licensed translations of the old Worlds of Wonder set's Magic World])  use "body points", which, well. might as well be meat points at that point.<br/><br/>I'm OK with it just being a mix of fatigue &amp; meat (and then mostly fatigue), that's good enough for me, but if I can go further, of course I want to go further\u2665<br/><br/>or you could go the GURPS route and do the opposite thing and have HP, FP, aiming as a specific action, one hex = one yard etc etc. Maybe some day\u2026 once I'm a lot smarter than I'm right now\u2026                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464374/#Comment_464374" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T16:56:11+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  4:56PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One hybrid form of HP I've considered for my own "house D&amp;D" (which is sadly still unplayed at the moment) is to have abstract hit points but with "tags" or "labels".<br/><br/>For instance, a huge, feral beast monster might have:<br/><br/>3 Hit Dice (Physical toughness)<br/>3 Hit Dice (Hyper-reflexes)<br/><br/>While an enemy wizard might just have:<br/><br/>5 Hit Dice (Prepared magical spell defenses, amulets and trinkets)<br/>1 Hit Die (Preternatural self-discipline, against mind control, torture, etc)<br/><br/><i>Note that both have 6 Hit Dice.</i><br/><br/>The idea being that, after the Hit Points are done, future damage causes severe injury or death (or whatever your rules are for 0 hit points).<br/><br/>It accomplishes much of the fun of abstract hit points (you can ignore these labels MOST of the time and just add up the hit points), but allows some interesting interactions with tactics and decision-making.<br/><br/>For instance, is it worthwhile to shoot poisoned arrows at the huge beast? Well, good luck with that. But if it's immobilized somehow? Well, then it only has 3 Hit Dice (effectively) against your poisoned arrows. It's still tough, but it can't dodge anymore.<br/><br/>What about the wizard? He can stand still and you can shoot those poisoned arrows at him... but he'll laugh at you and prepare his magic to strike you down. He doesn't rely on mobility. However, strip him naked, break his concentration (or maybe break his spirit by capturing his daughter!) and submit him to the same poisoned arrows and he'll fall from the first one that strikes him. <br/><br/>Same if you have some kind of anti-magic sword: it is obvious that it will penetrate his magical defenses and bring him down.<br/><br/>We can adjudicate this pretty easily and fairly in play without having planned ahead to do so. That makes for interesting tactical interactions (at least in my mind; this is still unplaytested, as I said earlier).<br/><br/>This seems to me to be more fun and flexible than D&amp;D's default method, which is abstract HP and AC and then additional, complicated rules for *anything* which might bypass them. Poison? Special rules. Weapons which have improved function against armour? Special rules. Magical weapons? Special rules. (My favourite example is the Vorpal Sword, or anything that tries to "bypass" hit points for some special effect!)<br/><br/>These special rules are almost impossible to balance or make work consistently - they either create weird unbelievable situations or they threaten to invalidate the whole point of HP (like save vs. death effects, as per the vorpal sword).<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I'm totally fine with ignoring this for PCs - my sense is that D&amp;D PCs are already defined by so many abstract quantities that we just accept as markers of their "special status" (XP, levels, fast advancement, character generation rules, etc, etc) that fully abstract hit points are no stretch of the imagination. (Though I do want to change the way armor class works so that we know when someone's been hit; that just seems like too important a piece of information to ignore in a tactical warfare game, where bleeding, poisons, damage to important items, fire, slime, magical effects, and so forth all often depend on whether you managed to avoid something or not.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464396/#Comment_464396" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-28T05:23:45+00:00" title="June 28, 2017  5:23AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2017 5:27AM by adamwb.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very much like <a href="https://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/02/27/dont-roll-your-hit-points-until-youre-hurt/" rel="nofollow">this old mule abides post</a> about Hit Dice for player characters representing different aspects.<br/><br/>Actually I kind of want to do this.
