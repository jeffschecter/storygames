I want to talk about when the two sort of come together. Here's what I mean: in my game-in-progress Where The Heart Is I have a section which I call the Interval (gameplay is divided into five Acts), where the players discuss how the characters have been behaving, and what they think about them. This mechanic was aimed partly at minimising harmful bleed by giving the players a break from the roleplaying, but I'm fascinated by the idea of player vs character, and the interface, if any, between the two, so much so that I plan to introduce a similar section in other games that I design (of course, it might not always be helpful or desirable, I'll have to play it by ear).

One is a projected alter-ego game in which players take on the role of a character and make decisions in character related to some ongoing struggle versus whatever is happening in the world (i.e. "roleplaying"); while the other is a reality-level collaborative writing game in which people contribute to an ongoing narrative without knowing what twists and events the others may inject into play, which makes "plotting" more like "surfing" - a fast-paced adaptive creative writing exercise.  For shorthand's sake, these two games can be considered manifestations of "Actor Stance" and "Author Stance", respectively.  (If all Players have the same amount of vested creative power at the world level, with the ability to create not only their own characters and locations but obstacles and antagonists as well, this is "Director Stance".)<br/><br/>In some (few) games, the distinction of stance is clearly indicated.  The "Setup" phase in <i>Fiasco</i>, for instance, is 100% Author Stance; play then jumps down to the more immersive level of Actor Stance as scenes are played out.  But in most games, Players are tacitly <i>assumed</i> to remain in one stance most of the time, even if this stance is not specified as such.  (And it cannot be denied that Players continually jump back and forth between Actor Stance and Author Stance throughout the course of play, and that this has a lot to do with the character sheet as well as the game mechanics themselves.)<br/><br/>If high character immersion is the goal, Actor Stance is the assumed default state, and shifting to Author Stance may be experienced as a disruption of Flow.  This in fact is one of the greatest functional justifications for the existence of a GM in a trad game: a person whose job is to remain in Author Stance (or Director Stance) at all times, allowing the Players to remain in Actor Stance as much as possible.<br/><br/>If high narrative cohesion is the goal, Author Stance is the assumed default state, and shifting to Actor Stance has the effect of "slowing down time" and "zooming in".  This is because narratives move faster in Author Stance than they do in Actor Stance.  However depending on the Flow of the narrative at Author level, zooming in may seem unnecessarily detailed, or simply unnecessary, an amusing joke or impromptu close-up, but not a literal requirement.<br/><br/>Sometimes the zooming in and out is the whole point - I almost wrote "<i>Microscopic</i>" above - and of course this is precisely the effect Ben Robbins is going for.  But it's a tricky goal, and Ben has made himself a specialist in pursuit of it.<br/><br/>More often than not, zooming from one stance to another is a disruption, or presents a mental challenge.  I think I'd say that zooming out is generally easier than zooming in; and not just because the detail level increases as you zoom in, but even more because of the psychological <i>Shift</i> that must take place inside the Player's head.  Some people seem incapable of zooming all the way in to Actor Stance at all, while others can do it if given a little help, atmosphere and prompting.<br/><br/>So in one sense this is a <i>Design Challenge</i>, and in another it is a <i>Play Challenge</i>.  Willfully engaging either of these challenges will definitely affect the flow and feel of play.  So in conclusion: I'd say that (1) it never hurts to point out the existence of the stances taken by Players in your game, more games should do this just for the sake of clarity.  But also (2) think about the shift, not just the zoom.  In other words: the number, structure, frequency, duration and placement of those "transitional moments" (anything that requires a Player to zoom from one stance to another) - should not be taken lightly.  In some games they should be minimized and brushed under the rug.  In other games the whole point is about engaging them.  They are <i>infrastructural</i> to the game; they literally determine what kind of game you are playing.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438214/#Comment_438214" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T12:32:49+00:00" title="September  9, 2014 12:32PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the idea of fooling around with the presentation of the "meta" level of play. There's a very interesting difference between, say, asking Bob how he feels about what Jill's character is doing, or asking a player to write a faux newspaper article explaining the public reaction to Jill's characters' recent activities.<br/><br/>InSpectres' "confessionals" come to mind, like interviews with actors on a reality TV show. I've seen games where players write letters or diaries "in-character", and that can be really revealing, and add depth to the game by revealing the characters' (and players') "inner lives". What other fun approaches have you seen?<br/><br/>I also find I really enjoy playing with people who do this regularly as part of play, particularly if they are strangers or people I haven't played with before.<br/><br/>I remember once playing a game of <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> with some people I knew a little, but had never gamed with before. My character and another player's character were at odds, and mine did something she really didn't like. The player was glaring at me angrily across the table from then on, and it made things really uncomfortable. I wasn't sure if she was upset with me, or if she was just trying to act out her character's feelings at the table. <br/><br/>It turned everything was fine, but it took me out of the game for a while. If she had winked at me, or said something like, "Wow, your character's really a bastard! I love it," or even, "Man, Aphelia is really pissed off about that right now!", that would have made things much easier.<br/><br/>It does make me think of an interesting thing here: we usually talk about how talking "about" the game or out-of-character might break someone out of immersion, but, in this case, having to worry about whether the player was actually unhappy about something (or not enjoying playing with me for some reason) was far more distracting than any kind of "out-of-character" dialogue could possibly have been. <br/><br/>I've played with groups who make a lot of commentary about the play in progress ("Ooh, wow, that Elisa's really got a thing coming to her!" - "Obviously, Kendrick's got the hots for this new addition to the party" - "Oh, I like the direction your character's going with this whole new angle!"). I (personally) don't find the commentary any harder to "filter out" of my imaginary space than the dice and character sheets and the fact that Bob's chewing on some chips during the climactic fight scene, but it makes play easier and smoother, and allows us to share our enthusiasm about what's happening, which I really enjoy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438219/#Comment_438219" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T12:58:10+00:00" title="September  9, 2014 12:58PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2014 12:58PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It does make me think of an interesting thing here: we usually talk about how talking "about" the game or out-of-character might break someone out of immersion, but, in this case, having to worry about whether the player was actually unhappy about something (or not enjoying playing with me for some reason) was far more distracting than any kind of "out-of-character" dialogue could possibly have been. <br/><br/>I've played with groups who make a lot of commentary about the play in progress ("Ooh, wow, that Elisa's really got a thing coming to her!" - "Obviously, Kendrick's got the hots for this new addition to the party" - "Oh, I like the direction your character's going with this whole new angle!").

A background in theater might do much the same...<br/><br/>On a more general topic, I'm working my way through Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine, which has a fairly startling amount of game-mechanical widgets that revolve around telegraphing your character's emotional state to the table.  The one that leaps immediately to mind is the "Lurid" Quest:\n<blockquote>You\u2019re torn between two worlds or two selves. There\u2019s a seed of wickedness in you; or sickness; or corruption; or maybe just another self, another form, some flowering change; or pain.<br/><br/>[...] You\u2019re in one state, or the other. You\u2019re in control, or you are lost. You\u2019re the person you\u2019ve been trying to be, or the person you were. You\u2019re sick, or you\u2019re OK. You\u2019re transforming, or you\u2019re not; hurting, or you\u2019re not; having whatever problem it is happen... or you\u2019re not. <br/><br/>You can get the bonus XP when you flip between states in active play\u2014in the middle of a scene. This can be something you say or emote\u2014 \u201cI am now hurting\u201d or \u201cI am now a suspicious character.\u201d This is usually something you say or<br/>emote, I bet.<br/><br/>...but if possible, I\u2019d like you to have a two-sided sign.<br/><br/>Keep it in front of you on the gaming table to reflect the two states of your being. Have one side that faces up when everything is OK and one that you flip to when corruption, metamorphosis, trauma, wickedness, or the allure of some distant treasure gets to you.<br/><br/>Some example signs include:<br/>Curious / Too Curious.<br/>Troubled / Free.<br/>OK / Haunted.<br/>Innocent / Suspicious.<br/>Grounded / Daydreaming<br/>Sober / Drunk<br/>At Home in Fortitude / Called to the Bleak Academy<br/>Ordinary Kid / Obvious Delinquent<br/>Cautious / Tempted</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438221/#Comment_438221" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T13:48:40+00:00" title="September  9, 2014  1:48PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I sometimes wonder if having GMing experience helps with letting these kinds of details not interfere with immersion, since GMing generally requires slipping into and out of different characters on the fly as well as gauging the group's mood.

I won't respond to every point, but I'll draw attention to a few that strike me as particlualrly salient:<br/><br/>!. Games indicating very explicitly whether the stance is either <i>Actor</i> or <i>Author</i>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very</span> important IMO to flag this specicifally, like the way most gaming groups have signals for when one is speaking in or out of game. Forex, I was playing in a tense game of <i>Kult</i> a couple of years ago, where this other player kept slipping in and out of game, without signalling one way or another, which I found not only disconcerting and confusing but also a breach of gamer etiquette, confirming me in my opinon (which had been fermeting for some time perviously) not to game with him again.<br/><br/>2. Zooming in and out (and you're absoloutely on the button for referencing Microscope, and <a href="/forums/profile/Ben_">@Ben_</a> Robbins' pursuit of that design goal). You're right, it does present both a <i>design challenge</i> and a <i>play challenge</i>, and I think it goes without sayng that the immersion-breaking nature of it makes it hard for many if not most trad players to get behind it. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> I too like fooling around with meta, BUT:\n<blockquote>I remember once playing a game of <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> with some people I knew a little, but had never gamed with before.

And of course, this doesn't affect only story games, and I'd even go as far as to say that it's <i>more</i> problematic in trad games, because in trad games most players assume they can handle player vs character, but it's not always easy to see whether or not negative bleed is occuring when your dwarf cleric is being given a pasting by another player's Ogre. I mean, you get to thinking, as you did, <i>WTF?</i> Is that your character doing that, or is it you? In trad games, players can <i>hide behind</i> their character much more easily than in narrative games.\n<blockquote>I sometimes wonder if having GMing experience helps with letting these kinds of details not interfere with immersion, since GMing generally requires slipping into and out of different characters on the fly as well as gauging the group's mood.</blockquote>No, I think it's still difficult.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
