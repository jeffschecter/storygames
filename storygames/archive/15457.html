Board games all stress player counts in their design, you even see mass market publishers putting this information on the front of their boxes. so it must be a pretty important right.<br/><br/>Most games with a Players &amp; GM structure are at their core 2 player games. the GM plays one side and the players side is a team effort.<br/><br/>What do you think are the effects of raising or lowering the number of player's in games like this?<br/><br/>The questions get a little harder with the more complicated player structures in modern rpgs. What are some games you feel work best with a particular number of players? <br/><br/>What is a good number of player's for fiasco? why?<br/><br/>How do you feel about games like GxB that have built in player counts and do not work with more or less?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350478/#Comment_350478" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T19:55:25+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  7:55PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2011 8:01PM by jenskot.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a roleplay heavy game, I usually want 1 hour per player (not including GM). 1/2 hour per player if the rules are more free form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350482/#Comment_350482" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T20:26:48+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  8:26PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did that analysis with The Trouble with Rose.  Three turned out to be the effective minimum due to the audience voting mechanic.  With 3-5 players you get five scenes each and that works out to two to three hours with a prepared play set.  With 6-7 players, I drop that to 4 scenes each.  Part of that was for game duration, but also because the use of dominoes is a natural constraint on the maximum number of total scenes (28 max.)<br/><br/>While you could go with 8 players with three scenes each, I don't think that would work.  The story would be all over the place and no one would have enough spotlight time to develop their character and affect the plot.  With that many, I'd rather they break into two groups of four players.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350505/#Comment_350505" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T04:33:27+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  4:33AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If "player" represents more than one person whose characters share the same goal, increasing from one to two or more "players" sounds really interesting. You get some kind of competitive teams thing happening. You probably need much more elaborate ways to adjudicate.<br/><br/>The sweet spot for Fiasco is four players, which results in 16 scenes, which, on average, resolve themselves in under three hours. Four scenes per player means that everyone has a chance to found, build, complicate  and conclude a simple narrative arc for their dude. Four players means that you start the game with one dude completely unconnected to your own and, ideally, a pair of Needs on the table. Because number of scenes rises and falls in tandem to number of players, three and five are practical upper and lower bounds.<br/><br/>Games with fixed or constrained player counts are more brittle and less usable, so consider the tradeoffs carefully. In board games my favorite counter-example is Castle Panic, which scales effortlessly, on the fly, from one to six players, and is limited only by the number of cards they give you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350528/#Comment_350528" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T09:09:40+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  9:09AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience has been that pretty much every story game (with a few exceptions) works well for a certain number of players, and falls apart when you stray too far from that.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's for basic, mechanical reasons (for example, Dogs in the Vineyard is really hard to run for a large group if the Dogs are hard-nosed about sticking together and don't disagree on issues, because of the way the dice work, or maybe you just don't have enough dice for a large group!), sometimes it's for more human reasons (e.g. for this game, you need one sheet of paper per player and five relationships, so having more than four players means you run out of table space and can't remember who all the characters).<br/><br/>So I say, "Yes!"<br/><br/>I always try to put a "player count" on games I design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350564/#Comment_350564" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T11:53:08+00:00" title="December  5, 2011 11:53AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things I found particularly interesting about D&amp;D 4E was that they lowered the sweet spot for player count considerably.<br/><br/>With old campaigns from the 70s and 80s, you constantly hear about groups of 8 or more people playing. Reading through some of the early modules, it seems pretty clear to me that they were written for pretty big groups. I've seen occasions in modules where a fight is supposed to start with 8 enemies, and 6 or 8 more are supposed to show up in a round or two from adjoining rooms. And 3 or 4 of those are leveled up lieutenants and such. So it would take a pretty big group to have a good chance of success there.<br/><br/>With 3rd edition, it seemed like the sweet spot was about 5 or 6 players. Most of the modules seemed to be written with that sort of party size assumed.<br/><br/>With 4th edition, the game is very specifically written for a 4 player party, with one each of the standard "roles" covered. If the party varies from that, you adjust the encounters accordingly. But the default is to write them all for that balanced 4 player party.<br/><br/>I found that interesting, and I think it's one of the many examples of ways the game has been cleaned up to make it easier for new people to start playing it.<br/><br/>So the giant elephant game is certainly right there with you in terms of thinking that identifying a sweet spot of player count is a useful and important thing to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350595/#Comment_350595" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T15:14:38+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  3:14PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exalted similarly has an assumed group size of five (perhaps three if you're playing Lunars).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350631/#Comment_350631" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T20:14:37+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  8:14PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D 4e presumes a default party size of 5.

As Jason said, there's no downtime in a two-player game, and also the entire game hinges on the players' ability to improvise descriptions of exciting and brutal combat moves, so creative exhaustion can hit pretty quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350708/#Comment_350708" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T14:08:21+00:00" title="December  6, 2011  2:08PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahhh, yeah Player Count and Games is an important thing for me, especially if the designer has advice for group size.<br/><br/>Games with a definite set number of players ("only four") that aren't 2-player like Breaking the Ice, are very hard for me to organize. I've been trying for about two months now on various openings to get people together for a game of Silver and White (Jackson Tegu's cool weird young adult urban fantasy game, I love reading it!). Unfortunately, without fail someone will have to back out for real (that is, not BS) reasons, or I send out a heads up to 4-6 people and a fifth person says "I'll be there!" ...so it's kinda hard, we end up playing another game of 3-5 players since it doesn't work with anything other than Just Four People. Which is awesome, but in this weird case (and this is not a common situation, BTW; it's like I flipped a coin 5 times in a row and it just happened to come up tails each time) it's not working.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350763/#Comment_350763" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T07:44:57+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  7:44AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion makes me want to write a game that works better the more people you have in it.

There are a few in Europe that get up to about 5000 participants.<br/><br/>The biggest ones all focus on organizing around factions and having those factions pitched against each other, allowing individual plot to arise organically as you interact with the big picture.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways, they are designed like a 9 player parlor larp with prescripted characters. Except that each of those 9 characters is actually a faction with, say, 100-500 people in it. (Yes, they do a lot more than just whip out 9 faction writeups, but that is a big part of the core.)<br/><br/>But I'm guessing you aren't actually thinking about that kind of scale.<br/><br/>The way a game works and how a player interacts with it and what expectations they can reasonably have about it changes MASSIVELY as you scale up from a small intimate tabletop game with 2-3 people to a game with 50 participants, to a game with 500+ participants. There are benchmark points where what works from one scale to the next changes dramatically.<br/><br/>I have an essay on simultaneous action in larp that touches on this, if any are interested in the subject.<br/><a href="http://www.mortalisrpg.com/forum/downloads/2010SummitBook.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mortalisrpg.com/forum/downloads/2010SummitBook.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350792/#Comment_350792" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T12:53:15+00:00" title="December  7, 2011 12:53PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2011 12:54PM by UserClone.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Colin_Fredericks</cite>This discussion makes me want to write a game that works better the more people you have in it.
