Lucky fuckin' players.  Now what about the poor, long-suffering GM?  Can the same process inspire the creation (and structure the play) of a <i>situation</i>?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking, at its most basic, that this would be something like "Okay, I'm pulling ... hmm ... "Rivalry" and ... not "Romantic" ... not "Social" ... AH!  "Competitive!"  Absolutely!  A rival gang is trying to muscle into your territory, pushing drugs on the street-corners that <i>you guys</i> work to keep clean, and generally being thuggish in all the wrong ways.  Time for you to set them straight and show what a street-gang is really about!"  And then Rivalry would have a set of keys that pay the GM for introducing certain things, and "Competitive" would have a set of keys that pay the GM for introducing certain things.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, see ... I can only give that example, or any example, by assuming a certain set of independent axes (in this case "What the type of the conflict is" and "What the arena is") and I am <i>totally unsure</i> what the right set of axes is.  In fact, I'm pretty damn sure that in this case these axes aren't even really independent.  Can one really have a rivalry that isn't competitive?<br/>\n<br/>\n"Abilities" x "Persona" has decades of testing to show us how it works, its strengths and its weaknesses.  I generally think that it is, if not THE right way to do characters, A right way.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the best of my knowledge there is <i>no</i> substantial exploration of what axes one should use to break out situation creation.

And then you'd combined that with ablative traits to give an actual count-down to when you were finally allowed to determine success-or-failure on that Issue.

(I'd suggest not requiring a conflict to do the discards; just make it a free choice). Then the card economy will kick in to cue people when they're in a strong enough position to try for their Goal, and the desire to get into that position will structure the session.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78710/#Comment_78710" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T08:58:56+00:00" title="June 29, 2007  8:58AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sydney Freedberg</cite>That would make coming up with proper adversity stupidly simple, I think.</blockquote>I think you're seriously underestimating how stupid something needs to be before it's simple for me when I have no time to think :-)<br/><br/>One thing that would go a long way, however, would be if those Goal cards were in front of the GM rather than in front of the players.

And I bet you could use the same concept for creating other things, too! Like situations!" Which is why in <em>Depths of Kanthe</em>, I build each dungeon level out of a combination of Type (rooms, caves, maze...) and Theme (crypt, temple, lair...)</p>\n<p>Which brings up a point: Conflict x Arena might not be the best cross-product for every game, because some games assume specific kinds of conflicts. My dungeon-crawl game already defines a conflict. So does <em>Misery Bubblegum</em>, doesn't it? The conflict is always about what you want your character to be versus how other people see your character. So it might make more sense to on the arenas where such conflicts could play out... maybe School Activity x Event? School Activities would be Academics, Athletics, and some social activities I'm not sure how to name, like trying to fit in to a group or trying to get a girlfriend/boyfriend. Events would be things like dances, talent shows, exams, disciplinary actions... or maybe something more generic which, when combined with School Activities, produce those kinds of events. Then, you modify the situation details to provide tie-ins to the characters: because the teachers see Jimmy as a Math Whiz, they want him to compete in the Mathlympics, but Jimmy wants attention from a clique or girl who expresses disgust with the Mathlympics.</p>\n<p>Something like that.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78762/#Comment_78762" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T11:37:39+00:00" title="June 29, 2007 11:37AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>So it might make more sense to on the arenas where such conflicts could play out... maybe School Activity x Event?</blockquote>\nThis has real potential.

If the subject is Academics, some of the characters are going to be viewed as unworthy in that activity, others are going to be seen as excellent.</p>\n<p>Another thing that occurs to me is that maybe the Activities could be matched to qualities they provide that the character types connect to... looking at the original thread, I see things like "Bookworm: You want people to think things through, You want to understand, Structure is a good thing" and think that the situations should provide possible hooks for that, like "Academics is: structured; Academics can be: understood, thought through". So one possibility would be to go through the roles and see what is needed, then create Activities that potentially provide those needs (you need something with rules, for example, so that Feisty people can break them and Obedient people can obey them.)</p>\n<p>Sydney might have something in changing the axis to Characters, but I'm not sure it should be character types: rather, it should be something like social situations that the events can latch onto.

One way to define this importance is to explicitly state who the student hopes to be, and what the student hopes to do/have done, at that time. For example, the princess hopes to be prom queen, and wants to rub that bitch Chrissi's (spelt with an 'i') face in it.<br/><br/>I think you're approaching this in far too structured a manner. The thing is you don't need to come up with a situation...<br/><br/>...High School IS the situation!<br/><br/>And if any two characters don't automatically create a situation, then you're playing High School wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78927/#Comment_78927" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T14:43:49+00:00" title="June 30, 2007  2:43PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How does 'Mood' work for you as another potential axis, Tony?

Remember the "Take a card when you shock two or more people" key-punch in Naughty?  That one gave us trouble in play, precisely because every time you try to do it you have to poll the table before you can take your card.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Evil Overlord List, #85:  I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly complicated, e.g. "Align the 12 Stones of Power on the sacred altar then activate the medallion at the moment of total eclipse." Instead it will be more along the lines of "Push the button."</div>\n</blockquote>\nOr, as my sensei always says, "Mo' simple, mo' bettah."<br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast, I offer a "Rivalry" key that looks more like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Demonstrate an advantage that another cannot attain<br/>\n- Refuse any solution but total victory<br/>\n- Demonstrate a vulnerability<br/>\n<br/>\nI think these would <i>often</i> lead to the same sorts of questions you list.  For instance:  the GM is motivated <i>not</i> to offer vulnerabilities that would give the PCs a fair advantage in the arena of combat ... but she's also motivated (by cards!) to show some vulnerability.  So what does she do?  She shows a vulnerability that the PCs <i>couldn't possibly</i> take advantage of without being scum-bags.  And so on and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage (to my eyes) is that as a GM I can <i>do</i> any of those things unilaterally.  I can say "Kyomi is an unstoppable biker-chick engine of destruction ... even hardened gang-bangers fear her.  She has challenged you to a fight ... and she has a clear advantage in that arena that you cannot possibly match," and just take a card.  Likewise, I can say "<i>But</i>, you know that she loves her little sister, Sakura, dearly and tries to protect her from all this violence," and take another card.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that the players might view that combination as presenting a powerful choice (Cheat by taking advantage of Kyomi's kind feelings and Sakura's innocence to try to win the conflict before it even starts?  Or play it fair and get your face rearranged?) ... that's gravy.  I already <i>got</i> my cards.  Doesn't matter to me whether the players think it's a huge, charged choice or just think that kidnapping Sakura and holding her for ransom is the obvious strategic move.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does that strike you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79062/#Comment_79062" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T07:13:40+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  7:13AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you're probably right that unilateral key-punches are much, much easier to administer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79071/#Comment_79071" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T07:45:41+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  7:45AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Sydney, I'm looking at your People/Relationship keys and what they imply for the GM.

I'm inclined to leave room for when the GM just wants to provide adversity in order to force PCs into a crucible <i>with each other</i>.  Like, <i>Mountain Witch</i> is all about how people affect each other, but the GMs job isn't to provide that particular adversity, it's just to keep turning up the pressure on the players until they provide it for each other.<br><br>I think right now I'm inclined to put things like "Rivalry" alongside other Hooks (i.e. "Structures that make your participation interesting <b>including</b> the structure of adversity vs. accomplishment) such as "Escape," "Quest," and "Mystery" ... and then maybe cross-product that with Stakes like "Romantic," "Social," "Competitive," and so on.<br><br>You end up with things like "Social Mystery" and "Competitive Quest" and "Romantic Rivalry" ... all of which seem, at first blush, workable to me ... though clunky in places.
