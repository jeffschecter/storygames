Not a place I frequent.<br/><br/>Clearly, it was done by way of a fan.  The files posted were legitimate electronic forms of the game, so they came from some purchase-source in the past, and the file included a character sheet that someone from the fan community had created.  And most of SOTC is free already, due to the OGL.  So the exposure here's pretty minimal.<br/><br/>The IP that got exposed, here, was the layout I did, the setting material, and Christian's art (plus maybe a couple other things).  Normally I wouldn't pay this much mind -- PDFs are really just opportunities to convert to print sales, the way I look at it -- but it's not just Evil Hat's stuff on the line.  Our artist retains the rights to the art used in the book (we just got the right to publish those works ourselves), and as such I gotta take action on his behalf.  So I dropped a mail to the filehosting site's abuse address asking them to take it down.<br/><br/>I doubt anyone who might read this did this, of course.  But I just wanted to put this out there.  If you are someone who wants to share our game, we've got a bunch of free and legal ways that won't force me to take action that can be done to share (most) of our game with folks you want to get on board, to learn how it's a cool thing.  All of those free and legal forms of SOTC are available on <a href="http://www.faterpg.com/" rel="nofollow">FateRPG.Com</a>.  If you're looking to share, please point people there!

Or it's actually more realistic to say "I make most of my PDF purchases at work: I download it once or twice there, and then download it again 1-2 times when I get home".<br/><br/>I remember I had problems with the Beast Hunters PDF, so it took like 5-8 downloads over 2 days from 2-3 PCs to get it to work.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AdamK" title="AdamK"><img alt="AdamK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AdamK">AdamK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70627/#Comment_70627" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-20T12:03:40+00:00" title="May 20, 2007 12:03PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if we want to discuss warez in depth here, but I'll just start with my own experiences.<br/><br/>I had Universalis as a pirate PDF. I played it, then bought it along with some other story games. (Totally offtopic: Fred, I received the Roach cards friday, they're awesome, IPR rocks.)<br/><br/>I never bought a PDF version of a game and I'm not afraid to admit that I have a total of 5 gigabytes of RPGs on my hard drive - doesn't make me proud though. D&amp;D and Universalis were the only ones I've ever played. I've read maybe 2-3 books this way, the rest of the books I just skimmed through one or two times. Why downloading them you ask? I started with it to get back into gaming without taking any financial risk (unused books), and continued so "I have this book about angels and demons just in case of emergency," then I downloaded some books to share them with the warez community (which exists and is in fact, a nice community). After maybe one year of activity I stopped downloading because I realized I do nothing with the files.<br/><br/>I'd say there are four types of people in RPG-warez land:<ul>\n<li>The ones who don't care about what they download. They'll never read it, they wouldn't ever try to buy it. This is the masses.</li>\n<li>"Community builders." They download so others can download the same files later. The part of the crowd that actually uses chat to communicate with each other.</li>\n<li>Interested people. They'll download the book, read it, maybe even play it and seriously consider a buy. I'd say if it comes to a play session, a good portion of them will buy the book afterwards.</li>\n<li>Real warez users. These are the ones who'll not buy the book if not necessary and will use what they download. Most of them are students or people from East-Europe, Asia or South-America. (This isn't an excuse, just a remark.)</li></ul>\nI'd say if your target audience consists in a large part of students, you should do whatever you can to stop illegal downloads. And I totally and fully understand Fred's problem with not wanting other's work (illustration in his case) getting pirated by whoever wants to do it. It's totally the way to go if you want to be a serious business partner.<br/><br/>If I'd be asked for advice (which isn't the case but here I go anyway), I'd say try to ask for removal if you encounter an illegal copy of your game, but never threaten (threatening gets your game into the "pirated <i>and</i> buy not considered" section). Offer a demo (or "no layout and illustrations") version to be uploaded instead of the illegal copy if you can. (People download files, not links - I'd say an URL doesn't get you much attention. You should still include it in your request though, who knows what happens.)<br/><br/>As an aside, I consider getting people from warez-land interested in playtesting games. If I'll ever get so far and have a game ready to playtest outside my gaming group, I'll totally try it. Hopefully they'll not ban me forever thinking I'm a "spy."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70632/#Comment_70632" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-20T13:32:35+00:00" title="May 20, 2007  1:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Case study:<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone on RPG.Net was talking about <i>Donjon</i>.

Result:  Almost my entire group has bought a copy.<br>I've also done that with Burning Empires.  Result:  We haven't caused any more sales than my initial two, but we're actually able to play the game because everyone who was interested in reading the rules before we started playing was able to do so.

This all started when Drive Through started and had all that shitty DRM and watermarking on the PDFs they were selling.  As expected, the DRM didn't stop stuff appearing.  Within a couple of days of Exalted 2nd going up for sale, files started appearing with names like exalted_2nd_edition_dewatermarked.pdf.  So obviously watermarking and DRM don't help prevent piracy.<br/><br/>I look at his stuff mostly because I think that it gives me a decent cross section on what people are playing.  Although that is probably not very accurate, because I imagine that most of the stuff people download goes into an archive and never, ever gets read much less played.<br/><br/>I've downloaded files of games to see what the file was like (although, for moral reasons, only stuff I already owned).  Generally they fall into three camps:<br/><br/>Actual commercial PDFs.<br/>High quality scans<br/>Rubbish scans.<br/><br/>A lot of the commercial PDFs aren't actually the exact same commercial PDF that is for sale.  Quite often it's a PDF print of a PDF, if that makes sense, which has been created to circumvent DRM.  A typical 250-300 page pdf is about 15 megs, depending on artwork, optimisation etc.  All the ones I've seen look pretty good (as in, they look like a commercial PDF).<br/><br/>High quality scans are usually very readable.  Although they are generally just scans with raster images of the pages of the book.  Not as attractive as a commercial PDF, but readable.  You could read a book like this and if you printed it it'd probably look OK, but obviously not the same as a "proper" PDF.<br/><br/>Rubbish scans are pretty awful and borderline unreadable.  I can't imagine anyone wanting these at all.  But I assume that people download them to hoard.<br/><br/>Needless to say, what you see most of is D&amp;D.  Also stuff like D&amp;D software tools (etools and the like) appear all the time.  I don't really see much indie stuff.  In fact, I can't remember seeing any, although I've not been checking as much lately.  White Wolf stuff appears all the time, especially the newer stuff.  There's a massive amount of "Nostalia" stuff there too, like there'll be a Star Frontiers or Gamma World 1st ed flood every now and then.<br/><br/>I have downloaded stuff that I've actually used, but only stuff I already owned the hardcopy of.  Like for printing the tables and whatnot in the back of a book.  I've also bought a ton of PDFs over the years, and although I've never given PDF copies of games to my players, I have given printed copies to them.  That is, when we played Paladin, I printed 3 copies and the players got one each so they could learn the rules.  I don't know if this is strictly legal, but I do know that it didn't reduce sales of the game because the guys in question aren't games per se and don't even own their own dice.  Also, there's no chance of them selling a copy that's basically just a duplex laser print with a staple in the corner (and I thing Paladin is now downloadable for free anyway).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Olle%20Jonsson" title="Olle Jonsson"><img alt="Olle Jonsson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://olle.1av10.nu/pics/site/face.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Olle%20Jonsson">Olle Jonsson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70703/#Comment_70703" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T02:34:09+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  2:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2007 3:01AM by Olle Jonsson.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The one thing that came to me when looking at the MERP material I had downloaded was: Oh, the horrid crap we used to be impressed by!

You can also find scanned copies of Sorcerer and all its supplements; you can also find Capes, DitV, Dead Inside, Burning Empires and TSOY. I only mention "indie" games, obviously you can find every WW or WotC product ever conceived there.\n<blockquote>Real warez users. These are the ones who'll not buy the book if not necessary and will use what they download. Most of them are students or people from East-Europe, Asia or South-America. (This isn't an excuse, just a remark.)</blockquote>\nI've been having a lot of (small) success spreading the FATE gospel using the SRD, not here, in Mexico (I would be the South-American student from the example) but in Spain and Finland. I don't send a copy of my (original) PDF to anyone. Will this generate some more sales for Evil Hat? I have no idea. I hope so, but, from the player perspective, that is not the to do it; I just do it because I love the game.<br/><br/>However, if my friend Carlos in Finland asks me why I'm behaving like a raving lunatic about Dogs in the Vineyard, the easiest thing for me to do is to point him in the direction of an illegal PDF. I can't lend him my own dead-tree copy (bought on a second hand bookstore, BTW, I have no idea if it's original), and no amount of chatting is going to express the pure awesome of the game. Will this lead to a new DitV sale? I know I gained a new DitV convert, but in this whole transaction not a single dollar went to Lumpley games (besides, maybe, from whomever bought the original copy).<br/><br/>On the other hand, I'm strongly considering buying TSOY. I have read the free html version, but I KNOW that if I want to run the game, I will need an actual book in the gaming table. The same could be said about almost any other game, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70735/#Comment_70735" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T07:16:44+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  7:16AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2007 7:17AM by orklord.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Selfish plug warning:</b><br/>I've struggled with the idea of downloaded pdfs and used books.  My cohorts and I discussed this on the 6th episode of Canon Puncture Podcast. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/canonpuncture" rel="nofollow">Check out the show</a>.<br/><br/>I discuss my feelings about buying used copies of Sorceror books and we migrate to pdfs.  Honestly, we don't get deep into the warez discussion, so the episode is more of a companion to this discussion (okay, maybe a sickly companion, but allow me some puffery).<br/><br/>Over the years, I've downloaded out of print Dungeon mags that I already own and some I saw in an index and thought it might have a cool adventure in it.  I've downloaded some other books for a look see, but as I stated in the podcast, I get this sickly feeling with small press downloads that I don't with larger RPG companies, esp those with $40 books.  I really, <i>really </i>have to be interested in a book to pay $40 for it.

Most often, when you buy a print copy, you get the PDF version either free or for a nominal additional charge. This makes the game very easy to use for those of us who use computers a lot for prep &amp; reference purposes, or who like to hack rules/setting/etc. I have dl'd D&amp;D stuff in the past, and probably will again, simply because it's not available legally as a PDF for a competitive price and I don't want to pay twice for the same content in two formats. Being able to quickly and conveniently create handouts, copy text into Word and hack it up, build custom versions of a game... these are important to me, and PDF makes them possible. Having a book I can curl up with, carry on the train, lend to a friend, pass around the table, hit people over the head with... these also are important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70744/#Comment_70744" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T08:01:23+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  8:01AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2007 8:08AM by Mark_Causey.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is another site for pirating RPGs in case people want to check on their games.<br/><br/><a href="http://chaos-wasteland.enlightning.de:6969" rel="nofollow">chaos-wasteland.enlightning.de:6969</a><br/><br/>EDIT: Linked directly to tracker<br/><br/>You may have to have a login for this, I dunno.<br/><br/>Fred: <a href="http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:e0PObfR3NYoJ:cw.enlightning.de:6969/index.html%3Fmode%3DUnseeded+cw.enlightning.de:6969+spirit+century&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">You've been pirated since 04/27</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70755/#Comment_70755" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T08:30:25+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  8:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The copy of Godlike that's floating around is some kind of pre-published pdf which I found strange(lots of ''look at page xx'' and ''block text here'' and no art).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70782/#Comment_70782" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T10:18:58+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 10:18AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: elmago79</cite>I've been having a lot of (small) success spreading the FATE gospel using the SRD, not here, in Mexico (I would be the South-American student from the example) but in Spain and Finland.</blockquote>\n"Not here, in Mexico, but in Spain and Finland."<br/><br/>Not on topic, but that is the coolest damn thing I've heard all week.

I'd heard about it through various forums and had been meaning to check it out for a while, but without a credit card, buying the books would have been work and so I just asked people on the froum about what this game is like and so on. (Obviously, this was before Wushu Open.)<br/><br/>One fellow forum user offered me a bunch of files from Dan, amongst them the Wushu core, various Guides and a few other things from bayn.org. (I have no idea where he got them from, but I assume he bought them.) I accepted, read thzem and was instantly hooked.<br/><br/>Since then, my girlfriend got herself a credit card and so I could finally buy stuff over the internet, and I used it to buy practically everything Daniel Bayn published since then, from Wire-Fu to the Tempus Guides. (I also bought Roanoke. ^_^) <br/><br/>Now, I sometimes download stuff to check it out and to see if I like it. (If that's the case, I'll buy it.) I also downloaded Nobilis even though I already have the GWB, so see how good the scan was and to use for handouts.

One person came on and said "someone post a torrent of this game so I can download it for free just to piss this jerk off".<br/><br/>That's the kind of stuff I hate. That's the kind of stuff that gives filesharing a bad name. That's the kind of stuff that makes me not want to offer PDF's at all. <br/><br/>On the oetehr had, I don't have any problem with someone buying one of my PDFs and sending it to a friend. I don't even really have a problem with someone downloading the book off a filesharing site. I might raise a fuss about it, but in my heart of hearts I really don't care.<br/><br/>What I do care about is the mentality that I've seen developing where downloaders act as if they are entitled to everything for free. This sin't something I see here, but in other communities. The idea that everything should be available for free and anyone trying to sell something is a jerk or an asshole and is open to attack. I find this attitude repulsive and.... I don't have word for it. It kills me a little bit.<br/><br/>What I'm seeing here is a lot more acceptable to me. I don't believe for a minute that everyone who dopwnl;oads a product that they really like will pay for it anyway. That's just not true. I've stolen enough stuff to know it. I do thank that some people work like that. I also think that there are plenty of people who are happy to get something that they want and will use for free. I don't really blame them for this. I put my PDF's out there knowing that. I do think that some good word of mouth advertising can come out of something like this. I think you can build a fan base for later releases. I think that someone who got your PDF for free might be more inclined to buy a print copy of your book if they see it in a shop. I also think that these people are far outnumbered by people who want your game and don't want to pay for it. And these people are far outnumbered by people who just want your game because they can take it and it makes them feel good to hurt someone.<br/><br/>But we all make a choice when we make our games available in any format. We don't go into this blind.

At least some of those people, or other people exposed to the illegal download end up buying the product. Certainly not all people do that. The fact that the PDF sales of a game are bigger than just one unit (contrast it Windows Vista sales on China) means a lot of people do want to buy it.

I'm not completely convinced that having the PDF pirated was a win situation for us. It certainly didn't turn out badly. We're styill in business and Panty Explosion still sells well. But I've had people tell me that the copy of the game they own is one they downloaded for free, and that they don't see a good reason to buy a hardcopy or pay for the PDF. I've also had people tell me that they downloaded the game for free then bought it at a retail store later when they came across it. So it's hard for me to tell. Reports of the former outweigh reports of the later, but not by much. there has definetly been an increase in positive word of mouth about the game. and while sales did slump for awhile, they did eventually go back up. At the moment I put the whole thing in the "no harm done" catagory, but it's hard for me to say.<br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AdamK" title="AdamK"><img alt="AdamK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AdamK">AdamK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71269/#Comment_71269" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T03:27:52+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  3:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's good for Microsoft not because they sell more copies to the people who pirate their OS.

Not only that, but in times where some competition actually existed (amiga, os/2, and so on) it helped smash it; microsoft has the advantage that the os hooks you into a specific market (you are going to need other products in the future, and guess what, they'll run on ms only). And uses very strong lock-in tactics. Nowadays, the market is already in ms hands, and that's why it is a bit more difficult to circumvent the protections.<br/><br/>Games are a different beast, though: the only system that has (imo) something similar to the "vendor lock-in" spurred by not wanting to change system is dnd/d20. A lot of people started with dnd, learned that, and don't want to try anything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71273/#Comment_71273" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T03:56:44+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  3:56AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the piracy argument comes down to this:<br/><br/>If you have a desirable product, it <b>will</b> be pirated.  If you make music, people will rip your CDs and upload the resulting MP3 or FLAC files to usenet or a P2P network.  If you make a film, people will rip a DVD or just film the damn thing in a cinema with a camcorder and it'll appear on P2P.  If you write a piece of software, someone will crack it and sell CDs on ebay.  If you make running shoes, a sweat shop in china will make near identical pairs and sell them around the world for a fraction of the cost you sell yours for and you will not see a penny of that money.<br/><br/>Thinking there's anything you can do to prevent your product getting pirated is incredibly naive.  Like it or not, P2P and Piracy is here to stay.  The music and movie industries can't stop it, so what chance does the RPG industry have?<br/><br/>Various studies have shown some facts about online piracy: Most of the people who download don't read or use any of what they download and wouldn't have bought the product anyway.  Some people download to try stuff out and buy the stuff they like.  And, yeah, some people who used to buy stuff stopped when they started downloading.  So undoubtedly, there are sales lost to piracy (although there's a strong argument to suggest that also sales are made due to piracy).  Do people lose sleep over the idea that their games are pirated?  Probably.  Does that do any good, is there anything anyone can do about it?  Not that I can see.  Before P2P, people used to just steal books from the damn shop!  I guess that hit the retailer rather than the publisher, and obviously it wasn't on the same scale as P2P.  But still, a dishonest person who's determined will get what they want without paying.<br/><br/>What a publisher <b>can</b> do to reduce piracy is perhaps make it easier for people to get their work legitimately.  Make a PDF available, otherwise people who want a PDF will have no choice but to pirate the game.  Make that PDF cheap, otherwise people have more incentive to pirate it.  Make cheap delivery possible on shipped items (Offer the "slow. but cheap" option where possible), because most people would rather have the dead tree edition of something and the PDF is not as good to those people.  Like it or not, people can, with very little effort, get your game as a PDF for free.  You have to work around that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Spirit of the Century gets Pirated.

Nice summary.<br/><br/>I'll add: don't use DRM or copy protection mechanisms. They only harm those willing to pay, and do nothing to stop the pirates. RPG writers already get this, but it's good to keep in mind.<br/><br/>Make your game affordable enough and the buying process easy enough, and lots of people will pay: look at iTunes. You could just as easily find the songs on emule... but still, the store sells millions of songs. They're cheap, it's easy to buy and pay, and the drm is reasonable, afaik.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71287/#Comment_71287" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T05:28:19+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  5:28AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Jake, (sorry, quote appears to be broken for me right now)<br/><br/>If you don't mind me asking: Of the people who email you and say they downloaded your PDF without paying and have no intention of ever paying for it, how many say if they liked it or not?<br/><br/>Because, y'know, if someone says "I DLed yr gaem and its teh 5uxx0r!!!11!!" that very different from "I downloaded your game from Demonoid and thought it was great.

We get a lot of  "I DLed yr gaem and its teh 5uxx0r!!!11!!" type email anyway, mostly from self identified D&amp;D players who get it to show their friends so they can laugh at it together. Suprisingly, some ofthese people actually buy it just for this reason. I suspect other buy it because they actually want it, but hide that from their friends when they start to make fun of them for wanting to "pretend to be a girl". <br/><br/>Ugh.<br/><br/>Anyway, I do get a lot of emails from people who say they downloaded the game from Demonoid or 4chan or somewhere and they just needed to let me know that I'm a really awful person. They don't like the game because it doesn't have it points or a combat system. Or because you can only play girls. Or they didn't bothe rto read it because they hate the name. People go out of their way to tell me how much they hate the name Panty Explosion. Something about the name drives people nuts. They'll steal it, but they won't read it because of the name.<br/><br/>The flip side of that is the people who download it and say they like it. They email me and ask questions, make suggestions or say other things that fall into the nice catagory. A few times people have emailed to say that they downloaded the game from a site, liked it and decided that they should let me know which site they got it from. Some of these people have said that they never intend to buy a copy. Some have said they might.<br/><br/>Now really, I've only had maybe (maybe) 30-40 people ever contact me and say they swiped the game. To me this seems like a huge amount, but really that's not a lot. A lot of those were in direct response to my very vocal  complaints on several different download sites back when PE was first pirated, so I don't thin that this 30-40 people represents a much, much larger number of people who downloaded the game and actually read it. <br/><br/>But yeah, even the people who said they liked it and might buy a copy at some point... well, who knows? <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm pretty raw on this at the moment because I ad a run in with someone yesterday who had set up a rapidshare with both my games. When I contacte hiom about it and asked him to remove the file he told me that I was an asshole for actuyally trying to charge people for my games and if I didn't want people to steal my stuff I shouldn't make it in the first place. This kind of stuff gets me pretty worked up, but I should apologize for using Fred's thread to vent on it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71295/#Comment_71295" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T05:46:55+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  5:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>What a publisher<b>can</b>do to reduce piracy is perhaps make it easier for people to get their work legitimately.

Make cheap delivery possible on shipped items (Offer the "slow. but cheap" option where possible), because most people would rather have the dead tree edition of something and the PDF is not as good to those people.

PDFs are priced lower than printed books. That's good, because they honestly have less utility to me, so I wouldn't even think of buying them otherwise. Nobody's being an idiot and overcharging for a less-useful format like they tried to do with e-books.<br/>2. PDFs can be bundled with printed books for only $5 or $10 extra. I'm not being charged the cost of two books if I want to get one book in two formats.<br/>3. No stupid DRM shit you can't use, no aggressive watermarking, &amp;c. The message I get when I buy a PDF is "you're a customer" rather than "you're a potential criminal," and that makes me want to <i>buy more stuff</i>.<br/>4. Creators who don't want their stuff being pirated <b>speak up</b> and say "No, dude, that's not cool with me" instead of hiding behind DRM (which doesn't work). The message here isn't "stop, you're a criminal" but "stop, I'm a person!" (Jake gets props here.)<br/>5. Some people are doing the Creative Commons, OGL, free demo, &amp;c. thing. There are enough of those people in the community that you can introduce others to the overall idea of indie RPGs without asking them to shell out any cash before they even know what the heck any of this stuff is.

Really. You're breaking a commandment and since the Vatican said that there's no more Limbo, you'll pay for your sins in Hell. Maybe you downloaded the game for the kick or maybe you didn't have money. Since you're not starving and this isn't food, it doesn't matter. It's Hell for you.<br/><br/>BUT, I might be able to put a good word on your behalf IF you do the following: Demo my game 10 times and send me the reports and comments of the players by email. (Yes, email. You found my game on the net, surely you can find my contact email address.) Depending on the quality of your submissions I MIGHT even consider your debt paid and, if asked (or not), you MUST say that you got the game from me (yes, I know it's a lie but since I'm asking you, I'll bear the brunt of that sin; remember, it's your soul at stake here) and send them to my website - you don't want your friends going to hell, do you?"<br/><br/>Most won't do it, of course.

If I like the game, I'll usually buy a print copy. If no print copy is available, I'll usually buy the PDF, even though I already have a PDF (albeit an illegal copy). If I don't care for it, I'll delete it after a while (I don't hoard useless RPG PDFs). <br>\n<br>\nI have never played in or run a game where I used an illegal copy. If I decide to use a product as a player or GM, I always purchase it.<br>\n<br>\nIf I'm interested in a gaming product, I like to preview it first. With many products, I can go to Barnes and Noble, get a coffee, sit down in a comfy chair and read game books until my heart's content. I can literally spend an entire day reading a game book without purchasing it. I like previewing stuff before I buy. <br>\n<br>\nSome companies have PDF trial versions of their games which serve the same purpose, like HARP, Savage Worlds, GURPS, and T20 to name a few. This satisfies my preview curiosity sufficiently. Some companies even have entire games available as free PDFs. I have purchased a large amount of Eden Studios product simply based on my love of the Witchcraft PDF. The complete PDF of the game is available as a free download on the company's website (of course, I liked it so much I had to buy a print copy).<br>\n<br>\nPutting a disclaimer in a book telling people they will do to hell for downloading the product is pretty much guaranteed career suicide. Even if it was intended in jest, it is in such poor taste that no amount of backpedaling will help the publisher save face.<br>\n<br/>\nEven saying something like "you've taken a fairly large chunk of money out of my pocket" makes me shake my head. The only way I'm going to buy your product is if I can check it out first. If I can't look at it in the store or download a PDF, I wont buy your product. If I can check it out before I buy, there is a good chance I'll purchase a copy. Therefore, in my case, the statement is completely false. If I can't download first, then you've prevented a large chunk of money from going into your pocket. If I do download, there might be a good chunk of money heading to your pocket. Ergo statements like the one above just sound silly to me, and would make it hard for me to take the publisher seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a reasonable disclaimer would be something like "If you have obtained this copy illegally via file sharing or another means, please consider purchasing a legitimate copy from mygamestore.com and help support the product line. Thanks!"<br/>\n<br/>\nI know small press writers and publishers pour a lot of their heart and soul into a game and have a lot of emotional investment. I can understand how they would feel very angry at seeing their products scattered about the internet illegally. My gut reaction tells me that PDF file sharing generates more revenue than it prevents.  The likelihood of preventing file sharing is pretty low also, and so I think the only reasonable thing is to keep a level head and try to look at it in a positive light.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few possible ways to combat the problem, if you do see it as a problem:<br/>\n- Produce a free trial PDF or lite version of the game. Make sure it has enough content to be playable. <br/>\n- Make sure your products are easily accessible to the public to purchase. Make sure customers have more than one option for purchasing your product. I love IPR, but maybe someone has had a bad experience and won't shop there - can they get your game somewhere else? POD is becoming popular and lulu.com is an option. There are several stores that specialize in gaming PDFs and so there are a lot of options open to publishers.<br/>\n- If you are worried about file sharing, you could only release the product in print (although someone will eventually scan the book and share it anyway).<br/>\n- Keep PDF price points reasonable. Personally, I think most PDFs are priced a little too high compared with print versions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think a war on file-sharing is something game publishers are going to win. There are, however, upsides to the situation and one simply has to make the best of things.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71977/#Comment_71977" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-26T09:12:53+00:00" title="May 26, 2007  9:12AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2007 9:13AM by Ben_Lehman.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>My gut reaction tells me that PDF file sharing generates more revenue than it prevents.</i><br/><br/>It's not that I disbelieve you, here, that this is your gut feeling.

I'd like to think it's the other way around - my actions are based on my gut feeling, that I wouldn't download if I really believed it was hurting publishers. What came first, the chicken or the egg? Who knows.<br/><br/>However, lacking any hard data, it's unfortunately difficult to "critically" know what is correct or not, and all we are left with is our gut feelings.<br/><br/><i>I have a different gut feeling about piracy from you: I think that it's basically a wash in terms of cash flow but it is tremendously disrespectful. </i> <br/><br/>I can empathize with how you feel. I'll bet there are people out there who download PDFs and run games without ever buying anything, and that has got to be frustrating and insulting. There are also those who buy books and PDFs based on downloads they've seen, in which case it's like free advertising.<br/><br/>On a tangent, it makes me wonder what authors feel about libraries (and yes, many libraries carry RPGs). Do authors get upset at people reading their works without paying in these instances? Does Dan Brown get upset when I check The Davinci Code out from the library? Maybe. Just a random thought.<br/><br/><i>Critically, my gut feeling is probably based in the fact that I don't like PDFs at all.</i><br/><br/>I can't stand PDFs either, and always purchase the print option if I have a choice. It always makes me shake my head in disbelief that people actually run and play games based only on pdf copies of rules. Having an honest to goodness bound, printed copy is infinitely more rewarding in my experience. This may also be contributing to my "gut feeling".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71990/#Comment_71990" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-26T14:09:50+00:00" title="May 26, 2007  2:09PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex</cite>The message I get when I buy a PDF is "you're a customer" rather than "you're a potential criminal,"</blockquote>\nWhenever I buy a DVD that has one of those annoying "You wouldn't pirate/download illegally," I get sorely tempted to rip it so that I can remove that insulting, unskippable intro.  It's one of the most disrepectful things I've seen a business do to the consumer (not counting those that would cause health concerns), and it's got a bit of irony:  those that pirate it don't have to deal with it, but those that don't have to every time they pop the disc in.<br/><br/>Treat the PDF viewer like a customer, and you won't alienate people.  Treat them like a potential criminal you're trying to dissuade, and you will.  Granted, a note in the book isn't an annoying and mandatory as the DVD intro (though some would argue that a watermark is), but you don't want to encourage people to pirate your material based on a sense of challenge (hey, I wonder if I can get around this DRM) or outrage (geez, another damned "You wouldn't steal" intro!).<br/><br/>I kinda like what Ken Hite put in Dubious Shards.  On page three, the "Acknowledgments and Clear Credit" page, he put at the end of the last paragraph "If you pirate this book, you're not just stealing from me, you're taking food out of the bowl of my cat.  And we all know what happens to people who do that, in Ulthar and anywhere else."  But, while it's subtle and I think non-insulting, I also don't think it's particularly useful.  It's tucked away in a part of the book that I suspect a lot of people don't bother reading.  Those who buy it &amp; read it maybe get a chuckle, and those who pirate have that favorite argument of "It's not a physical thing to steal, so you're getting/losing the same amount of money (i.e. none) whether I simple don't get your product at all of if I pirate my copy."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72065/#Comment_72065" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-27T15:15:46+00:00" title="May 27, 2007  3:15PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A few possible ways to combat the problem, if you do see it as a problem:<br/>- Produce a free trial PDF or lite version of the game.

You can download the article here (dirct link):<br/><a href="http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf</a>\n<blockquote><cite>The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales An Empirical Analysis*. Dated March 2004</cite><br/>Abstract<br/>A longstanding economic question is the appropriate level of protection for intellectual property. The Internet has drastically lowered the cost of copying information goods and provides a natural crucible to assess the implications of reduced protection. We consider the specific case of file sharing and its effect on the legal sales of music. A dataset containing 0.01% of the world\xe2\u20ac\u2122s downloads is matched to U.S. sales data for a large number of albums. To establish causality, downloads are instrumented using technical features related to file sharing, such as network congestion or song length, as well as international school holidays. Downloads have an effect on sales which is statistically indistinguishable from zero, despite rather precise estimates. Moreover, these estimates are of moderate economic significance and are inconsistent with claims that file sharing is the primary reason for the recent decline in music sales.</blockquote>\nI know of a number of people that have pirated pdfs, and one of the reasons offered up is that of convenience. They like the hard-copy of a book to take to the table, but they like the ability to print specific pages, or pop it open on their computer while doing other stuff. There's a strong feeling of "well, I already game them my money" so as far as they're concerned, they haven't stolen anything. Any more than if they photocopied this or that page. Not a lot of "sharing" goes on, just a book here or another one there. Nothing publically posted.<br/><br/>There seems to be a feeling of it being a victim-less crime. White Wolf books and WotC books being pirated the most, and the overall feeling is that they're large companies, so someone posting this or that book isn't a big deal. Especially since they buy X number of books anyways, and they're just not interested in [book Y]. Of course, [book Y] is going to vary for people so there's this murky shifting of who's buying what books, and every book has someone that's buying it, and someone else that's pirating it.<br/><br/>Poke around someplace like alt.binaries.e-book.rpg (or some equivalent thereof, depending on your ISP or whatever) and it seems like a lot of what people are after is older stuff. Lots of TSR stuff for example, old White Wolf stuff, and so forth.<br/><br/>I think some of what motivates it is the collector mentality ("This'll be a great reference!") and some is that of "need" ("I need [book y] to make an effective character for [system z]")<br/><br/>I don't really know that there's a solution, other than trying to do something like the Recording Industry is. Some luck might be had by contacting the sites that host torrents or ed2k links, and informing them that they're hosting copyright material and they're in violation. Of course, that's only really applicable if the site in question is located in the U.S. or some other country that strongly favors corporate/IP rights of one sort or another. For example, the Pirate Bay ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay</a>) has had a number of threats and even some attempted legal action, but because it's a matter of law and its interpretation and how it applies internationally, they're still up and running.<br/><br/>On a positive but only tangentally related note:<br/>I was _extremely_ pleased to get the pdf and book combination for Spirit of the Century during their pre-order. Looking back at their site, I'm seeing options for getting the pdf extremely cheaply, or even cheaper if you buy it as part of a bundle. I _really_ like that. When I buy a pdf, I'm not willing to spend more than half the cover price of a hard-copy book, without a _really_ good reason. Especially becasue (to my way of thinking), once the electronic version is done, that's pretty much it. Only in rare cases is there going to be updates made to it. Mostly it just sits around and waits to be bought. No printing cost on the part of the company selling the pdf, unless they're doing POD printing, and then you pay for the printing. If I'm willing to buy a book in hard-copy, I'm frequently going to find it extremely handy to have access to an electronic version of it as well. Kudos for offering several different options that make sense to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/binarysins" title="binarysins"><img alt="binarysins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/binarysins">binarysins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72481/#Comment_72481" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T15:11:50+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  3:11PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2007 3:14PM by binarysins.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm doing a research paper on Internet piracy, specifically music, and here's the rundown from several studies that I've read:<br/><br/>1) Piracy hurts the music industry financially. It is undeniable.<br/>2) Piracy mostly hurts close to the top 25% best selling artists. That hurt accounts for much of the financial damage done to the industry.<br/>3) Piracy *helps* the remainder of the artists or at least has no impact on their sales at all.<br/>4) The "social welfare" benefit (as in, the fact that the music is more widely available with piracy than without) outstrips the financial damage. If you monetize it, for every $20 of financial damage there is a $75 benefit to society as a whole (that figure I pulled out of my ass, but I think it's close). That can be many things - for each $20 CD that someone downloads, they purchase three more. Whether it's for the same band or different bands is another matter entirely. In fact, studies show that people who download pirated music tend to purchase legal copies of music for friends and relatives as gifts (stigma against giving someone a burned CD for Christmas?).<br/><br/>Now, RPG publishing is an entirely different animal than the music industry, but I assume that some parallels will be in there. The poster upstream who gave the breakdown of how and who and why people pirate nailed it. I'm on 4chan, and on /tg/ I tell people all the time when they ask for a small press game rapidshare to just buy it. I know they won't, but still. I've been given the royal 4chan treatment for my views, too, but I don't give a shit about that either. I've reported torrents for games that I like. Other product - such as White Wolf or WoTC games, there's no point - the torrents are out there, and they be huge (13+ GB), and they will never go away. Just like Microsoft trying to stop piracy of Vista (which did not work, the current piracy method involves tricking Vista into thinking its installed on a prebuilt machine like a Dell, which sidesteps activation completely).<br/><br/>EDIT: I won't post it here, but there is a torrent tracker specifically for RPGs. I've seen all kinds of stuff pass through there, including small press games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72487/#Comment_72487" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T15:58:06+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  3:58PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a follow up here, my experiment was sucesful and ''Panty Explosion'' is no longer available at Demonoid.
