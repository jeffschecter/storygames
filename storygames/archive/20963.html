Not exactly back into posting or commenting regularly but just had some free time today and thought it could be nice to share a couple of things and see if someone here has some extra advice I could use. Having attained some peace of mind in regards of what system I'm more happy using and how to properly use it with my group, I turned now into how to make my prep better, faster, more efficient, fun and less like a chore.<br/><br/>-Brainstorming the setting with the players in the first session is a blast! I keep it down to 8 questions and some dice rolling for the players, so it doesn't take more than 20 mins. No need to spoil them the fun of discovering the setting, as whatever they create is what their characters know about the place and thus, possibly not the exact truth! It's up to them to find about it, as I always warn them up front.<br/><br/>-After players are done making with their characters stats and skills I ask them about their choices and add more stuff to the setting based on their answers. Does wonders to create bonds, when players get a blank page syndrome on that regard. What are elves like on this world? How many orcs are out there and how are they organized? If whatever the players say sound too far-fetched or plain munchkinism I have them roll a die to determine how exact is that affirmation.<br/><br/>-Asking my group of players what does their group of PCs do, is a must. Having them decide a common objective instead of pushing one in front of them motivates them better. Also, everyone at the table wants to start playing right away, so why bother now doing scenes of how everyone met and risking splitting the party, PvP and/or someone hoarding the spotlight while the rest play with their smartphones?. We can do those scenes later as a flashback whenever someone is late for the session, among those who already came.<br/><br/>-Tavern is now our word for "place and moment where players brainstorm possible quests". I give each player a couple of random words, like a theme and an adjective for inspiration and let them come up with a rumour they hear at the tavern. Then players choose which one sounds more interesting and finally I present them a proper plot hook for it.<br/><br/>-I learned how to play unsafe, do impro a lot and have fun doing it. I steal whatever the players say (usually as a joke) and use it as if it were always part of my prep. 2d characters, pitiful and cliche villains are okey. Actually, they are a must. Not everyone needs to be a deep/complex character to be memorable. Simple plots that run for one session work better than twisted ones that last for the whole campaign, specially when you aren't playing daily or even once each week. Even plot holes get forgotten from one week to another, so why obsess about it?<br/><br/>-I don't fudge rolls nor railroad anymore; though after players have stated what they want to do and where they want to go on the next session, I make my prep focusing on what they said. Impro is okey, but nothing beats thinking about something cool to present to the players, write it down and study it for a bit before the session. Not all the material you present to the players needs to be of shakespearean quality but having a good one-liner prepared makes a world of difference sometimes.<br/><br/>-Speaking of which, right now I even get to write songs here and there. I'm no singer, but having a NPC rap a few short stupid lines beats having to read a whole exposition the players won't probably remember the next week.<br/><br/>-I'm used now to spin new scenes based on the consequences of the PC actions. From simply how the NPCs react to them to how a new enemy is born from the ashes of the last dungeon/tavern they trashed. <br/><br/>-I'm having lots of fun using all kind of music and images I find on the web for inspiration. I check Pinterest and Youtube more often than the monster manual, though it doesn't means this last one doesn't see use. Pics of both monsters, PCs, NPCs, places and even whole scenes are totally useful. Recurrent characters deserve printing their image on a card that you can stick on your DM screen for the players to see and remember who's on the scene right now. For the rest I just use my tablet to show it to the players.<br/><br/>-This mixes with being able to come up with quick stats and attacks for monsters and NPCs: I can stop limiting myself to creatures in the MM or pre-made modules. I can get creative about what can the thing in the pic I show to the players do, based on it's aspect and maybe a couple more ideas.<br/><br/>-Props that players can interact with are the best. either something they can hold while roleplaying, minis and terrain or puzzles that need some sort of interaction. It doesn't need to be complex nor detailed, it just needs to be there, if possible.<br/><br/>-I'm trying now applying the 5-room dungeon prep trick into the whole session. The action doesn't always happen in a dungeon, but 5 scenes seem to be a good number of things to happen on a single session, as more scenes take forever to play, in our group experience. On the players whim, a single scene can take forever or end up taking the action to a different unexpected place. But there are plenty more different ways of preparing the adventure, it can be a single massive battle, a chase, a puzzling crime, plain travelling from one place to another, etc.<br/><br/>-I found it's good to include at least two encounters. One can (and will) get skipped by the party by being stealthy or talking their way out of it, or perhaps using extremely good unexpected tactics or item/spell use. A session without a single combat is perfectly possible and players making a combat out of anything isn't rare, but with two prepped you're perfectly good to go.<br/><br/>-Have everything you prepped ready for the session, from the music you found on youtube (already loaded and having skipped the ads), images you want to show the players (in order if possible), monster stat blocks to the minis and terrain you will use in combat. Every single second you waste looking for anything the chances the players get distracted increase considerably, and you lose whatever emotional momentum you could have built up to there.<br/><br/>-Which takes me to another particular on my prep: my notes should be brief enough so I can find quickly whatever I want. So its bullet points and three lines stat blocks at best. A map if I get to draw one (either a relationship or dungeon), in one-room pieces if I have to show it to the players instead of drawing it on the board for them. The longer or more detailed the notes the worse, as interrupting myself to read them while playing often stalls the game a bit and potentially ruins the atmosphere.<br/><br/>-And finally, I don't try to do all this for every session. For some just generic background music, no props and winging all the combat is okay, it's good when I can have one thing or other ready but having fun myself is one of my main concerns along with sharing fun with my group of players.<br/><br/>So, any other ideas? How do you like to have fun while GMing or prepping? How far have you gone with prep and what do you think was your best discovery about it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460010/#Comment_460010" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T00:13:16+00:00" title="February  7, 2017 12:13AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2017 12:13AM by Deliverator.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>-I'm having lots of fun using all kind of music and images I find on the web for inspiration.

This means that they sound appropriately exotic. Sometimes I skip the next name if it doesn't fit the NPC, so I don't limit myself to using them in order. The one drawback is that I've mostly used single names for NPCs, so I think I will start picking two names to create a surname as well.<br/><br/>- Video game music is better than film music to use as background. I've used the Assassin's Creed soundtracks lately; one game per adventure, so ten or more sessions. This way we get a slightly different mood depending on if the video game takes place in an Eastern setting or in Venice Film music is usually very uneven, so you have silent parts and then sudden increases in volume, which makes it hard to keep an even volume. Video game music is created to stay in the background as you explore, which is perfect.<br/><br/>- I brought a large notebook that we use to chronicle what happens in game. This is the players' rotating responsibility, as I don't have time to write when I'm running the game. I never decide who's turn it is to write, but tell the players to decide. I made it clear that the level of detail is up to the current player to decide, so some write more and some less. It's nice to be able to go back and see what treasures they found or when the unidentified magic sword was discovered, because they don't always find everything in the written modules. At the start of each session, the new chronicler usually reads the last paragraph out loud so that we all know where we left off. My inspiration for the chronicle, and I sent the link to my players, was this: <a href="http://www.joelsartore.com/story-behind/madidi-diary/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.joelsartore.com/story-behind/madidi-diary/</a><br/><br/>- I've gotten a small pocket calendar (for 2017, but whatever) that I use to record things in game on the correct in-game date. We already have this in the chronicle, but I want to keep track of the weather and other small things. In the system I use now, weather is randomized each day, but can only shift one step at a time in the table, so I need to know the weather the day before. I also write a single word or two if they have an encounter or find a special item, so that I can know for example how fast the news that the orcs have been killed will spread to their leader.<br/><br/>- Almost all rolls and game stats are in the open, just because it's more tense that way. Especially rolls that directly affect PCs are rolled by the player, after making sure that everyone knows just how important this save vs death roll really is. Well, I roll damage for monsters, but I like to know the PC's HP first and will usually ask, because it's more tense to know before the roll that they have 3 HP left than the player saying "oh, I'm down!" out of the blue after the roll. I say "almost" all rolls, because I've very rarely been rolling behind my screen, but I can't remember what for. I roll monster HP in the open the first time they are hit, so that the players know if they're fighting a HD 2, 4, or 8 monster. Up until the first damage, they depend on my descriptions, but then they know for sure. I don't keep exact HP in the open as combat continues, but I don't stop the players from keeping track of special monsters if they like. Knowing that the monster has 3 HP left, but so do you, can create tense situations.<br/><br/>- My players are helpful, and I've learned to delegate hosting tasks to speed up setting up and clearing the play space. They usually volunteer, otherwise I ask players to wipe the whiteboard, collect all dice (only one player brings his own, otherwise we use mine), collect character sheets (I keep them between sessions), clean up candy wrappers, and so on. We only play for three hours each time after work, so it's nice to be able to play until the last minute and then quickly clean everything up together, instead of the players waiting around for me to finish everything. This is of course common courtesy, but I think all GMs can be helped by delegating some tasks to the players.<br/><br/>- Something I want to start to use, but haven't yet, is to use the memory palace method to memorize dungeons and other locations. By walking through the dungeon in my mind before the session, I can visualize where monsters are located and will have a better grasp of whether they will hear a fight or not, what they will see, and so on. My ideal is to keep prep low though to keep things fresh, because I don't want to spend too much time between sessions "working" on the game and risk burnout. But I think that the memory palace idea would be so useful that I'll try it for the next session as I read through the room descriptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/empowermint" title="empowermint"><img alt="empowermint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/empowermint">empowermint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460030/#Comment_460030" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T15:48:20+00:00" title="February  7, 2017  3:48PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be really interested to hear if the memory palace idea works out.

To work as an effective long-term memorisation technique, I think you'd have to use a real-life location you know well and peg in things which remind you of the layout of the fictional location.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460034/#Comment_460034" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T16:56:15+00:00" title="February  7, 2017  4:56PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I want you to know, this paragraph inspired me to finally get a tablet.

I do have a PC on the same room we use so whenever we need music we use it instead. But since the screen is behind me, facing the players and it isn't big enough, it doesn't work too well for me to keep my notes there.\n<blockquote><br/>I would say this is the thing I still sometimes struggle with the most, particularly when running heavy games like 5E or Burning Wheel.

Having everything at hand and reduced to a couple of lines of notes for each scene is what works best for heavy games. Not to mention that it's quite helpful to be able to work on your prep anywhere. <br/><br/>Yet I don't reccomend to use the tablet to visualize your prep in the google doc: the tablet screen will go off after a few seconds without use and you will again lost several seconds turning it back on and scrolling for the information. Nothing beats printing your google doc and having it in front of you when DMing. But for showing things to your players, the next best thing is probably connecting the tablet/smartphone with a big digital tv in the room, using bluetooth. If there's one available, of course.<br/><br/>For the tablet option, you can download the pinterest app, and make separate folders of images for different places or factions. Depending on the speed of your wi-fi and the tablet specs, it may be okay or make you want to download the actual images on your pc and upload them directly to your tablet before the session, which is what I'm going by these days.<br/><br/>Another couple useful gadgets are your smartphone coupled with a speaker connected via bluetooth. I bought a small cheap one which I often place in front of the players, who quickly forget the thing is there after the session starts. But I don't use this thing for music (well you could use spotify with the thing too but I desisted after finding out I couldn't control the order the songs in my playlists will play without paying); I instead downloaded an app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.highfantasysoundboard&amp;hl=es_419" rel="nofollow">High Fantasy Soundboard</a> which allows you to play short sound effects like bells, wolf howls in the distance, sword clashes, a war horn and a lot more. You still have to get used to it and have it ready ahead of time, but it is a wonderful tool once you do. I keep my smartphone on the table behind my screen, so usually nobody expects me to play a frightful sound out of nowhere, like a monster growl.<br/><br/>Alas, beware that incoming calls will be heard through the speaker by everyone. I hardly get calls on sunday afternoon so I rarely have any issues, but it's a heck of a confuse moment when I do, as I have to run outside the reach of the speaker bluetooth to have a normal conversation <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>There are apps for keeping track of your character, making dungeons, keep track of the initiative and more, but for the same reason mentioned above, that the screen will go off after a few seconds, I haven't feel many of them worth using.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460037/#Comment_460037" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T17:57:20+00:00" title="February  7, 2017  5:57PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is already a brilliant list!<br/><br/>My favourite trick to create more complex NPCs on the fly is simply to make sure every character believes they are a good person.<br/><br/>Similarly, a simple way to create interesting choices in the story is just to make sure that every option has at least one upside and one downside. <br/><br/>One thing you haven't touched on at all is verbal description and roleplaying NPCs.

Glad you find it useful!<br/><br/>Ahh, I did that trick quite often, I have good memories on that. What happened to me is that I repeated the same kind of villain a bit too much. It's the same thing if you only use bi-dimensional characters and cliche villains. What works best is to have both kinds as a contrast, to keep players on their toes and not take you DMing for granted. Also, making something just for the sake of giving the players something to hit without remorse is a relaxing change of pace once in a while.<br/><br/>Ah, of course, every option has to have an upside and a downside! even if players can't tell yet if one of them is real or not; otherwise you're subtly railroading them into taking the best option... and once they get your trick they will definitely go for whatever you present as the worst option. Well, I think we all have to admit that at least once we have played with the information, it's a crucial part of our work anyway. Sometimes it makes sense for the PCs to be aware of some dangers when they take an option and sometimes it doesn't.<br/><br/>(I mean, if there's no ranger nor druid in the group, would they be aware that crossing the marshes has a downside? if they have no thief, would they know what are they getting into if they try to buy something in the black market?)<br/><br/>About verbal description, it's okey if you're not too good at it. But among the basics you certainly have to dominate are clarity and consistence. Clarity can be achieved by repeating your descriptions in different moments with different words and using gestures to communicate things like position and scale, which are really important for the players to help them decide their course of action. <br/><br/>Like, how big is the monster in front of them? If you stare at the head of the imaginary 20' tall creature as you describe it and/or gesture at how much of your visual field it occupies, players will automatically follow your cue and react accordingly. Position, direction and speed are equally important here. Where are the PC's? How fast is the enemy moving? lots of gestures can be used here, and repeating things helps to keep things crystal clear. Remember that players can't see what you're thinking until you explain it at your best.<br/><br/>For consistence you just need to trust your memory and thank players for correcting you when it fails. But curiously, what matters here is trust. Players won't notice many of the continuity mistakes (unless they are blatantly obvious and/or too soon after the first description of the scene) if you keep describing things confidently. Consistence is also about obeying and enforcing the setting logic. If "narrative" logic usually matters more (PCs find the quest giver by coincidence, they are the only ones in the ares which can do this quest, etc) why all of a sudden real logic (logistics, when do the characters go to bathroom, travel time) should matter? <br/><br/>And the answer would be: "because it's fun!" - because that's the thing you should be more consistent about. I've read hilarious anecdotes of players using real life physics calculations to determine how an scene should play, so why not? as long as it's fun for everyone in the table, of course.<br/><br/>That's it with the basics, for more advanced stuff what you need is to think of as many of your senses as you can while describing. How does this place, monster or npc smells or sounds like? how does it moves, or is there wind or anything else moving here? Focusing in an emotion works too, like, what if the monster looks sad, lonely or just confused? The villain may be bored or really glad to see things going his way. Those emotions usually permeate the whole scene and be reflected in things like weather, illumination, state of decay, colors, etc.<br/><br/>And well, knowing and using a lot of adjectives (and their synonyms) is quite useful. I'd say using a couple different adjectives is a must when describing anything. Not that you need to use both in the same prhase but using two for the same subject is enough for describing it properly. You can get into details is players look at it more closely.<br/><br/>For roleplaying I'm trying now with a single quirk for each NPC. It doesn't need to have much more than that, besides a clear objective in mind for the scene and a particular emotion if you want. Besides, it's quite hard to remember more than that for me when I roleplay the character. I find it quite hard to roleplay more than one quirk, specially if I have several NPCs in the same scene as it often happens in my game. If the NPC always shows more or less the same emotion that doubles as a quirk. So, one character can have a noticeable limp (easy to roleplay) another has a tick in the eye (easy if you don't do it too much), another may have a deep, hollow voice, etc. Players will instantly recognize them, which is the main goal here. After that it's their actions and lines which will end up making them memorable.<br/><br/>My players still remember a henchmen I made for a game many years ago, just because all the character said was "afabafa", repeating and speaking it as if everybody could understand him. They loved to talk to him for some reason :P<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460041/#Comment_460041" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T18:41:31+00:00" title="February  7, 2017  6:41PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love the rap/song idea - I'll have to try it.<br/><br/>I try to keep my NPC portrayals consistent and memorable by basing them - in my head - on an actor or character I know.

This means that they sound appropriately exotic. Sometimes I skip the next name if it doesn't fit the NPC, so I don't limit myself to using them in order. The one drawback is that I've mostly used single names for NPCs, so I think I will start picking two names to create a surname as well.<br/></blockquote>\nHell yes! The list of names is a must! Without it you are either risking having too many ridiculous immersion-breaking level names, repeating yourself from other games, using well known fantasy names that already have too much expectation attached or just taking too long to come up with something on the spot. <br/><br/>Also, that list is a good way of noticing how many characters you're using in your game. If there are up to 30 named characters in your campaign and they are all reappearing and active it's probably way too much. When you pay attention to movie scripts, you will notice main characters can be counted with your fingers, and support ones will probably appear five times in the whole movie or even less. Sure, you can describe a lot more people by quirks or put them into general groups, to give the impression the world is densely populated, but you don't need to name them all.<br/><br/>Also, from experience, try to avoid including too many NPCs with a story prepped from the start. Let players choose who they want to know more of and then make up a story for those. Prepping too much unchangeable things from the start would just lead to railroading anyway.\n<blockquote><br/>- Video game music is better than film music to use as background. I've used the Assassin's Creed soundtracks lately...<br/></blockquote>\nHahaha, funny thing, I just got the Assasin's Creed soundtrack too! Yes, movie soundtrack are often made to fit specific demands for the scenes, so it's rare for the timing of the emotions they provide to be synchronized with either combat or roleplaying. Also, most video game soundtracks are made to loop perfectly, so you can leave it in the background for a while before anyone notices.\n<blockquote><br/>- I brought a large notebook that we use to chronicle what happens in game. This is the players' rotating responsibility, as I don't have time to write when I'm running the game. I never decide who's turn it is to write, but tell the players to decide. I made it clear that the level of detail is up to the current player to decide, so some write more and some less. It's nice to be able to go back and see what treasures they found or when the unidentified magic sword was discovered, because they don't always find everything in the written modules. At the start of each session, the new chronicler usually reads the last paragraph out loud so that we all know where we left off. My inspiration for the chronicle, and I sent the link to my players, was this: <a href="http://www.joelsartore.com/story-behind/madidi-diary/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.joelsartore.com/story-behind/madidi-diary/</a><br/></blockquote>\nTotally gonna steal this. Perhaps add the calendar idea to the notebook. I've been able to manage things like variable weather, travel time and consequences, but having a more organized way to keep track of that (and one I can leave my players to take care of) can certainly be quite useful. It's too bad when you make a huge map but suddenly travelling is resumed to a single description or maybe a couple of fights with wandering monsters, you lose the feeling of exploration you could had gained taking your time on the travel or plainly taking into account how many days it actually takes to get from one place to another.\n<blockquote><br/>- Almost all rolls and game stats are in the open, just because it's more tense that way... </blockquote>\nAgreed. I do something similar, not letting players know the monster exact AC until after the first roll. Never though about rolling the HP right in that moment too, sounds reasonable, though I'm not sure how my group would take it. Maybe I'll give it a try next session. It sounds better for boss fights, actually, as rolling for a bunch of minions doesn't seem to worth the effort too much, even if you roll a single time for all of them. PCs can usually one-shot them anyway, which is the satisfactory thing about minions. But big monsters are different. It makes sense for seasoned adventurers to be able to discern how though a monster is after the first hits.<br/><br/>I also would like to see how the memory palace thing goes. Sadly my memory isn't good enough for this, so I guess I'll keep it to my notes and try studying before the game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460058/#Comment_460058" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-08T13:25:47+00:00" title="February  8, 2017  1:25PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually keep the AC kind of secret, due to the neat design of Whitehack. Each PC has an attack value which is the target to roll equal or under on 1d20 when you attack. It starts around 10, slightly different for different classes, and increases by about one per level. I don't have the tables in front of me, so this is from memory. Anyway, AC is used to block values at the lower end of the scale when you roll. Say that you have attack value 12 and attack a monster with AC 3. To hit, you need to roll equal or lower than 12, but above 3. This means that the player can roll and keep track of their attack value, and say "I rolled a 7" or "I rolled a 2" and I say "hit" or "miss". This means that they don't know the exact AC unless for example they miss on 3 and hit on 4. The players can deduce the AC from my armor description for humanoid enemies, enemies in studded leather without shields have the same AC, but it's harder to know for monsters.<br/><br/>I roll HP for each enemy the moment they take damage, which turns it into an opposed roll of sorts. First the player rolls to hit and is happy if they make it, and roll their damage, say a 4. Then there's tension again when I pick up the d6 to roll HP, because we don't know if it's going to be enough damage. I actually roll HP even if there's no chance for survival, and we let the difference between HP and damage affect the description. If a PC does 6 damage on a HD 1 orc, I'll still roll HP. If the orc had 6 HP, the hit barely killed it, but with 1 HP I might add that it looks malnourished and thin, looks young and small, or has grey hair or something.  Last session the group fought four goblins where three of them turned out to have 6 HP and one 5 HP, but most of them were rolled after being hit by 6 or more damage. It was still interesting to see what a powerful little group they were.<br/><br/>I don't find it takes a lot of time to roll these HP rolls. Quite often it's just a roll and we see right away that the monster is killed. Otherwise I scribble "orc <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> 1 HP" in my notebook to know it has 1 HP left. As I said, I don't keep this secret from the players, as I think it's a fun tactical decision if they want to finish off the 1 HP orc or attack the orc's full-health buddy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460060/#Comment_460060" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-08T15:32:29+00:00" title="February  8, 2017  3:32PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!<br/><br/>Well, one thing I learned from PbtA games is that now I never ever say "you miss". This is wasting a perfect opportunity to roleplay awesome foe reactions, instead of waiting until I roll high to do so. It usually goes like this:<br/><br/>player: I aim carefully and let loose a fire arrow at the goblin *rolls dice, 7*<br/>player: Crap, I missed!<br/>DM: You actually aimed well, what you didn't expected was for the goblin to notice your shot and parry it, fire and all!. It was part instinct and part luck... or perhaps something more. Party cleric, roll perception!<br/>cleric player: what, me? Okey... *rolls dice* that's a 15<br/>DM you feel something unnatural on that goblin, something protecting him. Then you notice a crude religious symbol hanging from his neck. Perhaps he's a fanatic follower of some dark god?<br/>cleric: I want to roll religion knowledge to see what it could be!<br/><br/>I usually try to let the dice tell me part of the story. If a monster turns out way too lucky and is able to survive a combat (I often have enemies try to escape once their numbers and resources are halved or less) then it deserves to have some more detail, maybe a more important role or even a story. Those lucky bastards are the enemies that the players will remember more anyway, and feel less imposed than the overpowered recurring villain that looks specially designed for the nemesis role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460080/#Comment_460080" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-09T06:30:49+00:00" title="February  9, 2017  6:30AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny you should mention that...

Here's a neat description: <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/shadow-mordor-nemesis-system-amazing-how-works/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gamesradar.com/shadow-mordor-nemesis-system-amazing-how-works/</a><br/><br/>I haven't played the game, so I can't say how it works in practice, but it seems like something that could be useful in table-top roleplaying games. Perhaps the fleeing orc gets some kind of bonus until next time, perhaps even leveling up an HD level? Or if the system supports it (or the GM decides to freeform it) they can get a fear of fire as in the video game article if they've been attacked with it. But I prefer the idea of making them more badass than handing out disadvantages, as the life of an orc is cheap enough as it is. It sounds much more fun if the fleeing HD 1 orc comes back with HD 2 and its own small band of HD 1 minions. The drawback is obviously that the players will learn to slaughter every last enemy and not spare anyone, so perhaps mix in that if they spare an orc it can come back and help them later. Also, charging after fleeing orcs is a great way of stepping into an ambush. It's common that orcs are viewed as irredeemably evil, and perhaps they are, but if they've been spared once perhaps they won't attack the next time they meet the PCs in the hope of being spared again? It's a riff on the idea from the video game article of controlling orcs to fight for you that could lead to fun recurring enemies, without having to actually possess them.<br/><br/>The topic of the thread is also things we'd like to learn. The modules I use for Whitehack is for a Swedish fantasy game from the 80s, and they usually have these wonderful short one-sentence backstories for random ogres or orcs that the players will never find out. Each orc has a name, and sometimes it's mentioned that this orc is extra cruel or this orc is only in it for the money. The PCs usually just kick in doors and start lopping off heads, so I don't get a chance to present this backstory. What I've been meaning to do, so far unsuccessfully, is to have enemies say oneliners as part of the combat, think Marvel comics where the combatants talk all the time. One problem is that none of the PCs speak orcish. It's fine for the orcs to speak the basic human language when they speak to the PCs, but I don't see why they would do it when they speak to each other. My options are to have them speak orcish with each other until a player gets curious enough to have their PC learn the language, or have them speak the human language with each other with some kind of in-game explanation (perhaps orcish dialects are so different that they use the human language as their shared language?). This is something I'd like to improve on: To be able to communicate the enemies' names and backstory to the players in game.<br/><br/>Each turn in Whitehack everyone gets a move action, an attack, and a speak action (or other minor things). Speaking is almost never used in our group, because the players communicate out of character what they want to do and just do it, which is fine because I don't want to limit table talk. Enemies also rarely communicate during fights, because I know what they all want to do. I want to get better at using in-game communication as part of fights, and one way is by always using the speak action for *something*, even if it's only for a grunt or a battle cry. The one time they fight silent stone golems will be much cooler for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460089/#Comment_460089" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-09T14:43:40+00:00" title="February  9, 2017  2:43PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, having the NPCs communicate during combat is definitely fun.

Think of non-verbal cues: where are they? What are they doing? What signs do they leave behind them?<br/><br/>A group of orcs keeping a careful ledger of their accumulated wealth scrawled on the wall of the cave sends a very different message than another group which wears necklaces made of human ears...<br/><br/>As for "monster legacy" - monsters developing from encounter to encounter - I think you *do* have to balanced "power-ups" with something else, or there is too much incentive for the PCs to slaughter them all.<br/><br/>Perhaps some kind of hybrid approach might be useful here. Does your game use Morale rules? If so, leverage that.<br/><br/>When you meet a monster you have faced before, roll or choose from a variety of options:<br/><br/>* The monster has developed a different tactic or approach, based on their previous encounter with the PCs. / The monster/creature has grown smarter or wiser.<br/>* The monster's Morale rating is changed appropriately: if the PCs dominated their last battle, it will be lower. (And PCs can take advantage of this further by trying to appear more frightening or with displays of power/aggression.) If the monster has a reason to feel more confident (e.g. one of the other options in this list), than the Morale rating will be higher. [Reflect this change in the monster's approach, as well. A monster who fears the PCs might show up with extra help next time, or wait behind some prepared defenses.]<br/>* The monster has developed in strength, power, or abilities.<br/>* The monster has developed a weakness or vulnerability (e.g. from a wound, or a traumatic event).<br/><br/>Some non-predictable combination of such criteria (perhaps even rolling randomly on this list of four items) could make recurring encounters really interesting and unpredictable. Some creatures or monsters will naturally turn into recurring villains, if your game culture (and rules) often creates fights which are not "to the death".<br/><br/>I think that, even, in a subtle way, players might really *enjoy* leaving enemies alive, just to see how they are different in their next encounter.<br/><br/>I always like to include something like this in my "fighty" games; it enriches every encounter and adds some spice and variety to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460097/#Comment_460097" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-09T20:10:01+00:00" title="February  9, 2017  8:10PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just readed the article and wow, those are some amazing mechanics in that game! exactly this, I love it when it happens <i>organically</i> -I never tried to teach my players to <i>spare</i> enemies, I just have enemies <i>try</i> to run away when they are outnumbered, overpowered or low on HP. I't doubles for a natural nice change of pace in a battle. If they get away, they definitely will get more prepared next time and show some background. (I just love how the game designers solved it here, weaknesses and all; those rage triggers, immunities and resistances certainly compensate for it!) <br/><br/>Enemies who hold a grudge against PCs are sure to learn some words in their language  just to curse or mock their hatred enemies better, and it's fun to roleplay how they are learning the language.<br/><br/>On the previous campaign I had the players trick a captured owlbear into running away instead of capturing them. Then later they faced a bugbear who got "promoted" for killing a couple NPCs previously. I had miscalculated that encounter difficulty so I ended up solving it in a simple way: the owlbear came back to drag away the bugbear, in revenge for imprisioning him in the first place. Of course, it was only an excuse to have that bugbear came back later... riding that same owlbear! (sadly the campaign got cancelled but the trick can be recycled anyway)<br/><br/>On some other stuff I tried, here are some of the props I ended up developing/copying after all these years of roleplaying to help me GM. Apologies for the camera quality!<br/><br/><img alt="block counters photo dungeonmat_zpsoj1btwgw.jpg" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/dungeonmat_zpsoj1btwgw.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/><br/>I was about to make my own 2.5 dungeon tiles as seen on<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/theDMsCraft/videos" rel="nofollow"> the DM craft</a> when I stumbled into a <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/dc/2b/f7/dc2bf710b45507af28d70a61dfbfe0a6.jpg" rel="nofollow">pack of counting blocks for math</a> which I found easier to paint and turn into dungeon walls and pillars.

If anything, it's better to show the image on the back of the card for the players and keep the stats for yourself on the other side. After using the tablet for showing the monsters I ended up dropping the idea, but having stat blocks written and ready is still a good practice.

We even played a session where an old adventurer trainer talked to them about all the kind of things they could do in combat besides attacking. Even seasoned players benefited from this and found it fun, to my very surprise. But well, they were new to 5e anyway.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/handout_zpsrcd7bivx.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>Dunno how many of you use the encumbrance rules, but my players and me learned to love them when <a href="http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/arts-crafts-morbidly-encumbered-edition/" rel="nofollow">I saw this</a> and made a similar sheet for them to handle their equipment weight. You just line up some squares on the sheet, mark each as 10lb worth of weight and handle a pile of small post-its to your players to write down each piece of equipment and its weight. Then watch them go insane trying to fit all their basic equipment, trying not to go over their encumbrance limit. It's lots of fun, they even complained about the basic equipment being so heavy and didn't tried to buy much else with their starting funds. Now they really appreciate "magical" equipment whose only bonus is that it's lighter than the common equipment out there.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/mas%20carga_zpsfasl5oib.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>Here are the NPC cards I wrote about before:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/npcs_zpsedqyugrp.jpg"/>The space below the image is for the character name, which I prefer to write only once the PCs learn it.<br/><br/>And this is how I put them on my DM screen:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/npcs%20en%20pantalla_zpsbbs9nbvo.jpg"/> It isn't easy to see in the crappy pic, but it's a folded piece of transparent film, stapled to make a pocket and fixed to the top of the screen with a clip.<br/><br/><br/>I had to make my own screen too, I didn't found one that suited my play style.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/pantalla_zpszajkhvxg.jpg"/><br/>that thing on the right is my initiative tracker. I bought a piece of magnetic sheet, cut a few small pieces to wrote things like PCs AC, HP, passive perception and name. Behing theres another bigger piece of magnetic sheet to hold the smaller pieces over the screen. So for each combat all I've got to do is rearrange the player order after they have rolled initiative. I don't bother to keep track of their HP, but seeing it helps me adjust how much damage should the enemies be doing, to avoid unbalanced encounters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460109/#Comment_460109" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-10T05:13:45+00:00" title="February 10, 2017  5:13AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \xa1Incre\xedble!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460110/#Comment_460110" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-10T05:20:57+00:00" title="February 10, 2017  5:20AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastico!<br/><br/>That is a wonderful pictorial overview of one incredible set of tools.

It's okay, everybody's got their own lives to live, but what I would like to do is to make that thing interesting and less immersion breaking for those who are still playing.<br/><br/>I already tried playing a flashback scene with the PCs of the present players until the rest come; it works quite fine, helps flesh the character's relationships better and keeps people focused. It only requires a bit of impro, and it doesn't even need to be way too complex. The idea there is to play the shortest one-shot you can.<br/><br/>But I'm now also thinking of how this mechanic from the Song of Ice and Fire RPG works: you got a few Destiny points you can burn for different effects, one of which is to negate character death and discuss with the GM <i>some surprising way to bring the character back from the dead at some other point of the game.</i><br/><br/>So why not? We could agree with the players that when they come and we're already playing they get to bring their character into action as soon or as log as they can make up a reasonable excuse for it. And whoever leaves early gets to describe a way their PC gets outs of scene that can be as dramatic as they can: they sacrifice for their friends and plunge into the abyss fighting the balrog, get shot and fall through a window, are teleported away by the BBEG... only to come back in an spectacular way the next session. They could leave it to the DM and the rest of the players to brainstorm the scene together once they leave, if they want to enjoy the surprise too or just have no inspiration at that moment.<br/><br/>Anybody uses anything of this sort? Have you tried and see it fail miserably?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
