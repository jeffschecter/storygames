Our big question is a rules question:<br/><br/>When cashing in an oath during an interlude to compel someone to heal you, is that their scene choice for the interlude and they can't do anything else? Is it yours? Or is it free?<br/><br/>If theirs, having high heal is a big disadvantage. If yours, okay but the text doesn't seem to indicate that. If free, the Antagonist misses a lot of strife. ?<br/><br/>Also, having high Orate and finding yourself woundless without much impairment... Is there something we're missing, or does that mean the wounded are screwed because they'll never (or not for a while) get interludes? High-orate hero can just never agree to rest...?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422715/#Comment_422715" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T16:24:44+00:00" title="October 10, 2013  4:24PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2013 4:56PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Agon-fu is a little rusty, but\u2026\n<blockquote>When cashing in an oath during an interlude to compel someone to heal you, is that their scene choice for the interlude and they can't do anything else? Is it yours? Or is it free?</blockquote>\nIt's the compelled character's action for the Interlude, but it cost an Oath. That's not a trivial price.<br/><br/>If you want to talk being an Oath magnet, try having +2 on an ability.\n<blockquote>Also, having high Orate and finding yourself woundless without much impairment...

But if one hero has no need to Interlude then they probably conserved their resources when other people were burning them. Now it's payback.

We had the helper able to help with whatever skill he chose (appropriately narrated), and the roller just got an extra die, no attached plusses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422723/#Comment_422723" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T22:36:16+00:00" title="October 10, 2013 10:36PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The plusses count. If someone uses an Oath to get you to help with an ability you have a +2 on, they get that +2 (just like if you helped yourself with that ability). The bonus applies to the highest die rolled.<br/><br/>You can help with whatever ability you can explain, based on what help the person asked for. Smart askers will try to phrase the request so you help with the ability they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422724/#Comment_422724" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T22:49:53+00:00" title="October 10, 2013 10:49PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Agon... you're so mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
