Since playing it, I've found myself more then a few times when thinking about the past or memories Braid has popped into my head with it's themes as a way of looking at how people interact with their past (or something like that).<br/><br/>So who else has played it?

The combination of the music, art style, and the very head warping alterations to time and space as a part of the gameplay are absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>Some puzzle pieces are impossible to get, but I'm waiting until I get through all the worlds once, to make sure something doesn't happen to open them up a bit more, before resorting to a help guide.

The game doesn't pretend to give the player any agency other than the ability to play. The game isn't weaker just because it's a linear experience. The game succeeds dramatically at what it is doing, and doesn't need to do anything more than that.

It's really a game that is best enjoyed from a clean slate.<br/><br/><br/>As for the controls, after the initial stage that points out the basics (jump, climb), everything else has contextual triggers. When you die, it shows you the X button so you can explore it's function. If you hold X long enough, it brings up contextual information for the left and right bumpers. That's it, until one of the later stages, which explicitly shows you the one new button it uses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170172/#Comment_170172" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T13:22:49+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  1:22PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>My main peeve is that (like many other console games*) it doesn't frakking tell you what all the controls are/do.
