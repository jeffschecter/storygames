Funny enough Paul's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.orphicinstitute.com/?page_id=65" rel="nofollow">Penny For My Thoughts</a> also benefited from this approach and also came from Master Mines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I saw Rob run Misspent Youth at various small and large conventions including Jiffycon, Camp Nerdly, Dreamation, Gencon, and Recess. And every time I see Rob at a con he's constantly seeking advice, listening, and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe bought and taught himself Indesign. He worked with <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.jenniferrodgers.com/" rel="nofollow">Jennifer Rogers </a>to build an amazing look for his game. And he did a fantastic job laying it out to be released as an Ashcan at Gencon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know what's next for Misspent Youth but I'm excited to see where it goes. Especially with all the dedication and work he has put into it. Definitely a labor of love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd love to see Rob do a "from inception to finished product" review at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you guys haven't seen it, check out Thor's amazing <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://urdwell.blogspot.com/search/label/Production" rel="nofollow">From Inception to Finished Product </a>series of blog posts about the work involved in creating Burning Empires. It's a fantastic read. I'd love to see something similar from Rob when he is done.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn, total aside, I wish Thor would blog more. He's exploding with knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've heard My Life With Master, Sorcerer, and other games also benefited from dedicated, slow, and methodical approaches. Does anyone know if any write ups exist outlining their process? What other games were developed this way? I'd love to read more. Certainly not the only way (or better or worse) but it's nice to see.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213545/#Comment_213545" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T20:56:05+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  8:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2009 8:56PM by Robert_Bohl.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, John!<br><br>I don't know if I'll still have the energy when it's over to do the kind of blog post series you're talking about with the level of dedication it'd need to get it done right. However, I can say that the very first version of the game's rules were written on a notepad on my thigh on the drive back from Gen Con 06 to keep me from crashing off the road and dying due to falling asleep at the wheel. The ashcan was Gen Con 08, and there's a sliver of a chance I'll have the final game done for Gen Con 09.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213590/#Comment_213590" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T08:50:38+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  8:50AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been a critic in the past of Rob's, particular of ashcaning, but yeah, in the past few months, I've come to see Rob's model -- both in development and in self-promotion -- to be a good case study.<br><br>It's so freaking hard to resist the call to rush when people are eager about your game, and to have to disappoint constantly with "nope, not done yet -- and not for a while." As I've told folks about Dresden, I don't want the game to go from vaporware in people's minds to "crapware" because it's rushed. The latter is much, much harder to recover from than the former.<br><br>I say all that to say: I applaud Rob's patience and dedication to making "kickassware."                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213654/#Comment_213654" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T18:15:08+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  6:15PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, too, have often looked at Rob's example to remind myself, "Calm down, focus, and take the time to do this <em>right</em>."<br><br>Hurray, Rob!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213660/#Comment_213660" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T19:04:02+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  7:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know this isn't supposed to be a Rob lovefest, but fuckyeah...
