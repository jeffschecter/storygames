Like to hear it, here it go:<br/><br/><b>A story game is a game in which players can directly make things up as part of an imagined story, <i>and</i> things the players make up can in turn influence the interactions with the game rules.</b><br/><br/>Obviously that's really just a reading of Brand's maxim that an RPG is a game where the fiction is part of the rules. I've tried to fold in a little of Vincent's old semi-definition, specifically the bit where players can interact directly with fiction without going through rules. That part seems important.<br/><br/>D&amp;D4 meets this definition. Of course, it is also a roleplaying game, which as a category is a subset of story games. Exactly how to characterize that subset is a much harder question, and maybe not one for this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151866/#Comment_151866" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T10:55:45+00:00" title="June 20, 2008 10:55AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>...it is also a roleplaying game, which as a category is a subset of story games.</blockquote>\nMike nails it right here.  "Story game" is broader than "roleplaying game," not narrower.  Many people make this mistake and think "story games" refers a certain kind of RPG, when it was originally coined in this context (by Clinton) to include all RPGs and some things that might not be RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151869/#Comment_151869" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T11:04:13+00:00" title="June 20, 2008 11:04AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam:<br/>Oh, no, just curious (which is why I said that). I haven't even looked at overviews or spoilers or what-not for 4e; and I was really wondering if they got SG/Indie awesome into it (and what that is).<br/><br/>As a contrasting example, I almost never see Hero 5e and its STACKS of supplements discussed here; but it's so clearly Gam/Sim that I wouldn't expect it here (or at the Forge).<br/><br/>Mike:<br/>That's a workable definition, but I think all its heavy lifting occurs after the conjunction (else "let's pretend" and improv and shit-talking at board games would all count, too). In fact, wouldn't nearly every RPG qualify? I "make up" a character, which probably only engages a subset of the total rules (e.g. one class); and that, in turn, is an influence on my interactions with the rules (i.e. it determines which rules I use 95% of the time).<br/><br/>But I'm not really seeking to discuss definitions, <i>per se</i>. Instead, I am curious as to why 4e holds so much allure for this community, which would explain its being discussed here rather than y'all going to RPG.net where there's currently 155 folks in the D&amp;D sub-forum, to ask for advice or to discuss rule tweaks. Folks with probably a LOT more experience with D&amp;D (even 4e) than most of us who have eschewed that system for years (or decades, in my case).<br/><br/>Really. Honestly.

The rules, from what I've read so far, are centered on providing and overcoming challenges, not providing and creating story. However, it also looks like a very solid base for applying story game rules to. Without tweaking anything, for example, you can run skill challenges in a way that completely focuses on story where success and failure doesn't determine victory or defeat, but instead desirable or undesirable outcomes from the players' perspective based on their goals.  And if there's anything we like talking about for than games designed to be "story games", it's about how to play any games as story games regardless of the core design.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><cite>Posted By: Albert A</cite>Hero 5e isn't the new hotness right now, and D&amp;D4E is.</blockquote>So YOU say... prove it.

Techniques that somebody says are similar to techniques used or created in "dirty hippy games".

Why here (low experience and authority) and not there (grognards and the game's creators)? </blockquote>\nMy own opinion is that the most mild adjustments to the rules here would be taken as very outre on those forums, and so there wouldn't be much useful feedback. There's some interesting stuff being discussed there, but I don't see it as fitting in well with the things people have been discussing here about 4e. I don't think that's actually the reason, just a gut feeling.<br/><br/>I think a more likely reason is that this is a forum where people put in a lot of self-reflection about what they want out of their gaming and what experience a given game gives them. I haven't found many other places on the internet where self-reflection is so evident in people's posts, never mind gaming sites. Or to put it another way, reading the 4e threads here doesn't make me want to beat my head against my desk, and I can't say that about other sites. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152334/#Comment_152334" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T00:16:32+00:00" title="June 23, 2008 12:16AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not too fond of the [4e] threads, myself. I like the game just fine, but it's not really where I hoped this whole "story games" thing would lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the new style of D&amp;D and I think some much-needed simplifications were worked into the system, but I'm one of those clowns who made the mistake of thinking that "Story Game" was about trying to find some variation of play in RPGs (based, perhaps, on the cooperative ideas put forth in games like Baron Munchausen or Pantheon or Prime Time Adventures.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, quite frankly, I don't think that "simplification of characters" or any of the other nifty stuff that this new edition has accomplished does that. I think clarification of motivation might make [4e] more of a story game (the whole alignment thing has never really cut it for me - not enough rewards, too many punishments, too broad, etc.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI think diversification of the possible storylines generated by a game might make it more about story while keeping the idea of a game in there.  For me, [4e] doesn't do that. It's about fighting and magic and wondering what will happen that causes the next fight, but that's just good fun. It's not much of a story at all. I LIKE it, but it's not a story... well, not the kind of story I'm looking for in a game, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, is [4e] a story game? No. Not the kind I was looking for, anyway. Is it a bad game or one I wouldn't play? Are you crazy? Of course I'd play, it's D&amp;D, man!<br/>\nBut I come to this site looking for something else... A way to apply the rules of narrative consequence to a mutually-satisfying game.<br/>\n(I'm not looking for a model of reality. I'm not looking for an exciting system of  GM-empowering encounters. It's cool, but it's not why I'm here.)<br/>\nI want to find the freedom to tell my stories while giving my fellow players an equal chance to tell their own, mixing it all together into something greater.<br/>\nI want to find the rules that make a great story available to support and encourage newcomers.<br/>\nI hope I can still find it in the forrest of [4e] arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real question, I suppose, is: Does [4e] belong on this site? <br/>\nWell, for old time's sake, I can't say I mind it squeezing in. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I'm just gonna post about it on this thread and not worry about the rest of 'em.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152346/#Comment_152346" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T01:42:29+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  1:42AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>Does [4e] belong on this site?</blockquote>How is that in question, when quite obviously a whole bunch of people (including the Admin) think it does belong here and enjoy talking about it here?<br/><br/>People here talk about all kinds of games.
