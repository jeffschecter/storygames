At a point early on in the episode, one of the main villains is receiving important plot information from a ethereal video screen and we, as the audience, are watching this from over his shoulder. A few steps back, but essentially over his shoulder. Several times during the scene the villain turns away from the video screen and tries to process the information while looking directly at us.<br/><br/>And I was all like, "Wait a minute. Are you talking to me, dude?"<br/><br/>It was, of course, a classic Shakespearean aside played up for full dramatic effect and with no hint of self-awareness. And it was beautiful. It got me thinking: do people do this when they roleplay? Simply discussing what your character is thinking or feeling at a certain moment, particularly during a difficult decision, seems fairly common. I believe I've done it, and I know I've witnessed it. And I know that certain games have aside-like mechanics (such as <i>Inspectres</i>' confessional). But I wonder if anyone regularly incorporates formal, dramatic, fourth-wall-safe asides in their own play.<br/><br/>I think I might try this soon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118464/#Comment_118464" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T08:46:01+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  8:46AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Formal, no, but informal for sure.

So much good stuff can come from hearing about the inner dimensions of a character. <br/><br/>In the long running free-form ars magica derived homebrew I played in with my friends, the Ennead, I apparently did a lot of asides like that. My character was the first character I ever played in role playing (this was my very first campaign). I don't remember it exactly, but a friend pointed out that while I often gave asides about what this character, Stellan, was thinking, I absolutely never did it with my second character: Caleth, who happened to be a formerly murderous psychopath who was a natural telepath and a mage. No wonder!<br/><br/>In Doubt, the jeepform game, there are two parallel narrative threads: one is about the day to day lives of a pair of actors who are dealing with some difficult relationship issues, the other is the play that they are acting in together. In the daily events thread, there are no asides, the directions are to play the scenes with realism and naturalism in mind. In the play scenes, however,  the players are directed to play it up for all the dramatic effect you can handle. Project, exagerate emotions, and give asides to the audience from the point of view of the character. Another fun thing is that a different set of players play the day to day actors vs. the actors in the play, so you get two different people being able to give a view of the same characters. Just one set of them is characters acting in character. Lots of beautiful play in there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118477/#Comment_118477" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T09:15:53+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  9:15AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my recollection, an "Shakespearian" aside is common as rain in gaming: every time someone makes an OOC joke. Many of Will's asides were mere jests, intended to keep the groundlings interested during otherwise "cerebral" or conversational scenes, and had nothing to do with conveying new, internal information. Quite to the contrary: they often relied on the audience having already had some hidden character aspect revealed, to make the puns and double-entendres even possible/comprehensible!<br/><br/>On the other hand, I find formal asides to be pretty rare indeed. You might see OOC discussion, debate, and protestations ("Naw, man, your/my guy would NEVER do something like that; it makes no sense!"). But I, for one, can't think of a single time someone, in character, actually presented an aside as defined in the OP: explicitly speaking to the "fourth wall." Put another way: who's the fourth wall, in gaming? A spouse watching on occasionally, while knitting? Folks standing around a con game table?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being my usual pedantic self; but I'd say that if you answer, "the players, OOC, are the fourth wall," then you are not speaking of an aside anymore... or, rather, so much interaction qualifies as an "aside" that it loses formal utility as a term.<br/><br/>[As an quick aside (heh), soliloquies are a-whole-nother breed of fish, and they happen routinely. IIRC, there's even a formal stage in a round of combat, in HERO System, expressly for such four-color exclamations and exhortations. And it's common as rain for situation or fact exposition via NPC monologue, by GMs.]<br/><br/>Anyhow, I think use of formal asides in gaming could be an interesting technique for a game whose frisson hinges on players having OOC knowledge while playing IC. Note the term "hinges on!" If they do not provide a critical element to the tension of play, they are almost always going to seem forced, like a mustache-twisting villain in a melodrama. IMHO, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118483/#Comment_118483" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T09:31:58+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  9:31AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Anyhow, I think use of formal asides in gaming could be an interesting technique for a game whose frisson hinges on players having OOC knowledge while playing IC.

The asides I made as Stellan were mostly small potato stuff, that I shared for humor or for simple reflection. They were well received. There are dimensions of our characters that would be fun to explore, but we just don't think to, mostly, in rpg, probably because of realism tropes (ie people who tell you what they are thinking IRL are usually *crazy*). But why be limited by the real world? <br/><br/>Cell phone conversations would be a good "in character" in to use. Oh and in my play group's latest game of Primetime Adventures, we used a finger-wiggle miming typing on a keyboard to indicate that things we were saying were interpretations of the action as written on the fanfic boards.  We even had some emails we sent around that were in that voice. Folks made up fictitious posters like "MollyRules", "BenisDead" etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118485/#Comment_118485" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T09:34:38+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  9:34AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll have you know there is nothing forced about mustache-twisting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118487/#Comment_118487" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T09:41:08+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  9:41AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2008 9:40AM by David Artman.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Cell phone conversations would be a good "in character" in to use.</blockquote>OK, THAT is a killer technique.

Maybe we should set aside (heh) the notion of "Shakespearian" until someone defines that more accurately than I have above. But I am fairly sure that if you actually look at Shakespeare's lines that begin [Aside], you'll see that they're rarely revelatory, far more often humorous than pensive, and quite squarely aimed at the audience (who often has gotten the "inside" info that sets up the joke through normal scenes and dialog). There's some revelations sprinkled in, sure; but even those are as likely to be banal historical facts or character introductions mid-dialog than "insights" or "Processing information" in the sense that we are seeing "into the mind of the character."<br/><br/>Now, it might be too narrow a use of "formal" aside, but it's THIS sort of thing that I think the OP was driving at (from Macbeth):\n<blockquote><cite>MACBETH, ACT I, SCENE III</cite>MACBETH<br/>    [Aside]<br/>    Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,<br/>    Why hath it given me earnest of success,<br/>    Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:<br/>    If good, why do I yield to that suggestion<br/>    Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair<br/>    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,<br/>    Against the use of nature?

THAT's the formal, "fourth wall" aside; that's some serious introspection and revelation--in fact, without it and one other like it later, we'd never get a glimpse at the nerve-wracking, anguishing temptation (or fate?) facing our tragic hero; he'd become a mere power-grabbing villain.<br/><br/>And that's what first grabbed me about the whole notion of this thread: what would make that particular technique work, in play, to magnify theme or drive story or get at teh awesomez? Put another way, now that we have a strong identification of a formal aside, what bolts onto that to make it resonate and not be some strained, hand-washing, mustache-twisting cliche?

In between sessions we would talk for hours about the characters, world and the game, and those conversations <i>mattered</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118528/#Comment_118528" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T11:19:56+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 11:19AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>mustache-twisting cliche</blockquote>\nAgain with the moustache-twisting.

In fact, I think I have them quite often. I'll be stymied by a particular situation and take the briefest of moments to proclaim to my fellow gamers the dilemma going on inside my character's head as a way of sorting out my thoughts. In the future, I'm going to try to handle them in character, with a cue much like the typing fingers or phone call, but more abstract. Perhaps an actual spotlight, if there is room in the budget.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118553/#Comment_118553" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T12:11:40+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 12:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could go with chin-stroking, for introspection. Or a common LARP technique (usually used to designate OOC): "frame" your face with your hands open, like parentheses, then shift that frame and your head (a bit) so that your face isn't bracketed. Or, heck, just turn away from the group and speak a bit more loudly (so they can hear), which should be a clear signal that you're words are "off the table" or "non-visible."<br/><br/>All cool techniques. Any ideas for system bits (or synergies) that would really shine, that would make such asides key to play, rather than a "generic" technique to which one might resort in any game system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118554/#Comment_118554" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T12:12:09+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 12:12PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Epi, that's a scary picture.  are you wearing pants?  i don't really wanna know.<br/>\num..."With Great Power" has the cool Thought Balloon thingee.<br/>\nit's one of my favorite things about the game.  <br/>\ni think it comes kinda close to what you're talking about, at least as a mechanic/prop to help facilitate that kind of thing.<br/>\nit'd be neat if the Thought Balloon gave a mechanical advantage, and had to be passed around...maybe the gloating villian would have a prop to help them monologue more convincingly?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118561/#Comment_118561" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T12:23:02+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 12:23PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen "Asides" done in LARP - where a player could make a "time out" gesture, and then make comments directly to the organisers, speaking <i>as their character thought.</i><br/><br/>Half the time?
