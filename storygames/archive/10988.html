For most games, the dice roll goes in the middle. Stuff that sets up the dice roll goes on the right, with arrows into the roll; for example, things that modify the dice, positioning, and so on. Results of the roll go on the left; like damage, fallout, etc. If the game includes some kind of feedback loop, arrows go from the results back to the influencers. <br/><br/>This does a bit better job, IMHO, of illustrating what happens at the table, than you get from simply reading the rules. I really cannot run a game or even play very well without these notes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243856/#Comment_243856" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T09:07:50+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  9:07AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read the book through once, constantly running a critical department in my head. Ideally I understand each paragraph of text not only as a passive student, but as a critic and designer. Therefore I understand not only <i>how</i> to do something, but also <i>why</i>. This helps immensely in putting together a complete picture of how the game's procedures should go, and consequently I don't usually have any significant problem in running the new game after one read-through. I still need to have the book there as reference for anything more complex than, say, <i>Nine Worlds</i>, but that's just because I don't memorize the text when I read it, I only analyze it.<br/><br/>A negative facet to this active reading (as we might call the technique) is that sometimes I project too much and end up inventing my own procedures that do not in fact reflect the game text so much as my internal sense for how the game "has to" work. The effect is usually not very pronounced, but it does mean that I sometimes have great reluctance to play a game exactly according to its own rules after I've figured out how the rules "should" go. Probably the worst experience is when I read game texts from schools of thought that I don't appreciate or understand - Nordic immersionism springs to mind. It's like I have to turn my brains off and skip as much of the text as I can to get to the end. I guess that happens to you whatever way you read, though, as long as you allow yourself to evaluate whether the game sounds fun at all.<br/><br/>I can usually play a game reasonably well if I've read the text in the above manner within a month or so before the session. More than that, it starts to fade. The same goes for when I read many games in succession (such as when going through the Gencon haul). It also depends on how interesting I found the game, of course. To give you an idea of how this goes, I'm pretty confident that I could play <i>Time &amp; Temp</i> (read 3 weeks ago) or <i>Dance &amp; the Dawn</i> (2 months) right away, while <i>Annalise</i> (2 months) I'd have to read through carefully a second time, because it didn't excite me that much on the first read-through.<br/><br/>This is not to say that I can't have trouble with game texts, there certainly are some games that are written in such convoluted ways that I have to reread them several times or even ask for help from the author. Tony LB's games spring to mind, as does the first edition of <i>Nine Worlds</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243861/#Comment_243861" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T10:37:26+00:00" title="November 26, 2009 10:37AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read through the book more or less, skipping around and only actually reading the parts that interest me. <br/><br/>I then go back and re-read enough so that I have an idea of how to play, then I play it (although sometimes I'll also say, make a character to see how that goes)<br/><br/>I find this to be an easy way to learn a game, but it has lead to more than one instance of "doing it wrong"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243863/#Comment_243863" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T11:01:41+00:00" title="November 26, 2009 11:01AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read the rules cover-to-cover, straight through (if the book says to use a different reading order, I follow that; if the book says to stop and do something else, I ignore it).  Then I read the rules again, maybe cover-to-cover, maybe selectively.  Repeat as needed. (This reading pattern comes from how I read computer books.)  Then, if appropriate and they don't exist, I create cheat sheets for the game, particularly character creation cheat sheets.  This both helps people I play with and makes me think about the game.

I find examples useful here (if they're well done, naturally).  Then I'll do a "test run" of the rules, where I sit down and make up a situation for various rules situations (a combat scene, a bartering scene, etc.), roll some dice, and satisfy myself that I know how it works.<br/><br/>Then I write up a cheat sheet, something I pass around to everyone else that lets them know the basic rules and any finicky stuff (combat actions, how healing is handled, how a particular innate magical ability works, etc.); while this is for other people to use, it also cements my understanding of the game (because I learn best by teaching other people).<br/><br/>So all in all, it's kind of a labor-intensive process if I want to do it right.  I can cut corners here and there (usually giving the players a caveat of "I'm still learning this game, so this is an experiment"), but the cheat sheet is practically essential to me at this point.

I veto any players attempts to create a character which might use magic/space travel/cyberware, making up some shoddy excuse about keeping the game simple for the first few sessions. Then when my players try to do something that I'm not equipped to deal with I either make up the rules and hope they won't notice or try to find the relevant rules in the book while they talk to each other about non gaming related stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243907/#Comment_243907" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T18:22:06+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  6:22PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2009 6:23PM by Sebastian.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read the rules from cover to cover, then re-read the complex parts (normally the section on conflicts).

I did this with PTA, to see where fan mail comes from and where it goes.<br/><br/>During the first session, there's some leafing through the rules, because there are always points that seem obvious during reading, but suddenly raise questions during play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243927/#Comment_243927" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-27T02:26:42+00:00" title="November 27, 2009  2:26AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read it once.

If I end up struggling through more of the reference stuff like lists of things, I skip them or cherry pick interesting items.<br><br>After reading it, if it's long I usually take a break from it entirely as I've had enough of that world or setting for a while. Then if I get excited about actually playing it with people, I'll reread pretty much the whole thing again. I'll need to do this because I'm reading it for functionality now. That's fun, but it's a different part of the brain for me.<br>The first time I read a longer game my problem-solving mind simply skims over mechanics. I'm looking for more of a "feel" of the game. The second time I read it, I'm actually trying to figure out how to play.<br><br>If it's a short text, I try to run it as soon as I can after reading it the first time since shorter games have less color and setting, while being mostly mechanics and rules. If I don't play them quick, the info will ooze out of my head fast!<br/><br/>All this is assuming I find the games awesome. If I dislike it for any reason, I'll stop then and there.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
