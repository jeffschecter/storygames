This skin is about being lost in a different but "real" world and struggling between online-chat, facebook-stalking and real live. <br/>It's about being the best hacker around, cybersex and the delusion of power you can have on the net. <br/>It should also be about stalking people until you have enough leverage over them to make them do real world stuff for you since you are not confortable enough without your laptop. <br/><br/>A few things i was thinking about:<br/><br/>Backstory:<br/>You are stalking someone on *Facebook* for quite a while, gain a string on them<br/>Someone you look up to has denied your Friend-request multiple times, they gain 2 strings on you<br/><br/>Darkest Self should be about locking yourself in with your cyberstuff and venge digital revenge on everyone. It should require someone to come to you and get you out to the sunlight again. <br/><br/>Sexmove:<br/>If it is online remove a condition and get -1 forward<br/>If it is real they get a string on you but you get +2 forward <br/><br/>(the idea here is to make online sex a thing that you do but it doesn't really make you feel good. Real sex is awkward but hey you did it) <br/><br/>Move ideas: <br/><br/>Everyone leaves a cybertrace/hack their cellphone<br/>When you search for information about someone roll+cool/dark (?) 10+ choose 3, 7-9 choose 1 <br/>And some kind of "read the sitch" move where you can find out stuff about them from the internet. Potentially everyone could do that i guess but you are better than they. This should give you information/strings etc.<br/><br/>Erotic-Chatting<br/>basically a move to allow you to easy trigger your cybersex move with something interesting on a 7-9 <br/><br/>Hack their *Facebook*<br/>Allows you to put conditions on them<br/><br/>Maybe a Move about being good at science/math<br/>Allows you to get strings on teachers but may put "bullied by the jocks" condition on you or something. <br/><br/>This is what i have for now. Can anyone help me with this? Any ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386077/#Comment_386077" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T14:35:05+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  2:35PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mobile, so I can't really read or comment in detail, but shouldn't it be monstrous?

Personally I got a different vibe coming from it for how it's supernatural though; have you ever seen the TV show Heroes? If so, do you remember that kid, Micah Sanders, who could use technology just by touching it? That would be my take on it.<br/>"When you interface with electronics directly, roll +Dark" or something. I say Dark since I imagine that most of the time you don't need the power unless you're trying to do something you're not supposed to, but I'm not sure which stat for sure. We don't exactly have Weird in Monsterhearts. Just tossing ideas around I guess.<br/><br/>But yeah, this would be an awesome skin that I would totally love to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386093/#Comment_386093" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T17:37:34+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  5:37PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spider.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386130/#Comment_386130" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T06:17:02+00:00" title="August  1, 2012  6:17AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any ideas on how to get it over mechanicly that this is a person longing for "real" contact/friendships/intimicy but not being able to get it easy?
