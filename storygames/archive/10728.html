You need to pay attention to what people are trying to get out of the game, and there are a lot of potentially mismatching agendas. (I'm sitting at the table to explore my character; I'm sitting at the table to outwit the fictional elements of the puzzle; and so on.)<br/><br/>There are lots of agendas, and there are also lots of differences in the techniques of how to go about pursuing your agendas. (I pursue this by you presenting obstacles; I pursue this by rough consensus with you.) When you take this combination of agendas and techniques: you have a lot of possible differences. Between play groups and between players, you can say that people are playing almost different games. Proper blend of agendas and techniques is necessary.<br/><br/>I believe all of this, and it affects how I look at games. But: why are RPGs this way? For a creative activity like Rock Band, or for a board game like Ticket to Ride, I don't worry about agendas and techniques. Instead, I just play. But with games, I think a lot more about the interplay of individual preferences with the game as written, and what it takes to ensure a proper blend. Does it have to be this complex?<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>So having said that: RPGs players have evolved compatible cultures of play, and even when they are outside of those cultures they can adapt to play "good enough" to blend with the group; so you can flatten some preferences. And there are techniques/agendas going on in Rock Band or board games, and those are figured out by whom I invite to play. (If you don't like music or want to play hyper-technical: you wouldn't want to play Rock Band with us. If competitive board games stress you out: you wouldn't want to play a board game with us.) But I still feel like it's easier to pick out those differences in other games, while among RPG players it seems there's an explosion of possible differences.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238059/#Comment_238059" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T13:59:17+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  1:59PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With board games and computer games, the agenda is (often? always?) built in to the game.

So if the game doesn\u2019t line up with your tastes, no great loss.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe video game preferences can be as finicky and specific as RPGs. Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and many Wii games feel more like many boardgames, in all the ways described above. But these games are a small percentage of video games (although they represent a larger percentage of game purchases).<br/>\n<br/>\nRPGs in addition to requiring a lot from you, can themselves be a manifestation of one\u2019s finicky preferences. Many people use RPGs as wish fulfillment to indulge in exploring their other preferences (TV shows, movies, books, music) or fantasies (I\u2019m playing a cooler version of me that\u2019s going to stick it to the man). They\u2019re coming into RPGs with a lot of expectations. So they will be very picky about which RPGs they want to play as to best increase their odds of playing out their wish fulfillment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238071/#Comment_238071" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T17:58:13+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  5:58PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2009 6:01PM by Brand_Robins.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like everyone's answers. <br><br>I also think that there is often an aesthetic element of RPGs that goes well with some level of finicky. Food, music, books, movies... all of these things have folks who are finicky, elitist, specific, or dedicated about. You'll find lots of folks who just will not read Salman Rushdie, or who don't like tacos, or think that country western is made by beating a cat with a fiddle. All of these people are obviously broken as human beings, but we don't really find it surprising when someone says that they don't like speed metal or rap or goat cheese. <br><br>When I play Ticket to Ride, I'm rarely concerned with the aesthetics of the game. When I play an RPG, otoh, there is a real creative and aesthetic element to it. The mode and means and output of play matters, because that aesthetic and creative endeavor is part of why I'm playing -- much like why I'm listening to music or eating a really nice meal. So, when folks can identify what they like and don't like in RPGs I find it less surprising. <br/><br/>Hell, if anything I find it nice when people can accurately talk about what they do and do not want in games.

Maybe Rock Band (at least the quickplay mode) is a toy and not a game.<br/><br/>Similarly if you play Ticket to Ride and one player decides he's going to always built routes from Frankfurt to every nearby city, because he's not very good at the game, he's going to mess up the game.  This could be explained as an agenda issue, or you could call this not playing the game.<br/><br/>Maybe it's actually that board games do have built in agenda, but some people ignore it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238123/#Comment_238123" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T06:49:40+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  6:49AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>For a creative activity like Rock Band, or for a board game like Ticket to Ride, I don't worry about agendas and techniques. w</blockquote>\nAs someone who is a bigger board gamer than role-player, I have to say hardcore board gamers sometimes do pay attention to a board game's creative agenda, or specific design techniques. I'm always look at board games and analyzing how the game's design subtly guides and influences game play. <br/><br/>I also pay a lot of attention to what people want out of a board game before pulling one off the shelf; even if everyone wants to play a "bidding game", if I'm looking for a cutthroat tactical auction game, but I know my wife would rather play a game that focuses on the economics of the resources, We need to be careful about the game we pick.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I know plenty of role players who couldn't case less about the "creative agenda" of a RPG.

This requires a certain amount of social self-awareness.</li>\n<li>Try to develop a flexible language of RPG preferences which is both accessible and detailed enough to let you correct for misunderstandings. Some versions of GNS are detailed enough, but you need to be careful because of the different interpretations at that level. Other attempts include some of the Nordic larp theory (such as process theory), Mo's sockets, and my views. All of these rely on a technical self-awareness, the willingness and ability to introspect on the misunderstanding in light of the particular theory language. Obviously this also requires some general understanding of the terms, although at this level of detail the terms are often much easier to understand for the layperson, since there is less abstraction and more ready examples.</li>\n<li>Use a game-specific language to try to resolve the misunderstanding. This can be the most concrete approach, if everyone is familiar with the game and its structures. On the other hand, if the game is intended to resolve preference problems in this way, this should be a carefully considered design goal - after all many of the preferences of a player may not be expressible in the terms of the game, it may even lead to confusion. Wanting to be challenged in combat, doesn't necessarilly mean engaging the "challenge mechanic" more often.</li>\n<li>Play a game designed to resolve player preference conflicts, either overtly or subtly. It is possible to design a RPG with this as a specific design goal, and encourage a wide variety of play preferences towards collaboration during the course of play. In a game like this, the designer takes part of the responsibility for a cohesive play preference during play.</li>\n<li>In practice, of course, you may see a mixture of any of these methods. </li>\n</ul>\nIn any case, preferences will evolve and correct during the course of play, it is neither fixed nor predetermined.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238146/#Comment_238146" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T09:00:17+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  9:00AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think people are finnicky about RPGs because they are going to be creating part of it when they play.
