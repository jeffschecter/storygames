                            When I was younger, so much younger than today, we did a lot of "working for the king" type of play. It was an easy road to adventure, with a big boss guy who sent you out on missions and quests. We didn't get a lot of moral authority until Pendragon -- but we had military authority in plenty. Good old imperialistic use of force solved all the problems, in the end. <br/><br/>As I got "better" at the illusionism I moved away from that structure, however, as it gave to obvious a map for the use of force. I found ways of pushing players and characters around through more diffuse networks, and so moved into the rootless drifter and random adventurer group for a bit, then got into the mercinary and outside-the-code hero motif for the longest time. <br/><br/>These days, however, I do focus a lot on moral authority (why your character is good enough to be acting as he does -- more Raymond Chandler than Mallory, though) and very little on working for the king. Which means that a lot of play ends up revolving around discovery and proof of the PC's moral and ethical character, as it is something that needs to be shown rather than just assumed.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the social authority angle is often absent as well. Much as I still like cop and knight games in theory, these days most of my games have characters who are in a dubious position vis a vie the establishment. I suppose that's the dying dregs of my punk adolescence and anti-authoritarian 20s dying out slowly. Games like Dogs seem to have us moving back towards social authority characters, and we're looking more at the "now that you have power and authority, what do you do with it" type games than the endless coming of age stories of earlier years.<br/><br/>Of course, Dogs is interesting in that you have both social and moral authority and an essentially endless quest -- but neither in the typical mode for RPGs -- and (in general) no "king" or boss that you're working for. Dogs work for the church, sure, and are doing what they're doing for God -- but most of the time neither of those things is all that important in the structure of the game.                        </div>

                            I've run Dogs-like games before I knew there was a Dogs. <br/>
<br/>
My 1986 AD&amp;D campaign had PC clerics and paladins (and other attached folk) traveling from town to town, investigating crimes and judging the guilty. Sometimes they executed people.<br/>
<br/>
My last D&amp;D 3E campaign had PC princes and princesses proving themselves to their father by traveling to border outposts to set things right. They had moral authority to decide what was right though they were beholden to their king.<br/>
<br/>
I've used religions in my campaigns to insert moral authority. The two examples above are the most striking, but not the only ones.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, however, when we played Star Wars, we played what I called a "Fuck the Rebellion" campaign where the PCs were gray at best and didn't give a damn about helping the Rebels or Empire. It was a smuggler game, because everyone wants to be Han Solo.                        </div>

                            My traditional gaming has tried to have the best of both worlds, by casting the players in the role of lawful mercenaries. Yes, they're killing people for money, but they're bound by code and contract.<br/>
<br/>
It isn't really moral authority, however; in the end you make sure not to break contract out of good business sense!<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to put together a modern mercenary game, which uses the escalation rhythym in Dogs - "What do you do now?" "How about now?"                        </div>

                            This issue came up in an L5R game I ran, because the situation involved villagers, and some were criminals. The samurai have lots of social authority, and acted as judges and executioners in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I find games that really dig into these social and moral authority themes to be really interesting. I am playing with this now in Burning Wheel, where one of the characters is a landholding knight, and the rest are mostly free tenants or retainers in the knight's household. The conflicts come from being caught in the middle, between the (sometimes unlawful) demands of the locals and the demands of the distant lords to whom the knight owes taxes.                        </div>

<em>PCs are often rootless wanderers who are outside of the social system</em><br/><br/>Did they kill evil orcs to save the good villagers?  Or, put it another way -- did they ever join with the evil orcs to slaughter and loot the villagers?  Rootless wanderers, in my experience, often have a great deal of moral authority -- I mean, the pseudo-default rootless wanderer is Kane from Kung Fu, who wandered the world making things right.  Or, you know, the A-Team.  In such scenarios, the primary character being outside the social structure lets them be the impartial moral force of the story.<br/><br/><em>We didn't get a lot of moral authority until Pendragon -- but we had military authority in plenty.</em><br/><br/>One of my diffuse and poorly-communicated points in the original thread was that, in your typical Fantasy setting, moral and martial authority go hand in hand.  It sounds to me like your early campaigns had that moral authority aspect by the weight of this association, whether or not you really <em>explored</em> that moral authority.<br/><br/>I suspect -- and this may be just my biases -- that the vast majority of gaming places the PCs in positions of moral authority.  Not as bishops and theologians, mind, but the people who come into a situation and right the wrongs that no one else is dealing with.  That's how stories work.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Actually a lot of my early gaming was pretty fast and lose with the morals. Killing the villagers was not unknown, nor was making pacts with orcs and demons out of the question. The best moral authority you could expect was that might makes right. Which seems to be part of your point, but in a rather uncomfortable way -- it certainly doesn't say a lot of good about us as players. <br/><br/>It was really in the illusionism phase that we got into might for right, and the Arthurian ideal of the crusading knight. Before that we were all in our early adolescent angst phase and got pretty bloody and had a tendancy for extreme revenge fantasy.<br/><br/>Not, mind you, that we never saved the school kids on Rural Route 5. Sometimes we did. Other times we hooked up with the terrorists and killed the cops. I suppose some of the middle period games had the moral authority that someone like Conan has: that joint work of "barbarism triumphs" combined with "even though the character takes no good action for any good reason, the conclusion has positive results in the world anyway." But as the players weren't authoring the characters to have that happen it only resulted in moral authority because I, as GM, forced their actions to be for the best in the end anyway. <br/><br/>However, I also suspect that I'm probably a bit unusual in this. Most gaming that my friends tell me about has a definite moral and heroic bias -- the good people doing the good thing, or at least the bad people doing the good thing despite themselves.<br/><br/>Edit: P.S. Kane from Kung Fu is interesting as he's outside the cultural order as well as the social order. But even before him we had the masterless man -- the cowboy and the ronin -- who loom so large in our conception of the hero. Certainly outside the social order, but with such massive moral authority that the term "white hat" means "good guy."                        </div>

                            In one of the D&amp;D sessions I played with my kids, they found some orcs who had taken over a dwarf's mine by force and were digging for gems. They enslaved the orcs and kept the mine to enrich themselves.<br/>

                            Hmmm, moral or social authority...<br/>
<br/>
Concentrating on campaigns that went more than a couple sessions, in the earliest games, the PC's were basically like forty-niners in the California gold rush, except with somewhat higher mortality rates. When the dungeon ran out off stuff to loot and the GM didn't bother to make a new one, the PC's went through a sort of "bust" where they scraped by in town and got into trouble fighting other ruffians. Eventually they were hired as caravan guards and fought off a tribe of injuns--er, goblins. No moral authority there, just "Ya gotta do what ya gotta do."<br/>
<br/>
And in fact that was the tone of much later gaming, although I suppose there were social connections and inner morals which constrained and to some extent motivated character actions. It's interesting to note, though, that a couple characters in one of my favorite campaigns had "personal missions" that might have been embryonic quests--but neither of these really had an opportunity to focus play, and in fact if they had, I think the game would have been worse since they'd have become prima donnas within party-based play.<br/>
<br/>
Other games had more overt missions in which the characters did assume authority: they actively allied with and to some extent led one side or the other in some kind of political/military conflict. The issues were more cultural than moral, though--generally a resistance or liberation struggle of some kind. In the chaotic situation, though, excercising authority meant killing for a cause, with your own two hands. Sometimes one had an opportunity to also lead a small group of followers as well. In short we were basically a "guerilla cell", sometimes with aspirations of becoming an army. Now what might have made that more interesting for the hardcore Nar types would be if we'd had to not only pick at the enemy troops and fortifications, but also fight for hearts and minds and punish collaborators--but we never made things that tough on ourselves.                        </div>

The other question is, do the PCs look to someone else for moral guidance?  Is so, then they are acting for another moral authority.  <br/><br/>I find that either of these are rare.  PCs rarely take to heart lessons from an NPC, and conversely NPCs rarely take to heart lessons from the PCs.

                            John, <br/><br/>I actually think that the PCs won't change for NPCs and NPCs won't change for PCs is probably just what you say it is in the post. Its related to railroading and non-character co-ownership, gone to the lesser point of character non-investment between players. If a PC never changes for the NPCs, and vice versa, it feels heavily like the old my guyism -- a refusal to give over or admit that you're in a joint creation with other people. <br/><br/>As for the two different moral authorities, one is just more literal than the other. The moral authority Josh is talking about comes right out of detective fiction and Chandler's line about "the best possible man in the worst possible world." <br/><br/>Josh, <br/><br/>I don't think you're the weird one. I know much of my current group even post-Vampire and post-Nar play still has issues when I play characters who deliberatly reject moral authority. They can handle evil characters, those who go negative morality, but not those who are more picaresque and just don't care one way or the other. I think part of their brains is just as you say: designed to see story (that damn word again) as the result of people making wrong things right.                        </div>

                            (Cross-posted with Brand, in reply to John)<br/><br/>Yeah, I can't generalize, but in the RQ campaign I played, <i>some</i> of the PCs really did have social authority--and responsibility--since they belonged to the family that owned the manor around which the campaign centered. I'd guess that experience was formative for my concept of PCs who are "static responsibles" who deal with situations that come to them.                        </div>

                            I recently ran an Exalted campaign that fell apart over some of these issues. One of my goals was to examine the moral space that the characters were creating around themselves. I was fairly explicit that the world was in a state of moral decay and that there was no moral authority that the characters could turn to for guidance. Their patron essentially told them that they held the responsibility and that he couldn't be bothered with such things.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to put the characters in positions where they could take moral stands and where they could make examples of themselves. <br/>
<br/>
The players weren't willing to accept themselves as potential moral authorities, though. They kept looking for external guidance.                        </div>

                            That interesting, szilard.  Do they look for external authorities in other games, or was it just the relatively alien setting of Exalted that made them look for a touchstone to base their actions off of?                        </div>

<br/>
To be honest, I am not completely sure. That was the only game that I ran for that group. Thinking about it, in other games that I have played with them, there has generally been a moral authority provided. In those cases where there wasn't, the characters were either relatively amoral / mercenary / acting from necessity or (in one case) I sort of slipped into that role.<br/>

You can call me Stuart, by the way.                        </div>
