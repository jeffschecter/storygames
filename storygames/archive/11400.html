But if you'd rather just know what the dice-resolution mechanic is, here goes:\n<blockquote><b>GOAL</b><br/>1-2\tThe goal fails and the opportunity is lost (until circumstances change).<br/>3-4\tThe goal is partially achieved and the opportunity remains.<br/>5-6\tThe goal is achieved.<br/><br/><b>DANGER</b><br/>1-2\tThe danger comes true.<br/>3-4\tThe danger partially comes true and the danger remains.<br/>5-6\tThe danger does not come true.<br/><br/>When a danger remains, the player or the GM can add that danger to a future roll instead of the danger the would have normally been rolled for.</blockquote>\nBasically you set a goal, define a danger if that goal isn't achieved and then roll 2d6 to be assigned as you see fit.  There's nothing much more simple than that unless you want to start flipping coins.<br/><br/>Anyway, the upshot of this is, as I mentioned, <i>no character sheets</i>.  Mechanically characters are all exactly the same.  We have no stats, no skill sets, no number crunching.  The game instead hinges on whether the things those characters attempt to do succeed or fail, not how the achievement is reached (or not).<br/><br/>For me, this kind of thing is a blessing, because sometimes I just want to tell a story with roleplay and not get all wrapped up in a specific game's mechanics.  Stuff happens with <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow">GHOST/ECHO</a>'s mechanic, and isn't the happening of stuff kind of the whole point of roleplaying?<br/><br/>So I suggested using <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow">GHOST/ECHO</a>'s dice to a couple of friends.  Not to play <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow">GHOST/ECHO</a> (I'm plugging the hell out of it here), but to tell other stories.  One friend said he was interested in those stories, but less interested overall because he didn't want all characters to be mechanically the same.<br/><br/>I can understand this to a certain degree.  Stats and other fiddly bits are how we've traditionally come to own characters, so if you take that away... well, you have just those 2d6 rolling.  As I say, I see it as freeing, but others could see it as losing something.  Where do you fall on the question?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253942/#Comment_253942" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T12:35:28+00:00" title="January 30, 2010 12:35PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my favourite games ever, <i>Mountain Witch</i>, has essentially mechanically identical characters.

I'd say that the question is not answerable because the concept of character itself is much more higher-order than the concept of mechanics. Thus player characters can be mechanized in so many different ways that the purpose for that mechanization can be legion, as well. Similarly games that don't feature mechanical differences can be that way for a wide variety of reasons, the simplest of which is perhaps that there needs be no mechanical complexity where it serves no purpose - so a game that doesn't need mechanical character differentiation consequently shouldn't have it.<br/><br/>Oh, I also realized now that my own <i>Zombie Cinema</i> has mechanically identical characters, even more so than TMW. I can easily say why this is so for my game, exactly: I wanted to remove the matter of character identity completely to the realm of organic evaluation by the players, and I wanted that evaluation of identity to be reflected powerfully on the matters of the fiction. For this reason concrete in-fiction conflicts are often resolved by what amounts to a sort of semi-random voting procedure instead of predetermined character identity mechanized on a character sheet. Characters get things done in the fiction due to the players considering it appropriate that they should, instead of because of mechanical hooks preplanted into the character's identity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253956/#Comment_253956" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T14:09:05+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  2:09PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played and designed several games that feature mechanically undifferentiated characters.<br/><br/>I remember it seeming kind of frightening at first, but in the process I didn't find that anything was lacking from the game. The common feature of those games, however, was some kind of rule structure that allowed the players to fill in fictional outcomes or weigh processes before the rules came into play.<br/><br/>In that way, the fictional differences between characters shine forward, and do not need to be differentiated mechanically.<br/><br/>For instance, in Ghost/Echo/Otherkind dice, the Goal and Dangers are established by the players, and are informed by the fiction and the identity of the characters. For instance, if a character who was a powerful war machine was fighting an enormous guard dog, there would be no problem with a Goal like "pulverize the guard dog", and the dangers people would come up with might be things like "a bite from the dog punctures your air supply cable". or maybe even, "in the process, your power armour is scratched by the dog's struggles".<br/><br/>However, if the character had been described a shy eight-year old girl, the Goal "pulverize the guard dog" would never be named. And the Dangers would be far greater. The rules give so much space for the fiction to colour the outcomes that specifics differentiating characters are not necessary. In a game like D&amp;D, where the guard dog might be defined as dishing out 1d6 damage or whatever, and combat and survival were important, that differentiation might be absolutely vital. <br/><br/>The ongoing flow of the fiction heavily informs how these things progress, as well, which means that characters continue to become more differentiated as events progress. If that little girl had suffered a Danger like "tied up", "broken leg", or worse in the previous scene, that would also affect what kind of Goal and Dangers would be appropriate to narrate for her.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253959/#Comment_253959" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T14:48:54+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  2:48PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In early playtests minion characters in My Life with Master had only a point or two difference in Self-loathing or Weariness from each other; so they were qualitatively undistinguished from each other except by name and the player's vague character conceptualization. And what happened in playtesting was that players all pretty much gravitated to playing craven "dog faced boy" low-esteem Igor characters. So I was motivated to find a way to make the characters more meaningfully distinct. Except I was happy with the stats and resolution equations, so I didn't want to add any more stats to differentiate the characters mechanically. The solution came when Scott Knipe suggested I look at how John Tynes differentiated puppet types in Puppetland. It was a great suggestion. The game's mechanics for "what a puppet can do" and "what a puppet can't do" directly inspired the More Than Human and Less Than Human traits in My Life with Master.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253964/#Comment_253964" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T15:39:34+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  3:39PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want this to turn into one of those "each person talks about their own games" thread, but I think Geiger Counter, Ghost/Echo, and Zombie Cinema are similar in that the characters BEGIN mechanically non-differentiated but they rapidly BECOME differentiated, mostly by taking damage or conditions.  Over the course of play, different characters suffer from different limitations based on the fictional and mechanical things that have occurred during play.  This allows you to start with a clean, even slate but gradually build up mechanical structures that limit and guide decisions as you build up fictional context around the characters and plot.  Mountain Witch is even somewhat similar with Wounds, but I would argue that starting Trust levels mechanically differentiate characters from the get go and that's fully intentional.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253967/#Comment_253967" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T16:04:47+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  4:04PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2010 4:08PM by ccreitz.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>The solution came when Scott Knipe suggested I look at how John Tynes differentiated puppet types in Puppetland.</blockquote> Which rates as one of the best pieces of advice ever given, and beautifully applied.

In fact, I want to set things up so the characters can't achieve their shared goal at all without getting everyone together, and obtaining everyone's cooperation. (In fact in fact, the goal is absurd and worthless and probably impossible, but that's kind of beside the point here.) The best way I could think to make it happen - and maybe I'm just lazy and doing what nearly every game since fighter/cleric/wizard/thief sprung into existence has done - was to narrow the competencies of each PC mechanically, and point out, in the scenario, the whole range of skills. "You need to do X, Y, and Z today, and each of you has two skills from that list. Better stick together!"<br/><br/>So my first answer to Sam's question is "mechanically dissimilar characters (MDCs) underwrite keeping the party together." Games like D&amp;D (and <i>Vampire</i>, and <i>Lacuna</i>...) may really be benefiting from differentiating characters out in the metagame.<br/><br/>But obviously there's more to it. My secret shame: I've never read <i>The Mountain Witch</i>. I'll get to it soon, promise. However, I understand that it directly encodes trust into the mechanics, such that even if the characters were identical in competency, the rules may dictate that they will work together. In other words, TMW, as I've heard, directly mechanizes a mechanic that creates distance or trust, rather than screwing around with different THAC0 progressions and stuff. Rather than have us working together because your low THAC0 has tactical interactions with my ability to cast Cure Light Wounds, why not have us work together because our character sheets say "We will work together"?<br/><br/>Maybe it's flip to say "games too lazy to be innovative benefit from having mechanically dissimilar characters", but there you go. Maybe no game really benefits from MDCs, and it's one of those still largely unexamined sim-by-default artifacts that will take a few years to be recognized as historical accidents, assumptions so basic that it takes a while to see how arbitrary they are. <br/><br/>Or maybe MDCs are a rich substratum from which lots of cool play epiphenomena can emerge, and we should take a Burkean approach to them. They seem to work, and they've seemed to work for a long time, so we should keep using them.<br/><br/>It's a really interesting question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254196/#Comment_254196" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T01:18:30+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  1:18AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent covered this really well. <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=14" rel="nofollow">Go have a look.</a><br/><br/>"I can't teach you anything useful about RPG design if you persist in thinking that mechanical character creation or the character sheet have anything to do with the character at all."<br/><br/>That's not, like, <i>the last word</i> or anything, but it's required reading for this topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254252/#Comment_254252" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T10:04:39+00:00" title="February  1, 2010 10:04AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, that Baker essay reminds me of genetic biologists jumping through rhetorical hoops to avoid anthropomorphizing their subjects (where it would be easy to say "this gene wants to do X", they circumlocute using mechanical vocabulary so they don't have to deal with the vacuous contention that genes can't "want" anything). <br/><br/>We can cast the question Sam asked into Vincent's terms: "If each player has, as a resource, one character, to what extent does it matter that each <i>player</i> has different sub-resources connected to that character?

Each player makes up an action (short story) about what happens next. The to happen roll is set by another player's judgment of the action and the characters (subjective rather than number objective). <br/><br/>I have players described by a name - a picture - and a short description (often couched in a dialog). It is there to help evoke a mental image of the character rather than define what they can do. So Sherlock Holmes may de described thus...<br/><br/>"You are the world's greatest detective. You see all and deduce all..."<br/><br/>or in another game.<br/><br/>"Holmes is just coming off a Cocaine bender and is still bleary eyed. A new case is just what he needs to pull himself together."<br/><br/>You can see how the images lead to different assessments of what Holmes can do. <br/><br/>So my conclusion is that Color differences are usually enough because the feed our role playing imaginations in different ways and lead to different outcomes. Not all differences are caused by mechanical ones.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254300/#Comment_254300" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T12:32:06+00:00" title="February  1, 2010 12:32PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point about Matrix games, Chris.

Vincent's essay is generally insightful - I've read it a dozen times - in that it suggests that we don't have to shoehorn player resources into some stunted notion of a character description. That is genius stuff, opens a ton of design space, and reveals a deeper truth. As usual. We all struggle to comprehend the theoretical-critical issues in game design... but the theoretical-critical issues in game design struggle to comprehend Vincent Baker. Everyone should read all of Vince's "theory, hardcore" posts because they all have innovative thinking like that; sharing the link is a helpful move in that sense. <br/><br/>But that particular post has a few issues, and I think one of them counts against its germanenes here. We can agree 100% with Vince's point in his essay and still say "OK, when I say 'character sheet', we all understand that I mean 'player's notes to himself about possible in-fiction moves'" and so on, grounding our na\xefve D&amp;D vocabulary in sophisticated critical understanding. And then we can, I think, have precisely the conversation we are having now. When I said "maybe I'm wrong", I was inviting correction. Maybe I'm still wrong.<br/><br/>One other thing: Vince's dismissive tone in that essay has always bothered me, especially since he never validly argues that the old way of talking about "character sheets" is actually incorrect, just incomplete (and limiting). It did set me off a bit that you chose, John, the most polemic and least substantive sentence from the essay as a blockquote.<br/><br/>Edit to add: I'd be willing to defend my assertion that Vince's essay never successfully argues that "character sheet" talk has some absurdity in its implication, but in another thread, if that is interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254349/#Comment_254349" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T15:59:14+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  3:59PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh okay, dude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254359/#Comment_254359" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T16:24:20+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  4:24PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Come on, John, engage.

"Must characters be mechanically different?" isn't an engaging question. Everyone knows the answer is "no" and it's no big deal. Just in case that was a crazy idea for anyone, I linked the essay.<br/><br/>Another question might be "Should the characters in your game design be mechanically different?" But that's a design question that has to be explored in the context of a specific game. As an abstract question, it's meaningless.<br/><br/>I also think "Do you prefer mechanical differentiation?" is a weird question, since, yeah, sometimes? It's kind of like asking if you prefer games that use d4s.<br/><br/>[Edit: I don't need to prove that Vincent's article is relevant to the discussion. I thought it was, so I shared it.

If you have a table of 5 players each playing a fighter with identical stats and weapon preference and all that jazz you can still have a good time and tell a good story.  The only reason I start with that example is because I thought it might benefit from it but it doesn't.<br><br>So I think that a game that might benefit is one in which players choose roles that are different in function and the character is the mechanic.  Consider a game in which you are able to get 3 players.  Those players take the mechanics of Rock, Paper, and Scissors respectively.  How they react and affect one another is pre-set and perhaps the game itself only gives partial clues to each player.  i.e. Rock only gets statements that are in regard to nature, Scissors gets statements in regard to mechanical things, and paper gets statements in regard to people.  In order to get things done these characters who have very specific interactions with one another must determine who does what and how to piece that information together.  So while it doesn't matter if Rock has direction sense per se, if paper doesn't want Rock to succeed Paper declares it so and now it's up to scissors to foil Paper or allow paper to confound Rock.<br><br>my 2 cents                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255701/#Comment_255701" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T07:12:29+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  7:12AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>I figure they're just different enough to qualify as their own thing.
