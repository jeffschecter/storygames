Also, when I've played Fiasco, a lot of the magic of is in the interplay and exchange of ideas at the table.  That part, allowed to happen organically in play-by-post, will take forever.  That's not to say it won't work, but I think it'll be a very different experience.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335242/#Comment_335242" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-19T16:52:25+00:00" title="July 19, 2011  4:52PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't tried doing so myself, but the Fiasco Companion does dedicate a few pages (starting on p. 57) to tips on playing online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bazin" title="Bazin"><img alt="Bazin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bazin">Bazin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335253/#Comment_335253" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-19T19:16:30+00:00" title="July 19, 2011  7:16PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neko Ewen: Thanks - I bought the Companion too, so I'll take a look there.<br/>\n<br/>\ntork: I know a number of fairly successful Fiasco games going on in other communities - I'm not worried about it not working well - it will be different, but so is everything else you PbF.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335300/#Comment_335300" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T06:00:03+00:00" title="July 20, 2011  6:00AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out the <a href="http://rpggeek.com/thread/606945/were-totally-f-ing-up-rpg-geek-competition-the-f" rel="nofollow">Fiasco PBF contest</a> that was held over on RPGGeek.  You can see a number of different playset's games (or at least the beginnings of them).  Also check out this <a href="http://rpggeek.com/thread/616716/fiasco-via-internet-best-practices" rel="nofollow">thread</a> in which a bunch of the people involved give advice on doing Fiasco by PbF.  The companion has some good advice as well.  After playing online, one thing I discovered is that you can't play around with the timeline as much as you could in a normal game.  A jump or two backwards or forwards in the timeline is OK but because of the slower pace it is harder to keep the timeline straight.  Linear timelines are obviously the easiest. Also, I'd strongly recommend having whoever is not involved in determining the tilt write up a short synopsis of the game thus far so that everyone can review what has gone on in the past weeks of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
