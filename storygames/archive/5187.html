What would be gamma testing?<br/><br/>My guess is that gamma testing is when someone teaches, learns or plays a beta tested game, in the absence of anyone who was involved with either the alpha or beta testing. That probably falls under the category of "publication," though. :P<br/><br/>What do you think gamma testing is? What useful feedback could you get from gamma testing that alpha and beta don't already provide, if any?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117080/#Comment_117080" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T06:45:42+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  6:45AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ie gamma testing is what results in the ubiquitous "second edition"?<br/><br/>That sounds about right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117082/#Comment_117082" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T06:58:18+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  6:58AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If beta is getting feedback from people we've met or contacted, maybe gamma would be unsolicited play from folks one doesn't know? So it could be based on their contact with a beta testers, or just general interest from seeing a game online. The benefits that gamma testing could have are that these folks don't know you from Eve, so their feedback might be less biased by personal connections. They don't mind breaking your heart by saying your favorite part of the game sucks--and could know less about your intent for the game, so would be better tests for the eventual sale of the game.  However, you'd likely know less about their play styles and preferences, so you would know less about what their play probably looked like or how you can predict other people's play experiences based on theirs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117091/#Comment_117091" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T08:35:46+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  8:35AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Working in the QA field in the video game industry, what I can tell you is this:<br/><br/>Alpha testing is when you're looking at the bare bones of the product. Most of the features are still not added, and little testing outside of mechanic feedback is really done because we all know those features are not there.<br/><br/>Beta is when 50%-90% of the game is complete. There are full, complete portions that groups can certainly test and run through, although it's likely you won't be able to do *everything*.<br/><br/>Then there's Final Candidate time, where we are told this is going to (hopefully) be the one to be shipped. All the minor problems are put aside and only major issues (crashes, show stoppers, standards violations) This is also the time where we'd do 24 hour shifts, rush for full 100% completions and pray the thing doesn't crash or eat the console so it gets out of the office.<br/><br/>I haven't really heard of "Gamma Testing" but I would assume it would ensue after the game is released. Like for patches, 2nd printings or downloadable content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117098/#Comment_117098" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T09:19:37+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  9:19AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, alpha testing is a term that already has a meaning.
