The caves turn out to be full of monsters! It's touch and go for a while, but they eventually manage to kill all the monsters and get the treasure.<br/><br/>2) A chick with a sword and a dude who can do magic decide to see what's on the other side of those mountains no one's ever been over. The mountains turn out to be really tall! It's touch and go for a while, what with the cold and the avalanches, but they eventually manage to cross the mountains and make detailed maps of the valley beyond.<br/><br/>3) A chick who makes swords and a dude who quietly studies magic are minding their own business when suddenly their village is attacked by bandits. They fight back, but it's really scary! They watch their friends and loved ones die! It's touch and go for a while, but they eventually manage to kill all the monsters and turn to the grim task of burying their dead and rebuilding what's left of their community.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In standard D&amp;D fantasy, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> would absolutely be an adventure.<br/><br/>In The Real World, "adventures" throughout history have been much more like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, but in standard D&amp;D terms, crossing some mountains doesn't sound very adventure-y.<br/><br/>Thinks like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> happen all the time in The Real World, but only a clueless dick would call them adventures. In D&amp;D, I don't think that scenario would be considered adventure either, would it?<br/><br/>So what is it, again in standard D&amp;D fantasy terms, that distinguishes Adventures from just plain Dangerous Situations?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218968/#Comment_218968" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T08:57:42+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  8:57AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be honest, in my experience with D&amp;D the adventure is whatever scenario the DM has planned, or if it's a more sandbox game, what the plyers go do that involved some sort of challenge with the expectation of reward.

He has a Home. Home defines him in some way, whether that means he lines up with Home's qualities, or deviates from them, or rebels against them entirely.<br/><br/>Then, the protagonist <i>ventures out</i> (etymology attack) from Home. He enters a place that is Not Home. The rules here are different. There's something out here that the protagonist wants, but in order to get it, he's going to have to come up against conflict, springing in some way from the clash between Home (represented now solely through the protagonist himself) and Unhome (represented through his entire environment).<br/><br/>The amount of attention paid to Home varies, as does the actual nature of Home and Unhome -- sometimes they're places, sometimes circles of people, sometimes more metaphysical, philosophical, or abstract. But that basic principle holds. It is what unites Homer, JRR Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, Robert A. Heinlein, Joseph Conrad, Rudyard Kipling, James Fennimore Cooper, Robert Louis Stevenson, and others under the single banner of "adventure."<br/><br/>EDIT: to be clear, the article is about using D&amp;D to do adventure Story Now                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219104/#Comment_219104" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T13:36:15+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  1:36PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should have been more clear: I'm not talking about <i>an</i> adventure, in the "adventure module" sense.

(3)  really ought to be, but you won't get your D&amp;D; group playing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of 'story', (3) is right on the money. The protagonists go through a series of trials and emerge changed at the end of it. (2) has a few possibilities for this, (1) probably has more, but (3) is the daddy for 'Hero's Journey' goodness.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, in terms of (1), the heroes emerging changed is reinforced completely by the system (if we're playing D&amp;D;)... they probably found some kewl magic items, and maybe gained a level, and some kewl feats / powers / etc. And as much as we may sniff at this being 'meaningful character development', it's how meaningful character development is defined within many systems.

The adventure starts when Odysseus is trying to get home and is sent radically off course by Poseidon into utterly uncanny places. (Odysseus is still "at home" while packing up from war to return to Ithaca. That's within his range of expected stuff. Although, interestingly, in <i>The Iliad</i>, Achilles' adventure began when he went to Troy despite having been told by the Oracle that he would die -- the invincible Achilles enters Not Home when he gets to a place where he can be killed.)<br><br>However, note that in both of those examples, the protagonist is trying to get back to Home.<br/><br/>But, whatever, it's not <i>just</i> going from Home to Not Home that makes adventure. It's having something you want, <i>and</i> trying to get it, <i>and</i> facing conflict sourced from the Home/Not Home clash.

I've seen an awful lot of people over the years start banging the "Hero's Journey" drum and I've got to say... I generally don't buy it. That doesn't mean you _can't_ do a Hero's Journey using D&amp;D; or other systems, just that there's very little of it going on. Especially in most D&amp;D; games.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; characters and an awful lot of other types for that matter are stuck in the Road of Trials stage. While individual "Adventures" (modules) might try and follow the Hero's Journey pattern, the _character_ doesn't ever actually grow. That's because part of the goal of D&amp;D; play is the opposite of the Journey: to keep on going. Part of the Journey in the mythical sense is that it ends. They've transcended and become Master of Two Worlds. The goal has been met, the McGuffin has been acquired, there's no reason to continue on.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; on the other hand is "keep going". You continue to acquire more and more power, the McGuffins are ways to tally the scorecard and by and large... characters don't retire. They're killed. Again, not saying that there aren't people out there that don't retire characters, just that it's not the _goal_ of the game usually.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's an "adventure" for D&amp;D;? It's people that are shaking up the status-quo. They're ridding the land of some ancient evil, they're pillaging places that no sane person would ever venture, they're landless in a medieval-inspired world, they're armed and prone to violence and law-breaking in societies that value law (as a general rule), they're using magic stuff which is a fundamental violation of the status quo...  they're an awful lot like various Trickster gods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's one chunk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there's the whole other chunk, where people are wanting to emulate Lord of the Rings. Nobodies that are "heroes" because they (again) buck the status quo, but aren't actually special (unlike D&amp;D; and an awful lot of myths) and in theory are able to die at any given point in time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, let's not forget the role that death plays.<br/>\n<br/>\nStar Wars (always popular with the Heroic Journey crowd) would be a rather different trilogy if you had Luke Skywalker actually killed at his Uncle's farm and had 4 more people show up to carry on the Skywalker role in the first movie and then kill each one. Number 5 gets to learn that Darth is his father and gets his hand whacked off. For Empire, let's go ahead and kill Solo a couple of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nLord of the Rings? You'd have so many people dead, you could walk to Mordor on their corpses and never touch dirt. The Taltos novels? I'm not sure they'd be quite as popular is Vlad got killed and replaced a couple of times a book.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Heroic Journey can provide some interesting ideas in terms of constructing rpgs and adventures, but... D&amp;D; isn't really about the Heroic Journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think "D&amp;D; adventure" generally means "violence and violation of the status quo".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219397/#Comment_219397" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-19T07:38:42+00:00" title="July 19, 2009  7:38AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because we know that in star wars and Lord of the Rings, their were in no way uses of violence to keep a minority down or violence against people of colour or parables of such. (That would be those shifty evil yellow skinned bastards with the elephants and everything the empire did against every non human race more or less ever). You want to look at mythology for less violence and keeping of the status quo? Good Luck. <br><br>Basically yeah, Dnd (and most adventure games ) do have to kowtow to playibility over being a finely written novel, in that automatic success is not terribly fun, and they have to manage several players as apposed to a writer who only has to manage himself and whose "players" always show up on time and never dies unless he wants to (don't bring up the my players have a life of their own bit). <br><br>I really don't think what you accuse Dnd Adventure of is terribly that different from the regular sort you see. Here's too more examples for you. Lets try Indiana Jones and Doctor Who. Seems to be a lot of violence and violation of the status quo, complete with some cheesy we gotta save indie/the doctor threw horribly shiny Machines of god (literal McGufferins or Regeneration also known as , Hey we gotta get a different actor for the doctor because we've been playing so long). I mean look at that warehouse full of McGufferins at the end of ?Raiders of the lost ark? (where they put the ark of the covenant). Its almost like the Mcgufferin is just one of many...<br><br>But Yeah, I think you could do a lot worst for  the definition of an Adventure than "violence and a violation of the status quo". I would probably put down something like "intentional violence and intentional violation of the status quo" because I dont think the Shire had a particular adventure when wizardly dude fucked with it for revenge. You could definitely catch lots and lots of myth and pulp  under the definition, which I think is promising.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219399/#Comment_219399" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-19T07:49:12+00:00" title="July 19, 2009  7:49AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2009 7:49AM by Graham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>1) A chick with a sword and a dude who can do magic descend into some mysterious caves in search of treasure.
