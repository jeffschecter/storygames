                    For those who don't know, So Long Sucker is a game invented by John Nash (the guy from A Beautiful Mind) and a couple of friends.  The rules for the game can be found <a href="http://www.lucs.lu.se/Courses/Spel/Parlor/Sucker.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a>.<br/><br/>Now, I've been working on and off on an RPG (found <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=d9s27gq_0fbqk55" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a>) that involves some very similar aspects: extremely simple rules, competition between players, deal-making and deal-breaking.  Of course, my game isn't quite as elegant (or brutal) as So Long Sucker, but I'm definitely looking at involving the basic concepts... I'm not entirely sure how it would work yet, but the draw of such a game is incredibly strong.<br/><br/>Has anyone ever played So Long Sucker?  Any thoughts on mixing role-playing concepts with it or other political/intrigue games like <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/483" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diplomacy</span></a> or <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/265" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intrigue</span></a>?                </div>

I've never played but it sounds pretty awesome. I love competitive play like this. I'll see if I can get anyone to play it with me.                        </div>

Yeah, those rules seem a bit dated in their terminology... still mighty playable if you get in the right frame of mind, I would suspect.  <br/>The game is designed so that, to win, you not only have to make an alliance with another player, but you also have to betray that alliance.  I'm thinking that putting the players in the context of playing characters in a vicious political setting might make the alliance and betrayal aspects of a game like So Long Sucker less personal, and therefore getting in "right frame of mind" a bit easier.                        </div>

I've never played Diplomacy, but Intrige (note the spelling <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> is friggin' <em>nasty</em>! It is literally impossible to playâ€‰â€”â€‰note I said play, not winâ€‰â€”â€‰without screwing over someone, and normally most of the other people playing at one time or another. It actually has a reputation for having ruined several friendships (so has diplomacy, but I think Intrige's record relative to how widespread it is is even nastier).<br/><br/>Somehow, even with the concepts of edge play and whatnot, that seems to go against some fundamental tenets of designing for fun. It is possible that the broader context of a narrative could cushion the blow some, although that may encourage an unhealthy level of My Guyism.<br/><br/>As long as your looking into pure negotiation, friendship-ruining games, though, you might want to look at <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/249" rel="nofollow">Lifeboats</a> (also know by its original German name Rette Sich Wer Kann)                        </div>

Aw, come on... both are listed as titles!  I really knew the original spelling... Really!

I don't know... Diplomacy is still a hugely popular game, and competition in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Games like Capes and Amber, and even the con scenarios for Burning Wheel, promote inter-character betrayal and carnage.  I wonder if setting up clear in-character situations and premade conflicts that promote particular alliances and betrayals might help to take the personal sting out of the politics.<br/><br/>edit -I thought of another example of deal-making and betrayal that doesn't hurt anyone's feelings and the separation of player and character helps: The Mountain Witch.  Everyone knows from the beginning that the other characters can't be trusted, and yet the actual play reports sing with how fun it is to not only betray the rest of the group, but to watch your samurai be betrayed himself.                        </div>

                            My above comment is merely expressing political discomfort at the knowledge that these were the same fine folks we had working at the RAND Corporation during the Cold War. I don't doubt it might be an interesting exercise in game theory (proper). It's entirely possible a game called "MAXIMIZED BOMBING YIELDS by Robert McNamara" could be well-designed as well.<br/><br/>But uh, forget about my gag-fest for now. It's a neat pick, Chris. I'm a sucker for elegant game theory -based game designs (funny that phrase would be rare), so I'll probably check it out when I have the opportunity. I'll look forward to any AP reports in the meantime.<br/><br/>Hey, I'm not so much of a weenie to not be able to enjoy the occasional game of <i>Diplomacy</i> with friends. <i>Diplomacy</i> gets a bad rap for being a total bastard game, and it really <i>can</i> be a cruelty-fest when everybody's new to the game and thinks the "rules" will carry them, but if you read up on strategy from players who have been playing a while (particularly play-by-mailers), there's a huge accumulated body of etiquette that goes along with doing the actual backstabbing and other hairy stuff. And it's more than about "don't be a jackass," being polite is essential to winning the game against anyone but novices.<br/><br/>I've somehow never even <i>heard</i> of <i>Intrige</i>.                        </div>
