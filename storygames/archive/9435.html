I'll say again: get up with a posse of at least ten folks and play several rounds of the game. One way to handle the learning curve is to have No First Night Kill or First Night Scrying, and go straight to the first day lynching... and that victim is the Moderator, who then runs the nights. That goes a LONG way toward making the first lynching more random (i.e. rather than either the poor fucker in the red shirt or the hairiest person always being first to go, because the villagers know nothing and no veteran players are there to do the Usual Tricks).<br/>-----<br/>But maybe Traitor will change your mind, when we can see the actual rules and what knowledge rests where and who can acquire more?<br/><br/>(Hint, Chris!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209106/#Comment_209106" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T11:21:48+00:00" title="May 26, 2009 11:21AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>There is... for the Seer (and the Little Girl--but that alternate role is almost broken).

There's nothing like that in Werewolf, especially if you're a Villager (and most people are).  If you're a Villager you spend your time attempting to sift through the bullshit of others, and if you've got a special role, you spend your time attempting to bullshit the villagers and get them to kill who you want.<br/>I'm not saying there is anything at all WRONG with this.

I mean, as David guessed and I admitted, I've only played it a few times, and that was all... 6 years ago.  But I enjoyed it.  It was fun.  It was just that when thinking about it later I came to the conclusion that the only strategy involved was in learning more or less how to manipulate people socially, and how to identify social cues and behaviors in the other players.  Maybe my problem with it is that I'm not really all that great at that kind of social stuff, so I wasn't skilled at the game.  There's not a lot of room to try to use logical arguments.  If I'm not a werewolf and someone is trying to talk people into lynching me, what do I say?  "I'm not a werewolf!  He's obviously trying to turn suspicion away from himself!"  but that's what everyone says.<br/>I dunno.  Maybe, like David says, if I played it more and more frequently (which is to say, at all) with the same people, I'd learn some effective strategies.  That may very well be true.  However, with the game and variants I know of, I'm fairly confident that it's not the kind of game I <i>want</i> to play regularly.  And yet, I've always been very fascinated by it, so I'd love to see something similar that is more in line with my preferences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209169/#Comment_209169" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T17:58:12+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  5:58PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't understand paying money (in this case $15) for a werewolf game that can be explained in thirty seconds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209172/#Comment_209172" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T18:12:58+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  6:12PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AYtT? makes use of a whole lot of cards with full color artwork, if that helps any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209175/#Comment_209175" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T18:36:18+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  6:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>I don't understand paying money (in this case $15) for a werewolf game that can be explained in thirty seconds.</blockquote>And yet there are a bunch of them.

Not to say that U.S. games are not well-designed, just that in terms of retail interests, having a heavy box justifies a higher price and profit. Greg Stolze's often said that if Chess were designed today, you couldn't sell it because the box was too light. :P<br/><br/>Perhaps that's too harsh though. Maybe it's just like folks buying chess sets? You can cobble together a chess set from stuff around the house and a grid drawn on a piece of paper, but it's not the same as having real carved pieces in your hands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209233/#Comment_209233" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T08:35:58+00:00" title="May 27, 2009  8:35AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>I don't understand paying money (in this case $15) for a werewolf game that can be explained in thirty seconds.</blockquote>\n[...] In this case, however, the game looks like it may be different enough to be justifiable.

It's not a re-skin; it's a re-design. Most significantly, it keeps all players in the game at all times (if I read the review right).<br/><br/>As for the price-point, a couple of facts about Looney labs (disclaimer: I am a Pyramid game designer and have been a Looney Labs Demoer).<br/>* It's all made in the USA, which (obviously) makes it a tad more expensive relative to Chinese-made products.<br/>* Their form factor (that box size) has been chosen based on retailer requests vis a vis visibility on the shelf (i.e. they have made card game boxes bigger to help drive sales--no altogether altruistic, but they definitely have love for the FLGS).<br/>* They are a very small company (four employees?) with many products, and thus significant warehousing costs (all their products are voluminous--no stacks of 1000 rule books in a one square foot of floor space). Couple that with the production run sizes they have to hit to get the best prices, and you can see that their "rent' is a MAJOR factor in their operating costs.<br/>* They will not retail in "big box" establishments, because they want the smaller, owner-operator businesses to survive the "Wal-Martization" of the US.<br/><br/>So, all-in-all, it might be more expensive than that new Magic Starter Deck, but that's the nature of a cottage industry. The most significant way in which they could cut costs would be to use production facilities (and even warehousing and fulfillment) with which they do not ethically agree. Believe me; I have spent a LOT of words, on and off their mailing lists, trying to find a way to enhance their market penetration by reducing costs or courting major retailers. They would rather stay small and stay "good," as they define it.<br/><br/>Worth an extra 15% to 25% out of MY pocket....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209408/#Comment_209408" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T12:26:19+00:00" title="May 28, 2009 12:26PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2009 12:26PM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, what Mike said.  Hi, Mike!<br/><br/>I don't think there was any particular NDA, and it's almost out.  Jeff Abramson has a review <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/394475" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  <br/><br/>In short, there are four key roles: the Keyholder (good), the Traitor (evil), and two wizards.  The wizards look, sound, smell, and I presume feel and taste, absolutely identical.  Only they know which one is which.  All of the other players are Guards.  <br/><br/>The roles are dealt out.  The wizards "go to sleep" (shut their eyes).  The Keyholder reveals emself silently.  The wizards get their good and evil roles randomly assigned, face down so only they know which is which.  The traitor is not revealed.  <br/><br/>The good wizard wants to find who the traitor is so ey can kill em.  The evil wizard wants to find out who the Keyholder is so ey can take the key and destroy the world.  The traitor wants to find out who the evil wizard is so ey can tell em who the Keyholder is.  The guards want to find out who the traitor is so they can point em out to the good wizard.  <br/><br/>Essentially, everyone but the wizards knows who the keyholder is.  No one knows who the traitor is except the traitor.  Everyone knows who the wizards are, but no one knows which one is which except for the wizards.  There's a lot of "I'll bet you're the traitor!" and "I'm not the traitor" and "You must be the evil wizard", lots of paranoia and table talk until someone actually tries to identify who their quarry is.  <br/><br/>That's it in a nutshell.  Jeff explains it better than I do, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209409/#Comment_209409" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T12:28:31+00:00" title="May 28, 2009 12:28PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2009 12:29PM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and there are rounds.
