You don't know for sure, and that's the worst part. The city on the moon is drowned under a white and waveless sea, and the salt-crystal towers and spectacular windows of stained ice, the alabaster ribbon roads of your home are all gone, melting into the waters.</p>\n<p>In your howling anguish, you did something terrible to yourself, and you who were an angel are now two, a star hanging quiet in the firmament and a human, immortal but still made of flesh and pain, walking the earth of mortal men.</p>\n<p>The pain is lessened by this, but it isn't gone, and you have forgotten what caused it. In your forgetfulness, your human half falls into self-destructive patterns of hurt and shame. He lives a hundred lifetimes, and each one is marred by your grief. in every life, he is betrayed, or perhaps he is a liar, or a cheat, or a scoundrel, and he does not know why.</p>\n<p>But in every place there are people who suffer more than he, and he is drawn to them, to help them and to heal them, or perhaps merely to protect them, or to judge them. And in this act, there is an awakening. Power spreads its wings in his heart. Now maybe his voice flattens mountains; maybe he can speak to the singing birds or push a sailing ship with his breath.

As for TSoY, I've already started rereading it with this in mind (as picked up on by Daniel).  Although, I've always thought of it as being for stories with Big Goings On, so I'm having trouble picturing using it in stories where Little Things Are Everything.  (Those aren't formal terms as far as I'm aware; I just like using capital letters.)  That's probably just a bias from never having actually played it, though.

All the games I've played revolved around the characters' personal motivations.  If TSoY is good at facilitating big-picture play, it is because the protocol for framing scenes makes it easy to hit the high points and move quickly from one scene to the next; but at the heart of these, too, are the characters' individual concerns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230599/#Comment_230599" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T11:36:07+00:00" title="September  8, 2009 11:36AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Burr</cite>Although, I've always thought of [TSoY] as being for stories with Big Goings On, so I'm having trouble picturing using it in stories where Little Things Are Everything.

So you don't necessarily roll e.g. to shelve books at the library, or to fix the clock. But you do roll when you need to forgive someone for something, if that was your issue. I think this goes way beyond TSoY being a good generic system; it is a really good mechanical fit for the setting and themes.<br/><br/>You know, the more I think about this, the more convinced I am that this is a game I could run. I do love Haibane, and I love <i>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</i>, and I've spent a lot of time thinking about framing devices and dream logic in the story gaming context. Maybe I'll show a few eps to my group and see how they feel about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230699/#Comment_230699" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T19:51:47+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  7:51PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure if it's something you're going for, but I think it was very important for the feel of the story behind Haibane Renmei:<br/><br/>The author (that is, the person who did the original art and light novels) himself has no idea what the fuck anything means in the world.<br/><br/>The guardians, their wordless language, and the bells? Brainfart.<br/>The underground crystals and the language of the ancients? Brainfart.<br/>The wall, the voices from the wall? Brainfart.<br/>The truth behind the setting and the story? Author has no idea, doesn't think about it.<br/><br/>So basically what's left is this surreal setting which is created basically though a sort of controlled randomness. In otherwords, creative brainfarts of pretty colorful scenery material to be used as a backdrop of a human(oid) drama.<br/><br/>It's what led to all those strong elements in the anime, which perpetuated the feel of the anime, of "big things that exist or are out there, that have apparently deep mysteries, which are never explained".<br/><br/>In other words, I'd be hard pressed to begin a Haibane Renmei themed game without putting in a mechanic or social convention for the creation of these mysteries and the absolute forbiddance of explaining them or unraveling their mysteries or "getting to the bottom of anything" in play.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230706/#Comment_230706" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T20:47:01+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  8:47PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>In other words, I'd be hard pressed to begin a Haibane Renmei themed game without putting in a mechanic or social convention for the creation of these mysteries and the absolute forbiddance of explaining them or unraveling their mysteries or "getting to the bottom of anything" in play.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This has long been the core of my theory for making good fantasy settings.
