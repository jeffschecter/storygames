Are you looking for feedback? If so, what kind?</i><br/><br/>The rules are complete, the game does come with tips for the GM but there are no scenarios. But I think that considering the subject coming with one shouldn't be too difficult (and yeah, I'm lazy)<br/><br/>Considering feedback, one can dream of an AP report but any comment on the game mechanics is welcome. Is a rule too obscure ? Do you think they lack something ? Is something vital missing ? Etc.<br/><br/><i>What makes you interested in this game?</i><br/><br/>I did my military service in and around Sarajevo in the 1995-96 winter. I always wanted to do something about my experiences there.  The point is I wanted a game that put player's in face of agonizing choices. No heroics, no machismo bullshit. War is ugly and it doesn't turn men into heroes, it turns them into dogs, at best. I wanted a game allowing to tell this kind of stories. The ones you see in <i>Iron Cross</i>, <i>The Americanisation of Emily</i> or <i>the Thin red line</i>. <br/><br/><i>Mechanically what are the hooks?</i> <br/><br/>Characters are defined in broad strokes but there is one very important game mechanic at the core of the game : Traumas.<br/><br/>There are four of them : Violence, Guilt, Indifference and Fear. Represented like this :<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/derives_english.jpg"/><br/><br/>In a nutshell : using a Trauma can save your ass (Violence = kill more people, Fear = step away from a conflict, etc...). each time you use them they go up by a point.<br/><br/>The problem is, once the traumas reach a certain level your character is fucked up in a way corresponding to the higher trauma (Depression, self-destruction, etc...)<br/><br/>The problem is, to survive you'll most certainly have to rely on them.<br/><br/>Another mechanic is Frustration. AFAIC I never read anything in a game about war that deals with those aspects of military life : boredom, incompetence and all the little things the military have thought of to keep up a level a frustration in their troops and that have nothing to do with the enemy. Allowing them to unleash it once on the battlefield<br/><br/><i>What does the game do that other games don't, or what techniques does it collect that aren't found together elsewhere?</i><br/><br/>I never found any game that allowed me to tell the kind of stories I wanted. Grey ranks and Carry are tied to a specific war and time period. I wanted a game that allows me to play a <i>Forever War</i> game one week, and the uprising of Madrid in 1807 the next. And I wanted a game that focuses on things weren't covered (imho) in other games. Concerning the specific techniques see above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182452/#Comment_182452" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T13:35:23+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  1:35PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just downloaded it, <br/><br/>After the first quick read threw impressions. <br/><br/>Uggh Trauma , Trauma as story motivatior/starter/punishment<br/><br/>Classical storygameisms, (Obviously we dont need to know about the rifles the soldiers are shooting or if they kill what they are shooting at, ITS ABOUT THE SOLDIERS not that) <br/><br/>Actually in detail some of the trauma, its much less heinious than my first impression. Some really neat bits that pretty effectively emulate survivor guilt, etc. <br/><br/>I found the big peace sign, and lack of easy to find rules to determine those personality and story changes that the game seems to want to be a big annoyance. <br/><br/>I also find the repeated mantra that the war the soldiers are in doesn't matter (It could be korea or the first martian revolution) to be kinda a lie. The game itself seems to be thoroughly stuck in WW1, Vietnam, Perhaps WW2 just as the americans are coming in. This comes from its about the soldiers man, obviously those silly things like circumstances beside mental anguish have no effect. <br/><br/>The game seems to be flirting with the void, which can be good or bad depending on what you want from the game. I don't think the game would do Blackhawk Down, All quite on the western front, or Apocolypse Now unless the players were on board and basically ignoring the book at times. I think the game could do a decent trauma motivated ww1 movie, more like what happens in the year after the book. I think it would do an okay Jacobs Ladder with some poking in the right directions. <br/><br/>My biggest beef (if you can call it that at this point)  with it, is that any stress getting to the "Personality" motivation stage should just as likely result in suicide, or actual Shell Shock (you know PTSD, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ) rather than the wamby pamby wuthering hieghts of trauma and dispair that the game seems to want.

But as you point out the game lacks of guidance. The thing is I think I've gone as far as I could with my gaming group. Now I need other people to play it or at least read it to tell me what's missing. Thank you for doing that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>I also find the repeated mantra that the war the soldiers are in doesn't matter (It could be korea or the first martian revolution) to be kinda a lie.

It says that the Trauma mechanic is based on modern sensibilities. So yes the game is more fitted for "modern" wars. The game focuses on what wars have in common regarding a soldier's sanity. Being afraid to die, feeling guilty... These are not tied to a specific war. It's the focus of the game so differences between wars (say WWI and Vietnam) are, as far as rules are concerned, irrelevent (imho, again)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/> the wamby pamby wuthering hieghts of trauma and dispair that the game seems to want.<br/></blockquote>\nIn fact I wanted my game to convey the idea that there are no good choices in war.

BUT you set up play to " The point for the players is to limit the damage " . Is the character surpose to change or not change, its that feeling that they don't want to but are dragged kicking and screaming into it (against players and characters will) that leads to that dispair feeling. This seems like a game you cant win (which isn't evil, maybe its that kind of game, but it still feels conflicted) .<br/><br/>Perhaps a better approach rather than grit, and things that depend on the circumstances that you have cut out of the game (like the weapons and the war) to prevent/limit damage is to go gung ho with the damage. There is no defence, no limiting the effects of war and as such focus on that rather than the other way arround. In this way the characters can grow perhaps a bit more organically to the player (rather than having growth be something that happens with the player fails to play well ).<br/><br/>either way, I'll get out the way no for others.

The first draft of the game had precise effects attached to each level of Trauma gained. But finally it proved to be cumbersome and my players played their traumas"naturally".  When a player's gains a trauma level, he knows why. He made a choice to do so. So his interpretation of the character evolves  from his choice. The tricky part of running a Shell Shock scenario is to make sure player's have real choices, not force them to rely on trauma. One of my players prefered his character to die rather than see him become a violent asshole (choices are rarely that extreme though). <br/><br/>Plus there are mechanics which can be used to reduce traumas and actually make the players contribute to the stories of their characters.<br/><br/>But as I said, these are experiences with my gaming group and I'm the one who wrote the damn rules. That's why feedback like yours is needed.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/> I would definitely recommend this game for a read, and if you like this kinda game, A play. <br/></blockquote>\nThank you, I'll definitely quote you on that !                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi" title="AnttiKi"><img alt="AnttiKi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.veljeskunta.info/anttiki/antti4_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi">AnttiKi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182759/#Comment_182759" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T22:53:53+00:00" title="December 10, 2008 10:53PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Downloaded and skimmed through.

As the trauma levels 5 &amp; 10 do not have mechanical consequences, is it just the job of the player to portray his character? Or is GM or other players somehow responsible for this? Personally I wouldn't mind having mechanical consequences (for example, one trauma level goes to 10 =&gt; story ends for that character via an epilogue scene).<br/><br/>In other parts it seems unclear how to run the game, for example:<br/><br/>* who chooses the random events in R&amp;R scenes and based on what?<br/>* how to decide what level enemies the players will face? Any guidance on that?<br/>* is there any formulas for providing enough (= just too much) challenge for the PC's?<br/><br/>Seems to me that I for one would like some practical figures (\u0e23\u0e01 la 3:16) on what to include in one session. <br/><br/>Still, very interesting and I'm glad that you made this.

Glad to hear you liked them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wanmansou</cite><br/>What is unclear to me is a lot of the rules and judgement, especially where they should occur. As the trauma levels 5 &amp; 10 do not have mechanical consequences, is it just the job of the player to portray his character? <br/></blockquote>\nFor level 5 traumas there are a few guidelines (but maybe not enough as you point out). As I said earlier, the rise of trauma levels doesn't fall from the sky, it comes from the player choices. So far, in my playtests the players have played they're character accordingly because the choices are important enough that they knew that their character had changed.<br/>But maybe a little more advice would do.<br/><br/>For level 10 Traumas, my text probably isn't clear enough but this level <i>is</i> an endgame for the character.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wanmansou</cite><br/>* who chooses the random events in R&amp;R scenes and based on what?<br/></blockquote>\nThe traditionnal way : the GM's tells the player's the squad got some R&amp;R, he prepared some events and asks the player what they want to do.<br/><br/>The "hippie way" : the GM's choose events based on the player's choices for R&amp;R. Let's not forget that players have control over the rest of the squad too.<br/><br/>The player playing the sergeant has the ability to inflict punishment to other players too.<br/><br/>To make it short : events described are only examples. You can play out a Rest period or jump directly to another patrol/conflict scene. These can player or GM driven, that's a matter of taste and rules don't really support one way more than the other.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wanmansou</cite><br/>* how to decide what level enemies the players will face? Any guidance on that?<br/></blockquote>\nIn a nutshell : "common" combat, use the regular enemy troops (3 dice). Include Veterans when it fits the scenario (facing an SS Panzer division in a WWII campaign while playing a US recon squad for example). Use Elite only once or twice per campaign and expect casualties/trauma rise among the squad. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wanmansou</cite><br/>* is there any formulas for providing enough (= just too much) challenge for the PC's?<br/></blockquote>\nBeside the mechanical formulas above, what should make the game challenging for the PCs are the choices they will have to make.There are several examples p.14 and 15 of the rules.<br/><br/><i>The quickest way to learn of an imminent attack is to torture a prisoner : will you do it or take a chance and maybe get the information too late ?</i><br/><br/><i>Kamikaze attacks are on the rise. You're on guard duty, a man run towards you, holding something in his arms. Is it a bomb ? Or a dying baby ? Do you shoot him ?</i><br/><br/><i>You are peacekeeping soldiers, ordered not to displace population to avoid participating in ethnic cleansing. The problem is that if you don't help those people to go they will be slaughtered. What now sergeant ?</i><br/><br/>These are the true challenges of a Shell Shock session. The rest can be handled with the little advice I gave you above.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wanmansou</cite><br/>Seems to me that I for one would like some practical figures (\u0e23\u0e01 la 3:16) on what to include in one session.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is a tough one due to the nature of the game. The structure of a scenario will depend on the war you choose.<br/><br/>If you play a resistance cell in france in 1942 your scenarios won't be the same as in a game focused on the vietnam war.<br/>Once you choose a time period and what the squad will represent creating scenarios should come easy.<br/><br/>The Running the game chapter (p.14) as (little) advice concerning this. A Shell Shock campaign is typically comprised of three scenarios :<br/><br/>1. Baptem of fire : first patrol, first sabotage operation, first uprising, etc...<br/>2. The war turning point : stalingrad, the end of the Vercors maquis, Gettysburg...<br/>3. The end of the war (for the soldier's at least) : tour of duty ends, Berlin in 1945, the end of the uprising...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wanmansou</cite><br/>Still, very interesting and I'm glad that you made this.

Meanwhile, my mother was close enough to London to have classmates killed in the Blitz.<br/><br/>And when I had the opportunity as an adult I travelled to Vietnam specifically to see the people we abandoned so many years ago.

They fight for the smallest glimmer of hope - and when even that is gone, they fight just for the opportunity to die on their own terms.<br/><br/>GR is about individuals both fighting for their Humanity and finding their Humanity in an inhuman situation. SS wallows in the slow destruction of that Humanity regardless of the choices the characters or the players make.<br/><br/>Humanity isn't born into us; it isn't a right given to us by some god or anyone else. It's something we create and pass on to our children - something that has been fought for and defended at a terribly high cost. The people who can't understand that don't deserve to live in any free, civilized society (which, unfortunately, still leaves plenty of places to which they can move).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183189/#Comment_183189" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T11:55:26+00:00" title="December 13, 2008 11:55AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2008 11:56AM by Kobayashi.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see your point, but as I said before what interested me when I wrote Shell Shock was to see <i>what wars have in common</i>. I don't think it makes it irrevelevant regarding the subject, but, well, I wrote the damn thing ^^<br/><br/>I definitely understand what makes you tick about the game, but it comes from a different design goal. It's not not as much a flaw than a different perspective on the subject. As I see it <b>Shell Shock</b> is not what you're looking for in a game about war. I cannot change this without making it a totally different game. As you said other perspectives are already well covered with games like <b>Grey Ranks</b> (or <b>Carry</b>, and I'd like to take a look at <b>Black Cadillacs</b> too).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183241/#Comment_183241" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T16:58:44+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  4:58PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2008 5:03PM by Number6intheVillage.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Look, dude, I didn't want to hear your vicious jingoism in public, I certainly don't want it whispered to me.

You obvioiusly don't care anything at all about the people who have seen their loved ones die that way.<br/><br/>And, by the way, I'm assuming you're not a misguided fool. And I respect your right to be a self-serving coward. (I don't believe in over-arching moral structures.) But don't be a hypocrite.
