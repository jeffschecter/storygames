Sabe played Snargle, and was hilarious, providing lots of physical comedy.  Len played Naomi.  I was the titular Lady Blackbird.  Abram didn't show up, so the captain was an NPC and spent most of his time getting tortured in a seperate cell, and may remain an NPC.<br/><br/>Snargle scuttled out the outside porthole and went and sabotaged the engine room.  Kale picked the look on our cell, then went to break out the captain on his own, got in over his head, broke himself free, and went to check out the Owl to get a big buzzsaw to 1) break the binding chains holding the Owl in place free and 2) free the captain.  I went right up to the bridge, where Captain Hollis was having a wireless conversation with my father Lord Blackbird.  I revealed my identity to Captain Hollis and tried to get him to place the Hand of Sorrow under my command.  (I'm a noble right?)  Unfortunately, even putting all 7 of my pool dice in, I failed the Extreme difficulty.  Tim had a great failure narration:  "The Captain looks uncomfortable, and says he'll ask your father.  You hear laughing on the other end."  About this time the engines were exploding.  I convinced Hollis the ship was under attack by Uriah Flint's fleet, that the crew of the owl had kidnapped me, thanks for saving me etc.  Got an officer to escort me to the Owl so I could "retrieve my luggage."<br/><br/>(There was some procedural give-and-take here; I was pushing hard to social-fu people, which it seems the Lady Blackbird was all about.  Tim seemed reluctant to set obstacles for charming and commanding people.  There was also a situation where I wanted to push the off switch on the Wireless receiver while I was talking to Hollis to cut off my father; I felt such a thing should be trivial; Tim felt it was Extreme (!)- clearly we had different views of how Hollis, myself, and the Wireless machine worked and were positioned.  I declined to roll the test.)<br/><br/>Snargle gets onto the Owl, gets my laundry dumped on his head- gets a Banter point by narrating a funny scene involving him struggling to free his face from Lady Blackbird's undergarments.  The search crews are dispatched, the chains are sawed through, and we fly the ship away as marines storm into the loading bay.  Then Snargle flies the ship so we're outside the cargo bay, and Kale saws through the outer bulkhead into the captain's cell, where he's being interrogated by Hollis.  Naomi comes in and defeats Hollis and takes him captive.  She clearly wants to kill him.  I publicly announce to everyone that I am the Lady Blackbird (and buy off my Key of the Imposter) and make a deal with Hollis- I let him live, he lets us go, and he gives his word that he will trouble us no longer.  He does, and then I tell Tim I want a test to make it stick.  (I.e. roll the dice to make sure he'll keep his word.)  We maroon him on the top of his ship.<br/><br/>Clearly some conflicts between Naomi and Blackbird- I wanted to show compassion and honor to the crew and officers of the Hand of Sorrow, whereas Naomi wanted to kill them all.  I see now that that's kind of hardwired into the keys.<br/><br/>Counting up tags and stuff was kind of fun.  I had a situation where I drew all the energy from one of the generators in the Hand of Sorrow's cargo bay (I decided "Channeling" meant some sort of steampunk machine-sorcery) to 1) further sabotage the ship and 2) send a lightning bolt at a poor crewman, and ended up picking up 7 dice.  Len as Naomi was kicking all kinds of ass fighting people and defending people.  Sometimes it felt we were bringing in tags when we really shouldn't.  Brendan was a master of offering a complication, "I might get tangled up in this hose and end up hanging upside down from the Hand of Sorrow" and then getting a die to avoid that danger (Contortionist), but he ended up hanging upside down anyway.<br/><br/>Petty Magic seems really really weak by comparison, to pretty much everything else.  Not just Lady Blackbird's Stormbloodedness, but like, physical mundane means of doing stuff.  Kale wanted to get through the wall into the captain's cell; he could either cast his Shatter Spell (3 dice: Petty Magic + Shatter spell), or he could do a cool acrobatic maneuver to saw open the wall and jump in and get like 5 dice.<br/><br/>I think Lady Blackbird's going to pick up a version of the Key of the Commander.  (Which should put me into conflict with him, whether or not he stays an NPC).  She was giving orders to everyone- Naomi, Snargle &amp; Kale, enemy soldiers, and more often than not, they were obeyed.  I want to see Uriah Flint be another ex-noble (maybe Fireblooded to go with his name of "Flint").  I want to play again.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206972/#Comment_206972" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T16:25:01+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  4:25PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting, Willow!<br/><br/>Lots of fun stuff in here. I love how you took charge as the noble Lady and ordered everyone around. That's definitely the way I envisioned the character, too. Flint as an (ex)Noble and Flamebood is <i>awesome</i> and I wish I had thought of it.<br/><br/>Petty magic is supposed to suck. Kale can always cast one good spell (by committing most or all of his Pool) or he can do magic that leads to trouble. He needs someone to teach him better sorcery... maybe someone like that is around. :-) Most of the characters have a few glaring weaknesses in place to give the players an obvious place to spend their advances.<br/><br/>When there's a disconnect on obstacle levels, sometimes it helps to break it down. Like, "5, huh? Ouch. Okay, I'll try to distract him first by gesturing outside and talking about how far away home seems..." and then see if you can make a test for a smaller bit of the challenge. Success there might let you try for the original goal at a reduced difficulty level. That's just one approach, though. Each group will have their own methods.<br/><br/>I'm really curious to hear where your game goes next. You're off to a great start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan%20Day" title="Brendan Day"><img alt="Brendan Day" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan%20Day">Brendan Day</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207012/#Comment_207012" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T22:32:11+00:00" title="May 12, 2009 10:32PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It does help to think of Petty Sorcery as serving no other function than to invite trouble.  Even if Kale manages to convince Lady Blackbird to tutor him, he'll always be at a disadvantage when using that trait, because of the one-spell limitation.  I may assign a few tags to Petty Sorcery to reflect this, so that Kale can reliably mess things up by trying (and failing) to cast a spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a lot of fun with our first session, so I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that our Kale has always wanted Snargle to be his familiar.  A goblin can run errands and make himself small enough to sit on your shoulder, and they're always cracking jokes, unlike cats and owls.  Would Kale take this as a secret?  Once per session he can re-roll any failure if Snargle is nearby, but first Snargle must sign a contract, binding himself legally and magically to Kale.  He doesn't even have to read the contract first; he just has to sign the last page.  Some members of the crew might see this as a form of slavery, because they don't understand the subtleties of magic, or Snargle, for that matter.  Naomi Bishop certainly doesn't seem to have a sense of humor, that's for sure.  Kale could probably strike it rich betting on her in a fight, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207017/#Comment_207017" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T00:44:52+00:00" title="May 13, 2009 12:44AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man. The familiar idea is so great!<br/><br/>Petty Magic isn't quite as limited as it seems. You can only use one <i>spell</i> tag at a time, but you can add other tags on to that. So, if you learned Channeling and Spellcaster from Lady Blackbird (new tags) you could then roll with 1 + Petty Magic + Shatter spell + Channeling + Spellcaster, for 5 dice. Not too shabby. Still, thinking of Kale's magic as a source of trouble is a good thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207060/#Comment_207060" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T07:56:23+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  7:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think we discriminated between getting the table to laugh with a snappy remark vs. getting the table to laugh with physical goblin antics, for the Key of Banter.
