Now things have changed and we decided to play again keeping a lot of the setting details we already made. We have 2 players returning and one new player with another joining soon. Last week we got together made characters, did Hx and since we had a real late start we did not get to play out the normal day stuff, but I did manage to ask a bizzilion pointed questions as  we basically rewrote the old stuff from scratch using the original ideas as a springboard so I was able to fill out chunks of my worksheet and wonder about somethings.<br/><br/>So here is my question, should I go ahead and make some fronts up as I have more than enough to do so or should I wait till we have an actual 1st session of play to make them?<br/><br/>- Colin                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292219/#Comment_292219" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T09:23:11+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  9:23AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, my off-the-cuff response would be to ask if you think all your players have enough 'buy in' and/or are involved enough in all that stuff you can make fronts out of. I mean, if everybody is on board with the setting as established (even the new guy) and you have juicy conflicts that they'll be happy to get tangled up in, then I'd say go nuts and jump in. On the other hand if you just plain want to take it slow and crock-pot some stuff, that might be a nice change of pace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292223/#Comment_292223" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T09:28:16+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  9:28AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My advice: make a front or at least a threat or three, plus bring another first session worksheet.

But I wanted to make sure that there wasn't something I was missing that would occur while actually playing the 1st session, specially since the last time we played the 1st session for reals it went... well badly. <br/><br/>I definitely think the group has the buy in to hit the ground running, as one of the reasons we didn't get a chance to play was that they were too busy barfing forth apocalyptica while creating characters and working on our map while I filled out the worksheet. <br/><br/>And that is rad that the 1st session and front sheets are not mutually exclusive, there is some stuff we added that I am not sure where it goes yet or what it means, like some of the things I am wondering about. This may have been what led to my doubt about pushing on and making all of my starting fronts.<br/><br/>Can't wait to play this.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292488/#Comment_292488" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T08:06:06+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  8:06AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main reason to wait is that the first session gives you a better feel for what the characters are invested in.  If you're willing to revise your fronts -- or rebuild them from the ground up once you do have that feel -- then there's no reason to not make them before the first session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292510/#Comment_292510" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T08:52:35+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  8:52AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last night I sat down and went over the work sheet and made 3 threats from it and a few countdown clocks. I listed a lot of the NPC we made just on the cast list to see how they are once play starts then I will make them threats or move them to the home front when I make that. I am most definitely going to have to revisit these threats and either make fronts for them or move them to the home front at the least, if I don't just re-write them. In the end it feels kinda like a detailed 1st session worksheet which is go, I feel like I gots some stuff to work with tonight and yet at the same time it dosn't feel set in stone yet, we will see what the fiction does to it all.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
