There are a lot of games that include social conflict rules that can be used among and/or against PCs, but there also seems to be a common opinion that whatever the player says about the character should be absolutely true - without any question or doubt.  <br/><br/>From my side, I'm not a big fan of the social conflict rules I've seen, but I've used them a fair bit in games.  I had an earlier thread on this about how social conflict was often based on both sides being stubbornly fixed on their goals, and "win" by not listening or changing their position at all, and getting the other side to change instead.  I'm not thrilled with that for a lot of social interaction, but especially for seduction.  So I've never run a seduction by social conflict rules - but I have run various other persuasion attempts as social conflicts.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I like the idea of player-set difficulty as an alternative to conflict rules.  So rather than framing it as a conflict, I might ask the player for a fair assessment of how likely they are to be convinced.  I think I would like that better as a mechanic for seduction and many forms of persuasion.  <br/><br/>So, questions:<br/><br/>1) Is turning to dice to persuade or seduce a PC inherently jerk-like behavior?  i.e. The targeted player says they would refuse, and the persuader doesn't accept that but calls for a die roll instead.  I don't think so, but I'd be interested in hearing arguments otherwise.  <br/><br/>2) Any experiences or insight on using player-set difficulty for this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid" title="SavageHominid"><img alt="SavageHominid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid">SavageHominid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362404/#Comment_362404" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T12:13:19+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 12:13PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 12:13PM by SavageHominid.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Not inherently.

You get one of three responses.  You fail and the GM gets to do a thing.  You succeed and the person you're seducing has two things happen, mechanically - they're get a reward in the form of XP and they get a penalty if they resist - some further badness might occur.  Or you succeed and only one of those things comes to pass.

For instance, in a game where you bid Tokens against your opponent, and the higher bid wins, you're effectively setting the difficulty for their attempt. In "stake-setting" games or various permutations (like, say, Polaris, or Otherkind dice-type mechanics), you don't set the difficulty but you do effectively get to say what it's worth to you (or your character). The Polaris "But only if..." phrase is probably the clearest example. Apocalypse World also does this, in a slightly different way.<br/><br/>In Dogs in the Vineyard, you effectively get to say what it's worth to you not to be seduced. Is it worth an argument? A fight? Risking your life? This is also similar.<br/><br/>The neat thing about these mechanics, though, is they are relatively social-bullying-free. In a situation where you're simply asked to provide a percentage chance for your character's seduction, with everyone staring expectantly, there is some social pressure. You're wondering, maybe, "What do they want me to say?" or perhaps, "What kind of numbers would they find believable?" and those concerns could override your own wishes. In a straight-up social conflict situation, however, everyone *expects* you to fight hard for your side of the bargain, there's no social pressure to "give in" or provide a certain range of probability.<br/><br/><br/>(I agree that seduction conflicts are not inherently bad in any sense, when exercised by a group of mature human beings with an eye towards everyone having a good time. They are certainly an area of play (like character death in some games) that should be approached carefully and thoughtfully, however. It's worthwhile considering a phrase like, "Are you cool with this conflict, or would you rather we moved on to something that's more fun for you, like the impending Battle of Doom? We don't have to play this out if this way, we can choose another way.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362440/#Comment_362440" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T14:03:08+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  2:03PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 2:03PM by jhkim.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">@skinnyghost</a> Sure.  That sounds good.  <br/><br/>In Dresden Files, persuasion or seduction involves a social conflict involving the wearing down of Composure boxes, leading to eventual Concession or being Taken Out.

Are there games that say "I rolled my dice and you are seduced, no matter what you say?"

The difference in this situation is that if you're Taken Out with a social or mental conflict, you still don't necessarily change your mind, you just can't put up a fight anymore. The explicit mechanic in this situation then puts an onus back on the insistent seduce-or. You've pushed this person until they have multiple social Consequences (say, Flustered, Angry, and then Frightened), they are basically unable to say no to you.  You can say they give in to your seduction - what does that say about your character? The fact that you can't make it happen without causing consequences that last beyond the scene is pretty strong.  <br/><br/>And furthermore,  the loser still gets to say how.  The seduct-ee can still say they're reluctant, turn their head aside, sigh resignedly, tune out, get out of there as fast as possible afterwards, etc.  That still gives them some control over how it goes.  See p.203 for more on this.  The seducer only has a very limited degree of what they can control about the outcome.<br/><br/>All in all I think it's a pretty good compromise.  You can still get what you want by dint of your marvelous skillz.  But you have to really damage the other person in order to get something they don't want to give you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362459/#Comment_362459" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T14:54:36+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  2:54PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 2:55PM by Piers.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>In Dogs in the Vineyard, persuasion or seduction is just like any other conflict - with potentially different interpretations of what rolling in Body dice means.

While system is set up such that, theoretically, a player could end up in a situation where their character was seduced despite not wanting that to happen, in practice that outcome is more or less impossible:\n<ol>\n<li>First, the system doesn't actually allow stakes like "my character seduces yours," only something like "my character has sex with yours."  Whether it is seduction or not is an emergent property of the contest. </li>\n<li>Second, during the contest, the player has full control of the how their character's raises, blocks, reversals and take the blow responses are framed (at least, as makes sense in the context of the other player's moves).</li>\n<li>Finally, most of the time the resisting character will have enough resources that, given their ability to escalate, the only way the other character can win the contest is to escalate as well. At the point someone wrestles someone to the ground and puts a gun to their head, its pretty clear that this isn't seduction anymore--its rape.</li>\n</ol>\nAll that, pretty much brings what is implicit in this argument out in the open: seduction when the other person doesn't want to have sex either fails or it turns into rape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362466/#Comment_362466" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T15:24:08+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  3:24PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 3:24PM by jhkim.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The difference in this situation is that if you're Taken Out with a social or mental conflict, you still don't necessarily change your mind, you just can't put up a fight anymore.

The basic rule, as defined on page 203, is that when Taken Out, "<i>the character has decisively lost the conflict. His fate is in the hands of the opponent, who may decide <b>how</b> the character loses. The outcome must remain within the realm of reason\u2014very few people truly die from shame, so having someone die as a result of a duel of wits is unlikely, but having him embarrass himself and flee in disgrace is not unreasonable.</i>"  So the persuader gets to decide <b>how</b>, but the persuaded person can define the color and details of that "how".  <br/><br/>But in general, I agree with you.

The way Vincent uses the word "seduce" in AW isn't the way that the term is most commonly used:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Apocalypse World</cite>Seducing someone, here, means using sex to get them to do what you want, not (or not just) trying to get them to fuck you.</blockquote>\nHe's using it more in the "the spy seduced the diplomat to get the secret documents" way.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Piers</cite>Actually, Dogs is very interesting for this topic. While system is set up such that, theoretically, a player could end up in a situation where their character was seduced despite not wanting that to happen, in practice that outcome is more or less impossible:<br/><br/>First, the system doesn't actually allow stakes like "my character seduces yours," only something like "my character has sex with yours."  Whether it is seduction or not is an emergent property of the contest.</blockquote>\nI agree with you that this is the functional way to play DITV, but I'm not sure the rules say this explicitly. DITV is pretty vague with its advice about when to go to conflict and what things are appropriate to be at-stake in a conflict. Playing by the rules in the book I think it is possible to agree to "mind control" conflicts (although I think it's generally a bad idea to do so).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362521/#Comment_362521" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T19:38:14+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  7:38PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 7:39PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things I always try to get clear on when I play with a new system or group is whether or not I have complete control over my character's thoughts and feelings.

On a 10 up, take a String against them. \u2022 On a 7-9, they choose one:<br/>give themselves to you, promise something they think you want, give you a String against them.</blockquote>\nWhere a "String" is an emotional hold you have on that character, which can subsequently be spent to add or subtract from rolls involving them, hinder them, hurt them harder when you harm them, or place a Condition on them (like <i>terrified</i>). Joe Mcdaldno himself makes an excellent account of the effect this has on play:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Monsterhearts</cite>When you use this move, you have the opportunity to step outside of your character role, and speak like an author would. Describe your character\u2019s pouty lips, how the sweat rolls off their strong brow, and how they look silhouetted against the pale moon. Unlike other basic moves, this one can be triggered without a specific action being taken. If the player describes how arousing the scene is, without their PC actually doing anything other than standing around and looking sexy, the move can still be triggered. <br/><br/>This move implies something about sexuality, and particularly teenage sexuality. <b>We don\u2019t get to decide what turns us on.</b> When you make a move to turn someone on<br/>(with a character action or with scene description), the other player doesn\u2019t get to exclaim, \u201cWait, my character is straight! There\u2019s no way that\u2019d turn them on.\u201d That\u2019s a<br/>decision that we as players can\u2019t make for our characters. The dice are going to be the ultimate referees of what is and isn\u2019t sexy for these characters. Their own  sexuality will confuse them and surprise them; it\u2019ll show up in situations they didn\u2019t expect to find it in. </blockquote>\n(emphasis mine)<br/>However, and this is, to me at least, the most important piece of information by far; many other games could do with making this more explicit, and I applaud Joe for doing so with Monsterhearts:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Monsterhearts</cite>Regardless of the results of the roll, however, each player still gets to decide how their character reacts. Being turned on by someone doesn\u2019t imply or demand a reaction.</blockquote>\nThis certainly bears repeating, I think, in light of the thread which inspired this one:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Monsterhearts</cite><b>Regardless of the results of the roll, however, each player still gets to decide how their character reacts. Being turned on by someone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn\u2019t imply or demand a reaction</span>.</b></blockquote>\nYou can have the dice potentially force someone to have been successfully seduced by someone else in-game without taking away a shred of actual character agency.

The explicit mechanic in this situation then puts an onus back on the insistent seduce-or. You've pushed this person until they have multiple social Consequences (say, Flustered, Angry, and then Frightened), they are basically unable to say no to you.  You can say they give in to your seduction - what does that say about your character? The fact that you can't make it happen without causing consequences that last beyond the scene is pretty strong.<br/><br/>And furthermore,  the loser still gets to say how.  The seduct-ee can still say they're reluctant, turn their head aside, sigh resignedly, tune out, get out of there as fast as possible afterwards, etc.  That still gives them some control over how it goes.  See p.203 for more on this.  The seducer only has a very limited degree of what they can control about the outcome.</blockquote>\nI think we're reading the rules differently here.  The basic rule, as defined on page 203, is that when Taken Out, "<i>the character has decisively lost the conflict. His fate is in the hands of the opponent, who may decide<b>how</b>the character loses. The outcome must remain within the realm of reason\u2014very few people truly die from shame, so having someone die as a result of a duel of wits is unlikely, but having him embarrass himself and flee in disgrace is not unreasonable.</i>"  So the persuader gets to decide<b>how</b>, but the persuaded person can define the color and details of that "how".<br/><br/>But in general, I agree with you.  You've basically summed up my problem with such social conflict rules, in that they while they give power to socially skilled characters, actual use of those social skills comes across as bullying and/or rape.<br/><br/>I think people generally want to see social challenges as a 'problem' or 'contest' that a socially skilled character can tackle and overcome using planning and skill, much like a martially skilled character would  overcome an opponent in combat.  By that I mean they want an involved <i>process with nuance</i> - they dont want 'bang, youre seduced' or "pow, youre convinced!" any more than they want a "smack, youre dead" combat mechanic.  the most obvious way to implement that is this kind of bully/rape your talking about - I beat your 'mental hit points' until youre overcome using my 'persuade' skill or my 'seduce' skill.<br/><br/>Maybe if the tools a character has at hand arent 'seduce' and 'persuade', but something more subtle, then the process wont seem so ham-fisted.  Seduction and persuasion are ends, not means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362557/#Comment_362557" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T03:18:11+00:00" title="February 25, 2012  3:18AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm happy with the standard Forgista narrativist game solution, as exemplified by eg. <i>Sorcerer</i> mentioned above. In this model of thinking player-character relations are not characterized as "total control", whatever that dysfunctional train of thought means, but rather as a relationship similar to that between the Ego and Superego: the player is responsible for exemplifying the rational intent of his character, but we accept that this rational intent is no more influential over the character than it is over normal human beings in our reality: people can and do act from base impulses, even when their higher rationality would like to desist. Many games in this tradition include a system for social conflicts along the lines John outlines in the first post; the intent of this system is often simply to streamline a game by using an universal resolution system that encompasses social situations as well as other types of conflicts, but the outcome is a game that is particularly well-suited to this type of thinking. In this kind of game players set the agenda for their characters, but momentary emotionally charged moments for the character are often partially out of the player's hands: the character can escape a dangerous situation instead of staying bravely to face death, or they can break their marital commitments with a third person, or they can lapse in other ways from the unrealistic perfect vigilance that their superego would often request of them. It's a way to bring life-like reality to the game. Although the game texts don't usually delve into this in any great detail, the intent is that social conflicts are only used to cause momentary, emotionally charged snap decisions on the part of other characters: in eg. <i>Dust Devils</i> or <i>Primetime Adventures</i> you can't mind-control somebody permanently, but you certainly can convince them to sign some contract or whatever. I usually explain this to players by saying that social conflicts can make characters do things they will regret in the morning - meaning, after the current scene.<br/><br/>I call this relationship between the player/superego and the character/ego by the name of character <i>advocation</i>: you do not immerse in your character, it's not a one-to-one relationship between your emotions and your character's. It's perfectly possible for your character to feel attracted sexually to some other character who you as the player don't find appealing. Your task is to simply determine and express your character's thoughts, not to act as a full-body puppeteer. As long as you've made it known to the group what your character <i>thinks</i> (or, perhaps, would think were he not currently being seduced by the sights and sounds of the wonderful and vivid world he lives in), the procedures of the game will take care of what he actually does. In some games the rational mind is very powerful, able to brush aside most temptations, while in others the more or less natural tempter has the upper hand, resulting in a different overall feel to the fiction.<br/><br/>The above suits a narrativist game well for certain reasons (imperfect characters make good drama, is probably the most prominent), but I've found that I like this approach in a wide variety of other sorts of games as well. For example, our current D&amp;D campaign runs off this set of assumptions: players can't just declare that their characters are perfect and ever-vigilant murder machines, they need to prove this by Will checks and other systematic means. The player is simply not in absolute control of his character to begin with, and this shows constantly. Heck, the perfectly ordinary Initiative check already shows this, insofar as we're concerned: the reason for why one guy acts first and more often is that he is less hesitant, more decisive, more experienced, better prepared and better able to make split-second choices about what he's actually doing in a combat situation. The player who would try to game himself out of the initiative rules by "roleplaying" his character as particularly invulnerable to fear and hesitation would get no traction at our table.<br/><br/>As for player-set difficulties for social conflicts, that's an interesting idea. I like it for certain types of games. Thinking about it, we're pretty much already doing this in our D&amp;D game: the group prizes solid fictional positioning very highly, so much so that the players can be relied to set their own difficulties on matters where they have a firmer understanding of the fiction than the GM. For this reason, when PCs try to influence each other, I will usually ask the player concerned what his opinion is regarding the chances: could the character be compelled by something like this? Then we set the difficulty based on what the player thinks of the matter, as he's pretty much the expert regarding his character's nature. I can totally imagine how this would not work for a cynical group that'd be willing to lie about this sort of thing for momentary advantage, or one that simply played unbelievably dull characters, but for us this works fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362559/#Comment_362559" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T03:23:58+00:00" title="February 25, 2012  3:23AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2012 3:32AM by nikodemus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not really much for explicit stake setting, except for social actions directed at player characters: the player is the one who must play out the result of the roll, so getting buy-in is vital.

I was just describing what seems to be working for me over a wide range of different games.<br/><br/>The opposite notion of explicitly equating the player with the character seems theoretically interesting as well, but in practice it seems like such a hassle to my jaded sensibilities. We used to try for this all the time through the '90s, but the immersion is a fragile thing, and ultimately evidently not all that interesting for me outside of a few narrow genres and other special interests. Also, as long as you <i>don't</i> get good immersion going, I truly see the resulting superficial character depiction as problematic; too many types of games suffer when the players are given total control over their characters (usually with the unspoken or explicit idea that they'll try to immerse and have their characters act according to their nature), and they then proceed to execute that control in a disinteresting manner for whatever reason. Inserting mechanical pressures that require players to empathize with the emotional pressures their characters face are a realistic addition to this situation, insofar as my experience goes.<br/><br/>Mostly my point here, insofar as one should be needed, is that it might be useful to consider the issue of social mechanics or the lack thereof not as a resolution issue, but as an issue of player/character relationship. The game's core activity is often dependent on some relationship the player has with his character, whatever that relationship may be, and then you add in various rules mechanics that regulate that relationship, define it and put pressure on it. To me it seems that the most common types of objections people have against e.g. freeform social resolution or Forge-style social mechanics often originates in attempts to mismatch system procedures with a fundamental concept like player positioning towards his character. For this reason it's probably more useful to try to perceive what your own favourite relationship to your character is, as that'll help in choosing a rules-set that supports that relationship instead of hurting it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362612/#Comment_362612" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T12:38:00+00:00" title="February 25, 2012 12:38PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I don't want to distract from the (very interesting) discussion about immersion and character "control", I do want to point out that John (Kim) brings up a very interesting point about social conflict systems used to handle this kind of situation in play.<br/><br/>When social conflict systems are based on a "combat" model, or aim to portray conflict as a struggle where one person resists and another person comes out on top, it does place actions like seduction (whether sexual seduction, or just seduction via force of personality, charisma, charm) into the realm of conflict and struggle.<br/><br/>Inevitably, at some level, it feels like the winner of a social conflict "wins" by overcoming the resistance of an unwilling subject, battering them into submission by force.<br/><br/>What are games that present social conflict in a different light? Where do characters "get their way" in the fiction because they're just so lovable that everyone wants to please them? After all, socially-competent or extremely charming people don't so much engage in conflict and "win" as they simply attract favours and attention by virtue of being <i>just that cool</i>.<br/><br/>I can see some promise in mechanics like Apocalypse World or Key-type mechanics (where the whole table knows that there is a bonus or carrot for interacting with a character a certain way).

It got sidetracked in the middle with discussion of Burning Wheel's Duel of Wits - but stefoid had a bunch of mechanical suggestions on page 2, and I had these points in my OP:<br/><br/>1) In the big picture, social skills should be used more for winning and keeping allies than for defeating enemies. <br/>2) A group with socially skilled characters should be more effective as a whole than one without. Social skills aren't just about making other people obey you - they can help you and others work together. <br/>3) Social skill rolls should be required for social interaction - not just an option. Characters with low social skill should be the cause of conflict, not just bystanders or weak combatants if there is conflict. <br/>4) Social interaction isn't just about getting your way - it can also be about communication. Two people might be in conflict because of lack of social skill, because they don't realize their common ground. <br/><br/>To expand a bit on #3:  In many games, the player and GM first role-playing without dice, and social skills are invoked only when a socially-skilled character isn't satisfied with what they got by diceless means.  This means that basically, the non-mechanical role-playing is assumed to represent a <i>lack</i> of social skill, and social skill is something fundamentally different than that "normal" role-playing.  To reverse that, we might say that the normal role-playing represents successful social skill use - and when a character gets something by dicelessly role-played social interaction, then they should make a social skill check to confirm that.  <br/><br/>This way, we don't mainly represent a seductive character by special "force your will on others" mechanic.  Rather, we have mechanics that get invoked such that those who are <i>not</i> skilled at seduction tend to get rebuffed.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>The bare underling mechanics might be combative or competitive, after all, why are we rolling dice?

To be clear, I\u2019m speaking of creating a personality for the game character that is meaningful and personally significant for the player, in which the player has an emotional investment and upon which the player projects some aspect or perhaps many aspects of self image in the context of a social dialectic through which they wish to be perceived.<br/>\nThis is the unspoken norm in Role Playing Games today.   Note that this is separate from immersion, which is more of a subset of character investment, in that immersive play is not at all necessary for a significant and meaningful degree of player investment in character to be present.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think it is important to point out investing deeply in the character is decidedly not the only way these games are played.  Consider that we are talking about games here.   Games are traditionally played with game pieces.  Chess has pawns and rooks.  Monopoly has wheellbarrows etc., boardgames usually just have a counter.<br/>\n<br/>\nRole playing games \u2013 even before the term itself was invented \u2013 have playing pieces too.  They just happen to be called characters, and may or may not be represented by a little playing counter.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce upon a time when it was new, the context under which role playing games were played and understood by the participants was that of miniature wargaming, chess, and boardgames like monopoly.  It would have been very usual to invest a great deal of personalty or self identity on the wheelbarrow one moves around the monopoly board or the rook on the chess board.  Characters in roleplaying games were (and still are at some gaming tables)  likewise perceived of as little more than an expendable game piece with a handful of stats, the actions of which in no way are meant to be code for self.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was in fact BITD an active cautioning against identifying with characters as anything more than an expendable game piece. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, being games, actions of unknown outcome are typically resolved with dice, including especially ugly, cruel, and harmful actions.  Which is why a great deal of early rulesets are devoted to combat and fight resolution.  <br/>\nI would point out that people are so accustomed to mechanics for combat resolution that there is a failure to see how incredibly invasive and heinous such randomizing agony would be if characters are seen as self projections \u2013 at least as serious if not far worse than randomly rolling to see if one gives up ones virginity.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat constitutes fair and fun play is a matter of the context of the gaming group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362681/#Comment_362681" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T08:39:22+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  8:39AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DHBoggs</cite>I would point out that people are so accustomed to mechanics for combat resolution that there is a failure to see how incredibly invasive and heinous such randomizing agony would be if characters are seen as self projections \u2013 at least as serious if not far worse than randomly rolling to see if one gives up ones virginity.</blockquote>\nRight, skinnyghost I think had a good point about this earlier. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite> In the same way I can roll my dice and say "you take damage, your agency to BE ALIVE is summarily reduced."</blockquote>\nI think this is thoroughly accepted.

Holmes mentioned in his 1980 article how a character (particularly self-as-character) could be difficult for players, showing that this tendency was definitely known.  Some early RPGs like D&amp;D or Call of Cthulhu had relatively quick character generation, but also common mortality.  Many games soon tended to have more involved character creation, and also encouraged greater "script immunity" for PCs - such as Champions, Star Wars, and others.  <br/><br/>The interesting thing is that some recent games have disavowed script immunity, and increased character mortality again.  These include games of the "Old School Renaissance" - but also independent story games like My Life With Master, Apocalypse World, and many others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362826/#Comment_362826" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T22:27:30+00:00" title="February 26, 2012 10:27PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wasnt nit-picking Ed, I meant that sounds COOL and IM GOING TO HAVE TO READ THAT GAME AGAIN TO APPREICATE ITS COOLNESS!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: edheil</cite><br/>Sorcerer says that?

Character investment and self projection were business as usual already in 1980s. It doesn't mean everyone was doing them, but everyone isn't doing them now either. I'm not saying you don't have a point at all, but I can certainly vouch for my 1980s experiences involving character investment -- starting from day one.<br/><br/>My own experiences aside, I'm also pretty sure I can look at early game texts and find them supporting ubiquity of character investment. Just read up on the Braunstein games: it's pretty clear people were already invested in their characters before D&amp;D was ever published.<br/><br/>If I'm to take this seriously, you should modify this to speak about specific game texts directly. Ie. "Game texts prior to XYZ adviced against character invesment.", or "Prior to ZYX games didn't encourage character investment." -- and then cite some major texts to support your point. Right now, from where I stand, this seems like nothing but hot air.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can leave aside the generalizations and say "In the absence of character investment...".<br/><br/>...or it's possible that I'm completely misunderstanding your point because you mean something I don't understand at all with <i>"character investment and self projection"</i>, in which case I'm happy to be corrected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362848/#Comment_362848" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T05:08:41+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  5:08AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>In the same way I can roll my dice and say "you take damage, your agency to BE ALIVE is summarily reduced."</blockquote>\nI think there's a difference that's tied to game culture, though.<br/><br/>In many games most combats PCs engage in are more or less self-selected.

There are plenty of games in which your character can never be told what to do.

It's not a pleasant choice but you're not forced by a rule to go one way or the other.

Nothing's going to wear down people's composure in real life, though. Why would it? All that's really happening is they're playing a game, talking about fictional people and stuff. Nobody's autonomic nervous system has any reason to ring alarm bells, so you get the arguments that go around in circles forever.<br/><br/>We handle the disconnect fine when it comes to physical violence, because we recognize that as being A) outside of people's power to choose, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> outside of our power to simulate directly by role-playing. The problem is that getting worn down in an argument is just as physical and out of conscious control, and just as impossible to do by just role-playing it out.<br/><br/>Maybe it would help to locate the best scientific papers to hand around and convince people of this.

I don't think so, but I'd be interested in hearing arguments otherwise.<br/><br/>2) Any experiences or insight on using player-set difficulty for this?</blockquote>\n1) Absolutely not. Except when it is. Traditionally, most game genres are steeped in pulp. Whether they are D&amp;D, superheroes, or sci-fi, they - like most main stream movies - take a conceit for granted that Our Heroes may be stymied by physical obstacles of all sorts, but outside of that, no one talks them out of what they want to do.<br/><br/>On top of that, it's widely believed (if not inherent to American culture) that individuals have free will, and coercion only happens at the end of a gun (or equivalent, like a waterboard).<br/><br/>So, naturally, most gamers have these assumptions. And so, throwing that aside because an NPC has a high charisma is probably going to be seen as breaking a promise in most games.  More so if this is the first time it's come up at all, and the player is a target.<br/><br/>2) So, player set difficulty all depends on where the game falls into the spectrum of pulp-unrealism or realistic. <br/><br/>Though, personally, I try to leave room in the middle and individual players can decide how much control they retain or go with the flow. Most good social conflict systems don't require a specific outcome unless it is stakes, which players usually have full control in setting.  Instead of asking them how susceptible they are, specifically for the medium of the conflict, I instead might inquire about how vulnerable their character is feeling. Are they grim and focused on a mission, or tired and worn out? Did they just witness the death of a friend or the loss of their treasured magic sword? What emotions are filling them right now?<br/><br/>Use that to set the difficulty, and let them decide whether they get seduced or lost their cool in some other way that feels truer to the scene.<br/><br/>The intention of the conflict doesn't need to be the stakes. The NPC might be using seduction, but the goal might be to kidnap the PC, or to steal the microfilm.  Even if the goal is seduction, the PC can be left with control over how exactly it goes down. They might not get seduced, but being tempted was enough to "take them out" and lose the conflict. Or maybe they get angry and lose self control, or they get drunk and pass out. Just like combat, where the condition of victory is not always death - despite deadly methods in play - social conflict victory doesn't need to be<br/><br/>The consequences of losing any conflict could mean that time the PC lost control and now has to deal with the fallout. Or it could mean the time the player discovered something they didn't know about the character before. Maybe both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367059/#Comment_367059" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T01:38:57+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  1:38AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2012 1:39AM by Bad_Santa.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>I like the approach but I think it has to get handled very carefully.

While there is a way to have a character say no outright to a persuasion attempt, it is reserved only for when the character is being persuaded something impossible or completely unbelievable.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, you must embrace the situation wholeheartedly. If there is a particular kind of persuasion you don't like (seduction, for example) you can give your self infinite resitance to it. There are one two other ways to resist persuasaion: that of servile elusion. (buying or preparing everyone a drink of their choice) and barefaced subornment (bribing the other players with points form your character sheet.)<br/><br/>One player got upset when his character was seduced and tried to wriggle out of it, so we had a time out and I explained the premise a little better. He is somone who wants to "win" RPGs in their own terms. Once he had a handle on that, he embraced it wholeheartedly and turned it later to his own advantage.<br/><br/>This is a subject which fascinates me and it's often not dealt with directly. Is it, for example, possible to persuade a PC in 3rd Edition D&amp;D using an interpersonal skill?<br/><br/>Finally, Robin's new DramaSystem is designed to deal with exactly this - not procedural but dramatic scenes, and it does so in a rather neat and straightforward fashion. If this interests you, we are still looking for play testers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367456/#Comment_367456" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T08:03:45+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  8:03AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 8:26AM by 2097.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: 2097</cite>Bringing up a "craaaazy sex hangup" in a discussion about rape is frankly shocking.</blockquote>\nWell, saying "we're totes cool with murder" is pretty shocking too, that's my point.
