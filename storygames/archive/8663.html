This is what you do in it:<br/><br/>You drive a car with guns and stuff attached to it, and blow up other people in gunned-up cars in an arena while spectators cheer.<br/><br/>You do cool stunts and last-minute escapes to move the crowd, which increases your popularity, which helps you get sponsorships.<br/><br/>You occasionally get to do interviews, giving you the chance to increase your popularity further.<br/><br/>You develop rivalries with other drivers.<br/><br/>You customize your car's weapons, armor, and engine to suit your strategy.<br/><br/>You create a theme for your car:  you name it, decorate it, and design a signature weapon.  In addition to being fun, this helps you move the crowd (based on how much cash you spend on it).<br/><br/>You pick a song for your entrance music (a la professional wrestling); at the start of each match, everyone plays about 30 seconds of their song (in a stereo, in real life) as they are announced.<br/><br/>You use your cash rewards from winning matches, plus sponsorships, to buy new stuff for your car, repair stuff that's broken, and pay for hospital bills.  Eventually, you can earn enough to retire.<br/><br/><br/>So, here's the question:  is this a roleplaying game?  I can't decide if it is, or if it's just a wargame.  Or can it be both?<br/>I'm not really concerned whether it's one or the other; I just want to <i>know</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191650/#Comment_191650" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T09:37:13+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  9:37AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you play a role in it?

MotorClash's system is a lot like Burning Wheel, i.e. (scripting + opposed dice pools).<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I think the interviews clinch it: it's an RPG.<br/></blockquote>\nSo, you do the interviews in-character.  How effective it is (at increasing your popularity) is based on your driver's Attitude, plus any Kudos that other players (or non-players who happen to be around), give you, a la fan mail.  This, along with all the invitations to add Color (designing your theme, picking entrance music, etc.) is what leads me to think it might be a roleplaying game.

Heels are the bad guys, who fight dirty, and who the crowd (loves to) hate.<br/><br/>In wrestling, there's also little nuances like Tweeners, who fight dirty but are loved by the crowd (ex: Stone Cold Steve Austin), and then there's the whole issue of Turns, whereby a Face suddenly becomes a Heel or vice versa.

Just for the record, this is a blast.<br/><br/>We played freeform, but of course you can have rules that modulate players' ownership and interpretation of the simulation's outcomes, and other rules that plug story events back into the simulation if you like.  Even in the freeform case I mention above, we allowed our characers' shifting relationships to influence the teams we formed for the next race, which has mechanical consequences in the sim.  <br/><br/>My thought is that if you take a simulation as if it's an oracle, telling you facts about an SIS, and then you deglaze those crunchy bits with some stuff that humans relate to (kin, struggle, will, frustration, triumph, and so on), you make story game sauce.  To the extent that your players identify with a particular person in the sim (or in the sim's world, at least), and take that character's side in storytelling as an actor or an advocate, it's useful to call your game an RPG, because it sets expectations in a reasonable-seeming way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191681/#Comment_191681" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T11:35:17+00:00" title="February  9, 2009 11:35AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2009 11:37AM by Grant Davis.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think we can make judgements about the game without seeing specific rules.

Other than interviews, which only do one thing mechanically (alter your Pop), there are no mechanics for what happens outside of your car.  You could use this outside-your-car time to freeform, but there's no mechanics there to resolve any sort of conflict.<br/><br/><i>But</i> what if you use <i>the matches</i> to resolve conflict?
