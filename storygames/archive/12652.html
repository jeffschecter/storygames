I'd like to make relationship maps for my:<br/>-  <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/ageoflegend4e/" rel="nofollow">Earthdawn-Pathfinder</a> campaign  (that would include PCs, current story,  and world events/NPCs yet to happen)<br/>-  a map for creating the "world" of a DC comics "Ultimate Teen Titans"  game  (if interested to help me with SPECIFICS of this map, I have two threads you'd be welcome to read/help with at <a href="http://www.atomicthinktank.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=37473&amp;p=712114#p712114" rel="nofollow">M&amp;M</a> and <a href="http://bashtalk.org/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;p=4435#4435" rel="nofollow">BASH!</a> sites)<br/><br/><br/>But I'm not sure how to go about it...<br/>I'd like thoughts,  suggestions,  advice on:<br/><br/>-  why are these helpful  (to help sell my players on the idea of using/updating)<br/>-  what kinds of things do you add?<br/>-  how technically/physically  do you best make/write/draw  these  (any links, programs, samples?)<br/>-  what are the best questions to consider/ask<br/>-  what is the best format?   both  graphically  and  for info  (like:  what should it look like,  and  what notes: name/class/race/organization/1st apperance, etc...??)<br/><br/><br/>any of the above  and  any thing else you could suggest to give guidance...

This is a really useful tool at the table, because people can reference it both as a memory-refresher and a source of connections, complications, and hooks.<br/><br/>Here's the R-Map for our PTA game, The Big Store, <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/big_store/rmap_russians.pdf" rel="nofollow">at the beginning of season one</a>, and at the <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/big_store/rmap_russians_season2_ep1.pdf" rel="nofollow">beginning of season two</a>.<br/><br/>This game revolved around some iconic locations, so those went on the map. THe lines denote general relationships of some kind, and power within each faction flows from top to bottom. But it is mostly a hash. <br/><br/>Looking at those two shows a lot of fascinating changes, and comparing them is another way to generate stories and conflicts. <br/><br/>I did these in Visio, because it is what I had. The tools and format make no difference.<br/><br/>How We Came To Live Here builds this into setting design, and over continued play you continue to develop and tweak a relationship map for your village. It works well and is a very good implementation of the concept.<br/><br/>EDIT: One more thing about my maps above - they are very dense, but not all those people showed up in-game. Many, many people were there to prompt player investment, as tempting hooks, as handy fall-backs. I threw some promising people out there and maybe half of them stuck. At the same time, even if they didn't appear as NPCs, they gave the impression of a big, complex world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284137/#Comment_284137" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T10:28:19+00:00" title="August  3, 2010 10:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite><br/>1.  to look at a GM building the world:  to plan and plot stories,  to make connections between NPCs/organizations,  and to make sure my ducks are in a role with those things<br/><br/>2.  for players to look at  (an editted version without secrets)  to offer me suggestions on where/how THEY fit,  all to give me GM ideas on where to go take the story  and  know what the players think</blockquote>\nThese purposes - brainstorming and bibliographic tools, basically - don't require any rules.

I started with the set of circles for the PCs and how they were connected, and expanded from there. Two PCs are brothers, draw that line. They father is a duke, circle him and draw that line. They meet a neighboring duke and some of his vassals and make rivals out of them, draw a bunch of circles and lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have on there dotted lines, representing relationships the PCs don't know about, but which are influencing events. Likewise, people they haven't met yet get big parentheses rather than circles; when they meet them, I join it into a circle.<br/>\n<br/>\nNodes on the graph can represent either a person or a group; my latest version features groups of werewolves and trolls, for instance. This is shorthand, the details are in my notes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI version it by going forward in pages, redrawing, and adding. As I flip through my notebook, I get a very satisfying evolving picture of the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking some locations need to be on the relationship map. The big fortress full of monsters they partially explored, or some of the places they know about but have not gone to. Maybe I'll represent them as rectangles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nocker" title="Nocker"><img alt="Nocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://sites.google.com/site/angrynocker/_/rsrc/1306682518924/jdr/images.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nocker">Nocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284234/#Comment_284234" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T01:15:01+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  1:15AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a game whose entire system is based on a relationship map : <a href="http://verge.legendary.org/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Verge</a><br/><br/>I love this idea where everything mechanic-y that the players need to know is on a single sheet in middle of the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
