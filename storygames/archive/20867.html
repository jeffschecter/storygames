It could be linear, random, or player choice.<br/><br/>Just looking for different mechanics and approaches created over the years for inspiration.<br/><br/>For example, once an encounter winds up, you ask the players, "What do you do now?" The players will inevitably want to move locations or trigger another event.<br/><br/>What was 4E's mechanic? Was it the same and it was just that the encounters were more modularized?<br/><br/>What about games where there are point pools players can use to select next encounter/event. Does that exist?<br/><br/>What about games where players create the next encounter themselves. What games do that, and how does that work?<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Johnn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458085/#Comment_458085" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-14T18:56:33+00:00" title="November 14, 2016  6:56PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting topic, Johnn.<br/><br/>But, first, I'd like to know:<br/><br/>Are you assuming, in your question, that there are a limited number of pre-determined "encounters" (like "prepared" fight scenes, for example)?<br/><br/>That would narrow the scope of discussion quite a lot; otherwise, you'll get a huge variety of options, since just about every second game popular among players on this forum has a different take on this.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458092/#Comment_458092" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-15T01:24:53+00:00" title="November 15, 2016  1:24AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I played D&amp;D 4E, the DM (that was supposed to be a rotating duty in our group, but the group didn't hold on to D&amp;D long enough for a full rotation) prepared a string of encounters stringed together by a thin excuse of a plot, and we just went through the encounters in order. Sometimes, the DM had prepared two alternate sets of (equivalent) encounters and presented us with an explicit choice of which route to take: "Do you storm into the castle by the front gate, or do you look for a secondary entrance?" Between encounters, we devoted a couple minutes to in-character conversation, which amounted mostly to posturing, banter and benign bickering - then the DM framed the next scene, introducing us to the next encounter in the sequence. That was more than enough fictional context for engaging with the tactical minis game which is the 4E combat encounter (we <i>did</i> have some skill challenges too).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458099/#Comment_458099" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-15T16:48:40+00:00" title="November 15, 2016  4:48PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me like two different questions:<br/>1.) How do you choose the <i>next scene/encounter</i>?<br/>2.) How do you implement the <i>process of transition between two scenes/encounters</i>?<br/><br/>For the first, there are many ways for this. If you need a "tool" for this, you could look at the <i>Location Crafter</i> (same author as Mythic GM Emulator).<br/>But in general, this question is very tightly linked to the system or game you are playing.<br/><br/>For the second question, you can look at how <i>downtime</i> is handled. <i>Blades in the Dark</i> has some original approaches to this. Another thing <i>Blades</i>  does very well: it cuts completely the prep/planning time between encounters. So you jump right into the action. <br/>Of course, you might as well skip the "transition time" completely and continue with the next scene two weeks later (or a year earlier in a flash back).<br/><br/>Hope any of these answers head in the right direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458101/#Comment_458101" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-15T17:51:11+00:00" title="November 15, 2016  5:51PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although the game never found much traction, I always liked the rules in Vincent Baker's <i>Afraid</i>, where Fallout choices made you tick any numbers of boxes on your character sheet, like "Lost", "Alone", "Unprepared". This would determine where you would find yourself next. For example, if you had to check off "Lost" and "Alone", we would know that the next encounter for your character would take place with her by herself, and in a place she didn't recognize or know how to navigate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JohnnFour" title="JohnnFour"><img alt="JohnnFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JohnnFour">JohnnFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458115/#Comment_458115" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-16T02:30:07+00:00" title="November 16, 2016  2:30AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Paul, BeePeeGee nailed it.
