The comfortable glow of consoles, glassware, fluorescent lighting... ah, it has indeed been too long. I have meticulously prepared all of my instruments. The surgical steel instruments are cold and menacing; the whole room a perfect, sterile environment. The subject is strapped to the table. It is time for the <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">extraction</span></b> to begin.<br/><br/>The <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">extraction</span></b> for today is <b>Eoris: Essence</b>.<br/><br/>What you may have heard of this game:<br/>* It features tons of art<br/>* It costs nearly $100 US<br/>* It was developed by a team of gamers from Columbia<br/>* There was a bit of a (ahem) problem with pre-orders: Two years after accepting money, and the product is still not available to purchase<br/>* The character sheet features a lot of dots<br/><br/>More can be found at the public site for the game, <a href="http://eorisessence.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://eorisessence.com/</a><br/><br/>So then, let us begin the <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">extraction</span></b>.<br/><br/>On the surface, we have... A beautiful two-book hardcover collection, combined in a durable cardboard slipcase. The books themselves give no indication as to their use (they both feature just the title "Eoris"), however one has a picture of a tree on the featureless black spine, the other a picture of a wolf-like animal. An interesting choice. The tree-book appears to be the "world guide", the animal-book appears to be the "character and rules guide". <br/><br/>Looking further, we see that every page has high-resolution full color art printed on sturdy paper. Each book has about 220 pages. There is no index, in either book.<br/><br/>I will now cut away the skin to reveal the parts that lie underneath.<br/><br/>Oh my.<br/><br/>There is much of interest here indeed.<br/><br/>While on the surface, it appears to be yet another fantasy game but with beautiful art, there are some very interesting developments here. So very much here to <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">extract</span></b>, I barely know where to begin.<br/><br/>Let me start as I always do, by discarding the <i><b><span style="color: #990000;">debris</span></b></i>: The pieces and parts that make us the muscles, the tendons, the nerves of the game but don't show us anything new, nothing worth <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">extracting</span></b>.<br/><br/>The setting is a planet the size of... well, let's just say it's fairly large. Countries in the lands of Eoris are as big as planets. There is no sun, either, just a disk of white light that hovers far outside of the planet. There are races, families, eras, epochs, all excruciatingly detailed. The races tend toward the angelic or animalistic.<br/><br/>The system is a dice pool system of d20s. You roll a number of dice, usually between 3-7, looking for successes, numbers that meet a threshold. Think World of Darkness with d20s. The game focuses on skill rolls, with a fairly average combat system. There are also rules for social combat.<br/><br/>Magic is fairly straightforward: You have a bunch of spells, you roll to see them go off.<br/><br/>We'll discard the above and go straight to the parts that have been <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">extracted</span></b>. <br/><br/>Turn your attention to the character sheet. It (one of three, but for the "main race", the humanoid Sil) can be found here: <a href="http://eorisessence.com/Images/Sil_Sheet.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://eorisessence.com/Images/Sil_Sheet.jpg</a><br/><br/><b>1) Emotional States and Appearance Charts</b>: If you look into the character sheet, there are two grids of dots: The left one is the Appearance Status Chart, the right one is the Emotional Status Chart. They are entirely different charts, but they have the same general mechanics behind them.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, you and the GM work out where on the chart you start. Where it starts is totally up to your decision, given what else has happened before the adventure began. The more fights you get in, the more bloody, ripped and torn your outfit gets: That moves you slowly towards Menacing and Rough. Your ability to Intimidate increases, but your ability to win over people with seduction or etiquette goes down. However, you have a skill called Appearance (applying makeup, patching up your clothes, washing yourself quickly, etc) which you use to move yourself back towards Approachable and Elegant, which gives you bonuses to meet people or converse with nobles.  You can also set a "this area of the grid is where I'm at by default" area: For example, a courtier might always hang out in Elegant and Menacing, which makes it harder to empathize with others, but that's where their "zone" lies: It is harder to leave that zone, and easier for the character to return to it.<br/><br/>Emotional Status is similar: The more Secure and Exalted you are, the more dice you get to spend on social skill checks. The more Depressed and Frightened you are, the higher the dice penalties for social checks are. The Emotional Status is different than Appearance, because there definitely is a "good area" and "bad area". Unlike Appearance, where there is "a quadrant where your character likes to be in order to do the things they like to do". Interesting.<br/><br/><b>2) Everything is on the Sheet:</b> This isn't so unusual, but still worth noting. Aside from a few spell names, pretty much every single skill and ability in the game is right there on the sheet. You don't have to go through lists of abilities or the like choosing which ones you do or do not want: It helps character build happen faster. The downside is that there are so many dots on the sheet, but it's still quite easy to handle.<br/><br/><b>3) Essence Die:</b> Worth noting. For every single roll you make, one of your dice is considered the Essence Die, and rolled separately: It is another color from the other dice. It works as normal, however it acts as a "Fate Die" of sorts: Any time a 1 is rolled on it, your character fails or at least does not completely succeed. Any time a 20 is rolled on it, your character succeeds or, if the result is a failure, you fail but in a way that sets you up for success. It is like the Ghost Die in Ghostbusters, for those who know that classic game: It makes a normal success spectacular, a normal failure abyssmal, and nuances in between.<br/><br/><b>4) Alternate Character Form: </b>It is said after the character creation section: "Some characters have an alternate form". It is not understood which characters have alternate forms, but that's another issue. The characters, any character, can transform into an alternate form. So you basically create an entire second character to use as an "alternate form". I am not aware of any games that have you do this, and while it can drag on character generation to nightmarish lengths, it is worth mentioning.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Extractor" title="The Extractor"><img alt="The Extractor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://sites.google.com/site/therpgextractor/home/extractorpic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Extractor">The Extractor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291689/#Comment_291689" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-05T20:36:10+00:00" title="September  5, 2010  8:36PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2010 9:09PM by Andy.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>5) Three Different Character Types:</b> There are three major races of character in Eoris: Sil (humanoid... ish. Often angelic, with wings), Xylen (animal-like), and Kalei (...uh... upon reading most of the book, all that we really know are "they hate Xylen", and are some kind of celestial creature). Still, each has their own unique rules, and are written on their sheets. The Sil have Divine Aspects, which work differently than the Xylen Powers, which are nothing at all like the Kalei abilities generated from a long lifespan (perhaps involving reincarnation? Unsure). The races aren't totally different from each other to the point that they use entirely different rules for skills and attributes, but the races are varied enough that each comes packed with its own rules-set. <br/><br/><b>6) Impulses:</b> Those 17 things on the right of the character sheet, emotional attributes like "Pride; Valor; Lust" and so on are the Impulses. The game has you score them however you want. You not only choose how many dots you have in each (with no "pool" to choose from: Just "assign as many as you want, no limit"), you also set a success threshold for each. So if you think your character puts Duty above all also, you might give the character four dots, and a lowered success threshold.<br/><br/>Then, when your character is put into stressful situations, the GM might have you roll to resist taking a particular action: Roll against lust or take up the concubine's offer. Roll against Optimism or cheer up the orphanage. Roll against Curiosity or you will be unable to resist going into the dungeon. Now, the rules are pretty clear that while the GM might call for such a roll, it's actually the PLAYER who decides when and what to roll. This makes this idea worth <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">extracting</span></b>. If a player gets put in a situation where they really don't know what they can do, they can simply roll against their own character (what they determined earlier their character's personality was like), and go with the flow based on the roll against the Impulse.<br/><br/>For that reason, more than a straightjacket it is instead a source of roleplay inspiration for the player, especially when they think there might be a problem between what the Player knows and what their Character knows: "I know this dungeon is dangerous, and most normal characters would avoid it. But I think my character might dive into it. I really can't decide either way. I'll roll her Greed/Curiosity/Duty to see if she goes or not, then". Interesting.<br/><br/>They have no other game effect than that: A way to determine what your character is like, and how they might react to certain situations.<br/><br/><b>7) Story Categories:</b> Each character has a set of things called Stories: They are a little like "Merits" in World of Darkness, in that they are usually like bonuses, but they give your player a bit of "history", as well as offer something to the GM to "mess with". There are a system of bonuses/drawbacks called Talents and Hindrances... Ah, it's there on the discard pile: Nothing interesting. But Story categories are interesting.<br/><br/>They're mainly interesting because, again, there is no rules guidance for how to set the "level" of story category. There are no points to spread, no limits that have to be balanced. You could aim for an "uber" character here, and if the story calls for it, it's good. Each story category tells a little something about the history of your character. While they may give power to your character, they are more focused on giving an idea of where they came from, what they're about.<br/><br/>The Story Categories are Elements, Wealth, Gift, Compulsions, Social Standing, Valestia (Aura powers), Spiritual Circle (Sil character powers), Consciousness (Kalei character), Years after Awakening (Kalei). I won't explain them all here, as many of them are tied into other rules or setting elements, But it is interesting in that most of them have Levels from 1 to 8, and again there are no limits other than agreement between player and GM.<br/><br/><b>8) The Beautiful Weapons Section, and the Stupid Axe:</b> Normally I would have added the typical gratuitous weapon lists to the discard pile. However, in this game they are worth mentioning. It is another place where the beauty of the game in its art direction works for rather than against the game. Each weapon is given a name, and in each class of weapon (axe, spear, sword, etc) there are tons of examples, again all given a beautiful 3d-looking art piece which includes its stats.<br/><br/>Looking through it, you don't grab a "Sword, Spear, Axe Shield and Armor". You grab a Kaeran, Karenthil, Oblian, and Klavie mail with Brakthlen shield. Each and every weapon gives you a spell ability. Normally this would all look like special "magical weapons", not the usual "long swords and shields". But in Eoris, you all start out with incredible-looking weapons and armor at no real "cost". This makes the game a little more than about the acquisition of the Next Cool Weapon, because you already start the game with the most incredible looking weapons of pretty much any RPG in existence.<br/><br/>..Except for the Orhind aka "The Dark". It is the favoried weapon by Hurin, a race of hairy... things. It looks like a curved axe where the blade goes beneath the grip. Meaning that you could never get enough leverage to really use it as a cutting weapon. Which means that this weapon is dumb. All of the other weapons look incredible and yet oddly functional. I have shown the Orhind to fellow researchers, and all agree that this weapon looks like a cross between an axe and a shield, without the benefits of either.<br/><br/>A picture of some of the weapons, including the Dumb Axe, can be found on the Eoris website, under Galleries--&gt;Equipment. You'll immediately know the Orhind when you see it.<br/><br/><b>9) The Depth of Setting:</b> Too much is too much. I rarely call attention to "the setting", but in Eoris it is so unique in use that some attention to it must be called.<br/><br/>It's huge. One of the two books is dedicated to it. 200 pages of history of a universe on a broad scale. About 30 pages on the creation of the universe where Eoris resides, in detail so fine and illustrations so profound that it's painful to realize that it will never be used in play. It's interesting to read, and as an art book this material is not too profoundly out of place. But as an RPG it seems very off to have so many pages dedicated to material that simply won't appear in that level of detail in the game. However, if every player in the group were to read it, immersion would be that much more profound. Perhaps.<br/><br/>It gets deep, very deep. Many games will repurpose an existing word for the things that exist in the fantasy setting: "The Shadow Lands", "The Great Observer", "Clans of Chaos", and so on. In Eoris, everything -- Everything -- is given its own unique fantasy name. Saeia can be used to interpret the Eos. That Eos flows through the Orus, and access to the Orus can be found through the Naie. It flows through the brains of all Shevat and Xylen. Because of the War of Twilight Spirits and the Black Howling, the Ystarian organization over the Twelve Great Ethnias limit access. This is a paraphrase of a few paragraphs of the setting text. And much of it is like this.<br/><br/>It is unique in that it paints a fantasy world very unlike others that have come before it. But it requires so much effort by the players to learn it. Whereas other games may have complicated rules systems, the rules of Eoris are pretty straightforward and even "easy" by standards of other games. But the setting, on the other hand, is the complicated part of the game. <br/><br/>This flip, this reversal... interesting. Very interesting. <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">Extracted</span></b> for further study.<br/><br/><b>FINAL OBSERVATIONS</b><br/><br/>I don't discuss the playability of a game. My tools and skills only exist to extract the unusual or new features of a game to lay them bare to observation. But, if pressed, I would say that this game is an interesting stab at the fantasy genre. It is definitely Western, with a "Neo-Pagan/Wiccan" feel in all the references to spirits and cosmic spiritual energy. The characters have an interesting depth where the Impulses make for characters that "jump off the page". However, the setting is terribly formidable to get into. Each player would likely need their own copy of this $100 game to "get into it". On top of that, there is no Index, so if you forgot where the explanation of the Sil Houses or the Naie are, you must go through the books by hand to find it.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it was hard to understand what the characters were supposed to do, who they were supposed to fight against. There is a small section called "Antagonists", but it simply presents three races/groups of insanely murderous creatures to kill: Nothing in the setting book seems to point to an enemy to fight with socially. In fact, the only contemporary (in the history of Eoris) antagonist referenced seemed to be "a group of pirates" off of a coast somewhere. Deep in the history section, there was reference of a giant war looming against the Ziel, another spirit-race... However, a paragraph later and the text explains that they were defeated a few millenia ago. Which again asks, "Who are the antagonists? What is there to do in This day and age?" This question has no easy answer, even after hundreds of pages of setting.<br/><br/>For reference during the <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">extraction</span></b>, I carefully examined the downloadable adventure scenario from the Eoris website. The scenario takes place a few hundred years "ago", during an era outlined in the history section of the setting book. This was interesting, because most games present to you the setting, the history, and intend to have you start playing the game "today". I put "ago" in quotes because Eoris apparently presents an entire multi-millennial history, and intends for the GM to determine which part in the history of the world to set the game, then create the scenario. So the long-dead Ziel don't have to be so long and dead in your game, they can be the Here and Now. This was interesting, and I attribute it to the artbook feel and presentation of the game. On the surface, the world is idyllic and peaceful with no struggles. But the game intends for you to read all of the history of Eoris, and set your games within its turbulent history.<br/><br/>In the end, it seems like too much setting to pursue. The rules are typical for role-playing games, but provide some very interesting twists and features not found in other games, If the setting were easier to understand and immerse into, I could see this game being a runaway hit. Unfortunately, as is, it is more a "sort-of" playable artbook. <br/><br/>Again, that is my casual and personal observation, not an observation attained through the <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">extraction</span></b> performed upon this work.<br/><br/>Until next time, associates. I will retire to a shower and meal, for these <b><span style="color: #00CC00;">extractions</span></b> can be quite tiring.

Now, to respond to some comments:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe McGuffin</cite>I am completely fascinated by the bizarre things I am hearing about this apparently ridiculously-crunchy World of Synnibar heartbreaker, but I don't really want to spend $100 on what is likely only to have comedic value for me, assuming I could even be assured of getting a copy.</blockquote>\nHmmm. I am not interested in the dissection of the "heartbreaker" term, but after examining carefully the <span style="color: #00CC00;"><b>extracted</b></span> parts as well as the <span style="color: #660000;"><b>debris</b></span>, I do not think a comparison to World of Synnibar is apt. <br/><br/>Synnibar, I have indeed <span style="color: #00CC00;"><b>extracted</b></span>. Back in my early days. My fingers weren't nearly as nimble, my mind not as sharp. But it was a game of outrageous power, combat, more combat, and more power. <br/><br/>Eoris, on the other hand, comes from a place of intense... for lack of a better word, "New Age Hippieness". There is power, to be sure. But more than power and combat and martial rpowess, the game focuses on things like:<br/><br/>Communing with spirits and being in-touch with the universe.<br/>Appearance, clothing, and their effects on the characters you interact with.<br/>Being social, elegant, and graceful.<br/><br/>It comes from a very different place from Synnibar, or RIFTS. While its too-huge setting might give the appearance of a power haul, it is far more subtle, refined.<br/><br/>I dare say that I find the world fascinating, interesting, and... elegant. Unfortunately, like a society, it takes a long time to immerse, to pick up the customs and nuances. Too much time for the payoff, perhaps? That decision needs to be made by the reader.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: drnuncheon</cite>This is actually pretty common in point-based games, especially those with superhero rules (Champions and its descendants). Eclipse Phase generates body ("morph") separately from mind ("ego") since body switching is common in the genre and setting.</blockquote>\nAhh, good catch. I have not seen it in a fantasy or non-supers game before, but well noted on Eclipse Phase. I found it more intriguing that the text simply said "Some characters can change form" but without explaining it any further: Which characters? Why? How? Mysteries, all. And yet, the unexplained nature has a bit of appeal to it. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: drnuncheon</cite>The personality mechanics remind me of Pendragon.</blockquote>\nInteresting observation. I have not looked through Pendragon myself, but I know that the moral elements are portrayed on a scale: "Are you X OR Y?" In Eoris, you can be X AND Y. You could even theoretically be torn apart constantly by 17 raging Impulses, most of them at war with each other at all times. The fact that the players set their own impulse levels and success levels for those impulses... it is an interesting mix. A guise of total player control over their character, while at the same time letting the player set the rate at which they can control the impulses of their own characters. It is kind of schizophrenic, but interesting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Great extraction, Doctor!  Thank you.</blockquote>\nThink nothing of it, it's what I do.<br/><br/>I plan on doing more later. It may not be soon. But those of my order are very interested in the unique elements that show up in even conventional role-playing games. And we lay those elements bare for all to see, to pick through them. We'll see more perhaps next month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291842/#Comment_291842" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T19:57:58+00:00" title="September  6, 2010  7:57PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2010 7:58PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: The Extractor</cite><br/><br/>Hmmm.

My admittedly ill-informed comparison wasn't so much based on mechanics, as the commonality of having an extremely dense and yet extremely arbitrarily designed world.  Things like Synnibar and SenZar are infamously power-gamey, but much of their reputation for hilarity comes from the extremely straight-faced presentation of an extremely bizarre world that seems bereft of internal logic.  They are clearly places created solely to game in, but ineptly presented in the loving encyclopedic detail of a Middle-Earth or, uh, some other well-respected literary setting I can't think of.  Something like, say, Glorantha or Skyrealms of Jorune, on the other hand, are plenty odd in and of themselves, but are well-crafted enough to let me suspend my disbelief.<br/><br/>Is Eoris a Synnibar or a Glorantha?  I don't actually know, but you are the first person I've seen on here or RPG.net to even hint it might be the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295715/#Comment_295715" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-02T15:03:45+00:00" title="October  2, 2010  3:03PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2010 3:04PM by MacLeod.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: The Extractor[/cite]Eoris, on the other hand, comes from a place of intense... for lack of a better word, "New Age Hippieness".
