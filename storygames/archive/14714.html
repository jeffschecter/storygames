Success.<br/><br/>Robot Daredevil Model <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> AKA "Cinco" (Jered) - a robot with adrenaline circuits. You've got serious thrill issues, dude.<br/>Psychic Warrior Buck Dharma - cover identity Roger Wilson (Jamie) - a veteran of the psychic wars, married to Donna who doesn't know he's a member of the Danger Patrol<br/>Atomic Professor Dr. Laser (Xander) - think Tony Stark, pretty much. If you need something invented yesterday, he's your guy.<br/>Ghost Detective Inspector Dracula - not just a ghost, not just a vampire, but a ghost of a vampire yo.<br/><br/>We made it through one action scene - we must have rolled five disasters, which is pretty crazy. Trouble at the Solar System Faire - the mathemagician and his quadratic gangs attack, while a mysterious fish-man (who was he working for) tails psychic Roger Wilson, and Cinco's sabotaged spaceship nearly crashes into the capitol building. Meanwhile Inspector Dracula investigates the castle of late millionaire Hamilton Hughes - only to discover Hamilton has become part of the legion of undead, with minions and traps to match. The castle is destroyed, volcanos erupt, Buck Dharma accidentally creates a magma elemental clone of himself, Dr. Laser's atomic power source nearly melts down, Buck's wife is turned into a vampire, a rift in time is created - all in an hour's work for the Danger Patrol. And the recurring quote of the night: "You get another danger die, because it's a fucking vampire."<br/>And Inspector Dracula may have put the undead Hamilton Hughes to rest, but Vampraham Lincoln is still at large, and has a sword.<br/><br/>GM-less worked pretty well - I thought it went sillier than usual but Joe said, "Oh no, this came out pretty straight." Xander thought the threats didn't hold together and that's true - but it didn't seem to matter, with our wrist communicators and rocket packs we could be where we needed to be and were one-for-all, all-for-one anyhow. We could have tied some things up in a suspense sequence later if we desired.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16VRyix2_WreL-uUsDlQLuG0cHgoshR31FxSzkPazv9A/edit?hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">I tightened up the doc some and here it is.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334681/#Comment_334681" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T13:58:54+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  1:58PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ooooooh.
