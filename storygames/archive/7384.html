Something like the radio talk shows use.<br/><br/>Synthezizers can this, but I don't want any other feature of these expensive tools than just assigning sound cues to specific keys.Is there a cheap / free solution for this? I would even do very very very little coding for this. Less than you can imagine.<br/><br/>EDIT: I think its name is "sampler".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164357/#Comment_164357" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T07:27:13+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  7:27AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2008 7:27AM by Ron Hammack.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay! Making music is my <i>other</i> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">life-long obsession</span> hobby, so this is something I can actually help with.<br/><br/>There's all sorts of software samplers out there, some free, some costing hundreds of dollars. However, I think a sampler is way too much tool for the task.  I think what you're looking for is a "soundboard"<br/><br/><a href="http://soundboard.com/" rel="nofollow">Soundboard.com</a> lets you make embeddable Flash soundboards with up to 50 megs of sounds. I haven't played with it myself, but it looks like it does everything you want, except for shortcut keys -- you can't hit a key to play a sound, but instead have to click on the title.<br/><br/>If that's a problem, or if you're looking for a non-Internet app, some half-assed Googling led me to <a href="http://www.zhornsoftware.co.uk/soundboard/index.html" rel="nofollow">The Sitter Downers Soundboard</a>, which does feature keyboard shortcuts, along with the ability to play multiple sounds at once, loops sounds, pause and resume sounds, and set the volume of each sound independently. It's also free, and in the couple minutes I spent playing around with it, seems like a solid solution for what you want to do.<br/><br/>A good source of sounds is <a href="http://www.freesound.org/" rel="nofollow">freesound.org</a>.<br/><br/>You'll also probably want some kind of audio editing software, so if you have, say, a sound clip with gunfire, explosions, and screams, you could cut out the screams at the end or split the gunfire and explosions into separate files. Again, the music production software that I use would be total overkill for the task, but I've heard good things about <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Audacity</a>, which is also free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164359/#Comment_164359" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T07:44:13+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  7:44AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used Audacity a fair bit.
