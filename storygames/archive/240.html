                    Hello, everyone. This is my first post here, but I've been lurking for a little bit since Rob Donoghue told me about this place a month or two ago. This place rocks, and I'm hoping to participate in the rocking. The questions I want to ask are short, but require a lot of context to set up, and I want to geek out a little about the cool PTA show I played recently.<br/>
<br/>
It's called "Mister Rodgers' Neighborhood," and it's set in the wake of the nuclear destruction of Washington DC by parties unknown in the near future. Chaos has set in across the countryside, and the failed attempt of the emergency government to restore order has exploded into full-out civil war. Large-scale communications infrastructures break down, and gradual attrition leaves many parts of the country isolated and fending for themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Against this backdrop, the show puts its focus squarely on the small town of Manassas, Virginia, as well as the efforts of a group of locals to return community to the town's remnants amidst cultural and racial divisiveness of every stripe. It's America as microcosm, right in your face. The title comes from Pastor Fred Rodgers, a local preacher with honest charisma and moral strength, who becomes sort of a focal point of the protags' hopes for the future.<br/>
<br/>
One of the protags is named Greg, and he's a construction foreman in Manassas with a little bit of a dark streak to him. His wife died in the initial outburst of violence and disease after the blast, and since then he's changed - he's sullen, willing to let the ends justify the means, willing to enact 'rough justice' without thought, and so on. He believes that Rodgers is the best thing for the town, and he's going to do whatever he can to see that Rodgers ends up in charge when all is said and done. His Issue is self-loathing, as the terrible knowledge that he's become someone his wife would hate hangs over him in the wake of her passing.<br/>
<br/>
In the episode I want to post about, Greg (Issue: 2) ends up killing a young member of a gang who showed up to vandalize Rodgers' church by throwing rocks at it during Sunday morning service. One of the rocks hits Rodgers', Greg sees red, and before he comes to his senses, he's gone outside and hit this poor kid over the head with a 2'x4', ending his life. This leads to a real escalation of tension as the gang vows revenge on Greg and "his kind," as the threat of a violence that will destroy any semblance of peace in Manassas looms large. <br/>
<br/>
The other protag, Miriam (intellectual ex-soldier, de facto leader of a group of isolationist anarcho-punks, Issue: damaged idealism, rated 1 in this episode) goes into the heart of the gang's territory to sue for peace with their leader for the sake of the town. She gets captured. Cut to a scene where Greg tries to manipulate Miriam's punks into going to rescue her en masse, an act that will most certainly escalate the meltdown into violence.<br/>
<br/>
The stakes for the conflict were framed as follows: will Greg's self-righteousness win over his conscience (as represented by visions of his dead wife in his head) and allow him to show the resolve he needs to win over Miriam's gang, or will his self-loathing and regret kick in and show through? <br/>
<br/>
We rolled (still using dice, and I matched his screen presence for the roll), he lost and got narration, and the scene played out great, leading eventually to Greg making a Faustian bargain and reluctantly joining his Nemesis (the ex-mayor of Manassas, his dead wife's dad, corrupt as all hell) at the end of the episode.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the interesting part, though: when framing the conflict, it was pretty clear that he was very invested in the one outcome (convincing the gang) and I was very invested in the other outcome. There wasn't any touchy-feely sort of synthesis where we both accepted each outcome as "equally" interesting to both of us... but that's exactly what gave the thing the tension necessary to make it an awesome experience. I mean, we both agreed to riff on whatever happened, but it was that moment of not knowing who was going to get their way that gave the conflict a little extra something, game-wise.<br/>
<br/>
However, I've read some statements on various fora, and kind of get the impression from the book, that this is bad mojo for PTA play and that everyone should be just as interested in each side of the stakes. And I'm kinda confused about that. 'Cause to me, that "I might not get what I want" tension is what keeps PTA from being just a strange meme for round-robin campfire tales. <br/>
<br/>
I'm reminded of this Vincent Baker quote: "The only worthwhile use for rules I know of is to sustain in-game conflict of interest, in the face of the overwhelming unity of interest of the players... Any rules that don't do it, you're just as well off if you ditch 'em and play freeform."<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think, and how does this usually go in your PTA games?<br/>

                            Having never played PTA before, I'd say that the difference you're asking about is almost semantic.  The key to play is that, while you may <em>want</em> one outcome to occur over another, you are <em>comfortable</em> with either of them happening.  There's nothing wrong with rooting for one side or the other; you just have to be okay with that side losing.                        </div>

                            I wish I could say I picked the town because of firsthand experience or done some research, but it was all for historical irony's sake. More than likely, our show's image of Manassas couldn't be further from the real thing. :)                        </div>

                            Sounds to me like you got it exactly right, Landon. It's totally cool that you guys were really caring about outcomes in this way.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing the PTA text stipulates is that conflicts are about what the <i>protagonist</i> wants. You did that. What the players want is a secondary layer thrown on top, and you'll see how people feel by the way Fan Mail flows and how much Budget comes out and how hard a player pushes to apply traits.<br/>
<br/>
But the fact that conflicts must always be about what the protagonist wants (and the Producer is instructed to create obstacles to protag desires) means that yes, conflicts will still be created in the face of unity of interest from the players.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah. You're spot on.                        </div>

                            The key factor in the above is that there's not an outcome that nobody finds interesting. If one possibility is "meh" for everyone, then maybe it's worth re-tooling. But all it takes is for one person to get excited by it, even if it's a negative excitement, as in "oh man that would be horrible!"                        </div>
