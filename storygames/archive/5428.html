DvG is about a mighty clash between chaos (The Dragon) and reason (The Gun). It's a cross between Polaris and Killer using D12s and a revolutionary system of nudges!<br/><br/>Fortunately I was able to grab one of the slots at the splendid Nerdinburgh ably hosted by Per. Thanks Per. The playtest gave me plenty of food for thought and there will be quite a few changes to the text coming out of it. Overall the game went really well and was a lot of fun for everyone involved.<br/><br/>As DvG is a marvellous GMless game (all the best games are these days) I acted in a facilitator role, explaining the rules and options to people.<br/>Of the four players I only knew Joe M. I've gamed with Joe several times, he is a great roleplayer but crucially honest about things he doesn't like! Calum and Jenny are in a relationship and also in Joe M's regular gaming group. We all met Pooka for the first time!<br/><br/>So as the old codgers went off to play Sorcerer and Sword us young uns and Joe settled down for a game of DvG. Pooka recorded the session, which I suspect will prove invaluable to this games designer. Though this first post is just from memory. I don't want to be biased by what was actually said. Erm anyway...<br/><br/>I kicked things off by reading out the introduction and setting from the game text. This helped get everyone on the same page as to what the game was about. We went with the default setting The Twilight Valleys of Sun and Moon.<br/><br/><b>Character Creation</b><br/>DvG has players running multiple PCs (it's so out there).  I was conscious of the time limit and had intended for just a couple of players to have  two PCs and the others to have a single PC each. However, after some discussion we decided to go for the default option of two PC's each. PC creation was entertaining and quite collaborative as the players shared ideas. I brought up Alignment early on as I was conscious of how faction balance affects the game. As such we ended up with three Dragon-Kin, three pro-Gun Slayers and two neutrals. The PCs were:<br/><br/>Player: PC [Alignment] - Primary Traits<br/><br/>Pooka: Miles [Reconciler] - Satyr. Outcast.<br/>Pooka: Zane Landisman [Slayer] - Human &amp; proud of it! Adroit.<br/><br/>Joe M: Lih [Slayer] - Riflewoman. Peasant.<br/>Joe M: Emaus [Nihilist] - Veteran (Manticore). <br/><br/>Calum: Mikhail Ranaska [Slayer] - Sense of duty.<br/>Calum: Jack 'The Squirrel' [Dragon-Kin] - Trickster. Friendly.<br/><br/>Jenny: Lyra [Dragon-Kin] - Dryad.<br/>Jenny couldn't think of a second character so she opted for a pre-gen - Lady Atemia, ruler of the Moon valley.<br/>Jenny: Lady Atemia [Dragon-Kin] - Mistress of the Wyld Hunt<br/><br/>Overall Character creation took a little longer than I'd hoped (about an hour). There is a significant amount of number crunching in the current version of the rules, no more so than most other RPGs out there but still more than I'd like. So chargen points will be revised, instead of 36 points, each PC will be built from 12 points. Factored into this I'm going to standardise Primary Traits, so that every PC gets two (as it stands now there is no mechanical advantage to having more than one Primary Trait).<br/><br/>We then moved on to deciding upon each PC's Quest goal. Some good story stuff here: Emaus wanted to have a child,  Lyra was trying to recover a stolen artifact, Mikhail and Zane both wanted to impose order on the world. An interesting point came up - can quests directly involve other PCs? Embarrassingly I forgot my own rules which clearly state they can't...Ah well. I may modify it to allow goals involving other PCs if their player explicitly agrees.<br/><br/>We briefly touched on Quarries - each PC wants another dead or removed. Quarries are not chosen until after the first round of scenes, but I wanted the players to be aware of them.<br/><br/><b>Playing The Game</b> - Prologue Scenes<br/>I quickly explained how the scene structure worked. Then Pooka kicked things off with a scene for Miles, framing the satyr lecturing some of his young acolytes. It was established that a skirmish had broken out near the border. Pooka set Miles the scene goal of stopping the fighting. I explained how bidding to introduce a conflict worked and Joe (IIRC)  weighed in -  the fighting was more severe than  originally thought and some of the acolytes were involved!  Miles used his Dragon Aspects to raise a force of woodland creatures and sang a beguiling ballad. The song did the trick and the forces disengaged.<br/><br/>Joe took the next scene, the diminutive sniper Lih opportunistically taking out forces from both Valleys, in an attempt to escalate the border conflict. However, the satyr's song still lingered, causing Lih to weep and spoil her aim. Lih failed and was given a new tertiary Trait - tears.<br/><br/>Calum took a scene next for Mikhail, the soldier had been dispatched to help the Sun forces establish a new colony - the problem was the Moon village in the way. Mikhail's goal was to eradicate the village's resistance. Pooka provided the conflict - Mikhail received a dispatch ordering him to return to the Sun valley, a military escort was required for one of the wonder-makers. This was Pooka bringing in Zane indirectly, very nice. Calum lost the conflict, Mikhail's duty compelled him to leave before he could crush the village.<br/><br/>Jen took her turn last. Lyra returned to a sacred grove to find the dryad warders slain and the the life sustaining artifact stolen. Lyra's goal was to reach the Dryad ancients to report the theft. Despite all her woodland trickery, Lyra failed and was alo drawn into the border conflict with the Sun troops.<br/><br/>After the first round of scenes I made sure that quarries were formalised, each PC chose a quarry (in secret). Though Pooka didn't realise it was in secret at first and told everyone he was going after Lady Atemia! He then changed it.<br/><br/>At this point in the game Pooka had the lead in Power Points (PPs), Joe and Calum were about equal and Jenny was lagging behind a little.<br/>We had a four story elements established, but these didn't play as big a part mechanically as I'd intended. Probably because I didn't remind people how they were used. The story elements did inform people on framing scenes and bringing in conflicts though - which is just as important.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince" title="JJ Prince"><img alt="JJ Prince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/images/minis/tinyGP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince">JJ Prince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121708/#Comment_121708" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T11:23:30+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 11:23AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The next round of scenes got more interactive, tying the characters together. Mikhail joined up with Zane and the Sun forces who had the dryads artifact the final component for his greatest invention... The Dragon-Kin launched a counter attack spearheaded by centaurs and dryads - they overcame Zane's 'beautiful killing machines' bust lost many kin. Emmaus tried to steal the artifact, an ancient egg. He failed and gained the Flaw 'Works for Zane'. The Moon Valley dispatched Luna's chosen, the werewolf elite to join the assault on the convoy. The second round of scenes built towards a climax as Lady Artemia opted to lead the attack personally. Zane and Mikhail both bought entry into the scene, giving Jen some much needed Power Points. All four players were involved in heavy fighting: Jen had Atemia attack Mikhail, Zane helped Mikhail and Emmaus joined Atemia. The advantage swung one way then another as the wolves overran the camp and the Sun forces hastily built a barricade, allowing them to fend off the wolves with steam-powered lasers! Mikhail came off the worst, taking a nasty shoulder wound from Atemia's arrow. Mikhail and Zane retreated, leaving Jenny with a significant Power Point advantage. Calum was nearly out of PPs, with Joe and Pooka not faring much better.<br/><br/>The final scene we played out was Pooka's. He placed Miles in the Spotlight and had him confront Emmaus. The two characters had a  lengthy and intense debate - Miles attack Emmaus to convince him to leave the Valleys behind. Miles succeeded and Joe opted to conserve his remaining PPs for Lih, meaning Emmaus retired from the game. This counted as a 'kill' for Miles and he revealed the manticore was his Quarry - gaining him a PP bounty!<br/><br/>Then we were out of time and Per had some tasty pizzas on the go so we left the game there. Overall I think everyone had a good time. DvG is certainly the most complex of my games to date in terms of mechanics, but even so by the end of the session the players had a lot of the nuances down and were engaging really well with the system. There were some aspects of the system that were underused and some things that I willdefinitely be changing as a result of the playtest - more on these later!<br/><br/>Cross posted with Collective-Endeavour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121817/#Comment_121817" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T23:12:55+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 11:12PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any game where you shoot werewolves with steam-powered lasers?

Well worth a listen SGers!<br/><br/>(Turn and face the stranger)  Ch-Ch-Changes. Resulting from the playtest. More to remind me than anything else but any comments are welcome \u2013 especially from the players! <br/><br/><b>Fight</b>!<br/>The massive combat we had in the penultimate scene did get a little bogged down. True, it heavily involved all the players, however I favour something slightly swifter. It became clear that the distinction between attacker and defender is contributing to this lack of pace. In the next iteration of rules, I'm going to streamline things so whoever wins the check gets to deal damage. So there will be no need for the defender to succeed then strike back becoming the attacker...<br/><br/><b>Vital Stats</b><br/>Presence and Influence are going to revert to Body and Mind, it's just simpler, helping keep the two arenas more discrete and concret. There was some discussion of merging the two stats into a single measure, but I'll avoid that for now in order to preserve the 2 conflict arenas. I'm also going to give all PCs 7 points to split between Body/Mind (6/1 5/2  4/3) to simplify character creation. Another clarification is that PC helper can only use the same stat as the PC they are helping in the conflict. <br/><br/><b>Character Creation</b><br/>As mentioned above  I'm going to reduce the number of points PCs are built from. Stats will always sum to 7. Each PC will always have 2 Primary Traits. [These equate to 26 points]. PCs then receive 12 points to distribute between further Traits and Aspects. [As opposed to 36 points in total].  <br/><br/>Character sheets will be improved to incorporate cheat sheets and nudge trackers.  <br/><br/>The distinction between Gifts and Facets also proved confusing! Best I just call em what they're used for \u2013 dice and nudges.   <br/><br/>I really like what Pooka did with his Traits, had them branching so the Primary led to the Secondary and the Secondary to the Tertiary. <br/>Zane had: 'Human and proud of it!' --&gt; 'Bigot' --&gt; 'Borderline Sociopath' <br/>I shall convey this splendid idea in the text. <br/><b><br/>Resolving Conflicts</b><br/>Aspect (Invoking Dragon/ Drawing Gun) dice and nudges are currently just folded into the total roll for the entire conflict/attack. In the next playtest I'd like Aspects to be a second stage of conflict res \u2013 allowing players to escalate to using Aspects and increasing tension.  <br/><br/>I'm keen to try using Successes as 'narrative manoeuvres' to give conflicts a bit more flow. Each Player gets to state a manoeuvre (or counter-move) with a Success. When one side is out of Successes any remaining become Facts/Damage as normal. <br/><br/><b>Other stuff</b><br/>I'm going to clarify the role of Master Players and Audience Masters. Probably folding the two into a single Master role. I'll also allow conflict controllers to narrate failure when there is no Audience Master. <br/><br/>Exiting scenes need another sentence, to confirm no Facts can be narrated when a character exits and that all characters have a chance to exit after a roll. <br/><br/>Flaws currently cost 2 Facts. I think this is unnecessary, since everything else costs 1 and Flaws don't seem significantly more powerful. <br/><br/>The central pool was not as dynamic an influence in the game as I\u2019d have liked. Some of this was down to lack of familiarity with the rules. Reintegration was under used and in some cases I missed it and failed to give out Power Points. <br/><br/>We didn\u2019t really get into quest conflicts, to be expected in such a short game, though it would have been nice to see how things went mechanically.  <br/><br/>So there you have it, plenty of writing for me to do. Overall, I\u2019m really pleased with how the game is shaping up and looking forward to playing more soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
