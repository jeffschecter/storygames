The negotiation over challenges (that is, player freedom to choose their own challenges) is unique and interesting, as it obviates the need for game balancing. The core activity of dungeoneering is socially very robust, too, which I like a lot - the game requires much less creative accord and can take a higher amount of deadwood players without bothering play. The role of the GM is much more balanced than in traditional games, as the GM is not rensponsible for pacing and framing - the game involves a degree of shared duties that would be considered radical to this day. Also, the organic resolution procedures that constantly reference the fiction in resolving issues is a perfect accompaniment to the above; many other games would break down with e.g. the merciless process that determines character death, but the way D&amp;D organizes and frames challenge makes it all work.<br/><br/>Of course, the above goes for the version of D&amp;D I've been playing. The game's textual and practical history is so wide and varied that there are not many things somebody hasn't done with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370894/#Comment_370894" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T10:10:21+00:00" title="April  3, 2012 10:10AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the moment, I can only speak to Stars Without Number.<br/><br/>I love the fragility of beginning characters. The game is saying, "most people don't lead lives of adventure, because here's why: you get killed." Surviving that is testament to being badass. In some modern hippy game you'd probably get "scar points" or something from a fight. In OSR you just know that your character has scars, and each one is a trophy.<br/><br/>I love the lack of rules minutia. For our Sunday SWN game, I need one book, and most of the time I barely need that. There's apparently a spot-ruling muscle, and it gets stronger with use.<br/><br/>I love that as a GM, I am constantly surprised by what happens. The sandbox is a wonderful thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370895/#Comment_370895" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T10:13:12+00:00" title="April  3, 2012 10:13AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am drawn to the the surreal situations that naturally arise.

How direct interaction with the rules isn't always the best solution.  Disengaging from an obvious rule can sometimes be more effective.  You can fight anything.  There are mechanics for that.  But to outsmart / overcome you often have to think outside what's presented to you in a thoughtless way.  <br/><br/>Adventurers carrying weird stuff like bags of flour or whatever because sure, you can cast Dispel Magic to stop an invisible enemy, but you can also nail them with the bag of flour, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370899/#Comment_370899" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T10:25:32+00:00" title="April  3, 2012 10:25AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because an "interact with imaginary physics to solve problems to the referee's satisfaction" game is quite a different experience than a "interact with an economy that promotes dramatic tension" game.<br/><br/>And yes, those are both incomplete and perhaps unfair characterizations.

The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle. This reliability comes at the cost of accuracy, as the looser tolerances do not allow for precision and consistency....The average service life of an AK-47 is 20 to 40 years depending on the conditions to which it has been exposed"<br/><br/>-Wikipedia                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370950/#Comment_370950" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T13:06:45+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  1:06PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am drawn to the OSR games because there's a lot of excitement around them coming from people I like to game with.<br/><br/>What can I say?

And how they are asymmetrical.<br/><br/>As a player, I like exploring someone else's setting, and focusing all my attentions on problem-solving and discovery, and just imagining being this character in this setting.<br/><br/>As a DM, I like creating a setting to reveal to the players, and being able to throw a bunch of random stuff into it that I think is neat, whether they are problems, threats, tools, or rewards, and then being surprised at how the players interact with everything.<br/><br/>These also:<br/><br/>I like the grittiness/lethality/weak-level-1, but not overwhelmingly so. I think that is just one flavour of a challenge that isn't too easy and can't be completely, unequivocally beaten.<br/><br/>I like the artifacts, too. We don't use miniatures much, but there's always maps. I like maps because they are exploration and puzzle at the same time.<br/><br/>I like that the stories attached to characters are almost entirely the stuff that happens to them during play, and not backstory, even backstory invented during play. And how these stories are often most affected by random tables and completely unexpected events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370966/#Comment_370966" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T14:07:14+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  2:07PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2012 2:33PM by Kobayashi.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of things in fact... In no particular order.<br/><br/><b>Ease of use</b> : easy to learn, easy to explain, easy to GM <br/><br/><b>Life is a bitch</b> : adventuring is dangerous and if you act foolishly you end up dead. Well, you might die if you are too cautious as well. <i>Experiment</i>.<br/><br/><b>Fast combat</b> : my OSR games of choice are <i>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</i> and <i>Sword &amp; Wizardry : White Box</i>. When combat is fast you have time for other things.<br/><br/><b>Fruitful void</b> : "<i>a character's background is what happens between level 1 and 6</i>" (IIRC). So you don't have to make up your character's background at the beginning of the game when you barely know the setting, the rules and possibly the other players. <br/><br/><b>The AK-47 analogy</b> : it's funny because I used this one on a french forum. The point is you can have a highly focused game, with very tight rules and very narrow situation or setting, something like a top-notch sniper rifle. When you hit the target, it's great but if you miss it's a disaster. With an OSR game you can have drunk players, sloppy preparation, different players with different agendas and still have fun. I like that. <br/><br/><b>The goulash</b> : you like <i>Burning Wheel's</i> Instincts ? <i>Trollbabe's</i> "free and clear" stage ? Just put them in your game. <br/><br/><b>Trust</b> : an OSR game works if the GM trust the players and vice-versa, there are no rules preventing either of them to act like dicks. That's good, I don't need rules to handle basic human relationships.<br/><br/><b>Energy</b> : there are a lot of things happening (blogs, books, whatever...) and there are many things waiting to be done. I love to read OSR blogs with a smile on my face and find things that I'll immediatly use in my games.<br/><br/><b>Fruitful void II</b> : the cracks in the game (or "<i>missing rules</i>") is where the game happen, between the GM and the players. The less cracks you have, the less space the GM and players have.<br/><br/><b>Failure</b> : sometimes your character fails and there is no "<i>Yes, but...</i>" or "<i>No, but...</i>". Sometimes "<i>No</i>" is the only answer and you have to find something else to do. This is what failure is all about. And OSR games are all about learning from your failures (as a player <i>and</i> as a GM).<br/><br/><b>Space-time anomaly</b> : as Snake Eyes said above, I can create a character in 5 minutes and play him for one hour or 3 years. The rules won't break either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370970/#Comment_370970" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T14:19:49+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  2:19PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The worst thing about old-school role playing games is that they never quite told you how to play 'em.<br/>They took for granted some kinda shared mindset that musta been happening in Lake Geneva... or something?<br/>Maybe?

You don't get second-order effects creeping out of the woodwork to surprise the players and interrupt the flow of play. It's a side-effect of their extreme orthogonality- because there are so many self-contained systems, they don't bleed over into each other in the way of a game with a unified resolution mechanism. With some more modern games you end up with 12-die synergies leaping out of nowhere because the game's mechanical vocabulary can only express challenges along one axis of resolution. These individual systems can often actually be easier to remember and use than permutations of a unified mechanism, simply because the very distinct systems have less risk of confusion than several remixed implementations of the same mechanism.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the table, I love the ease of play. People don't get overwhelmed by old-school D&amp;D. Even at AD&amp;D's most baroque, your character fits on a 3x5 card and the DM will tell you if you need to roll anything more exotic than a hit roll or a saving throw. If you're playing OD&amp;D or B/X, you can learn every rule a player will ever need to remember in ten minutes- five if you're an experienced RPGer- and have your first character rolled up during the process. That sense of ease and system mastery lets players stop worrying about whether they're playing the game correctly and focus instead on the events of the game and what sort of actions and goals they intend to pursue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are plenty of legitimate objections as to whether or not old-school games are the best tool for any particular purpose. More modern games have done really impressive things in modeling genres, engineering specific experiences, and interrogating the meta-context around the game-as-experienced. But old-school gaming is beautifully adapted for just sitting down, grabbing a character, and taking them as far in whatever direction you choose as your luck and personal cunning can carry them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370994/#Comment_370994" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T15:23:21+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  3:23PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2012 3:24PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ross, I dig grit and heroic journeys too.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about OS play, when it's done fiction-first instead of rules-first, is how the world becomes vivid through intense attention born of huge incentives.  Basically, anything in this room could be the key to my character's death, survival, or profit, so my character is really tuned in to his surroundings, and now I as a player am too.  This remains the classic version of immersion for me.  I may be using a funny voice or whatever, but that's me, here in this imaginary place, trying to figure out the best way forward.<br/><br/>I'm not talking about the GM hiding clues and setting traps for the inattentive, I'm talking about treating every fictional detail as real, and honoring what it is and what it can do in the hands of the inventive.<br/><br/>I'm talking about the GM who stays impartial, and reasons from within the world, allowing the players' growing knowledge of that world to become their most powerful tool.

Like, <i>Stars Without Number</i> and <i>Adventurer Conqueror King</i> are the games that I thought Traveller and D&amp;D were, but then when I read them they felt really incomplete.<br/><br/>What I like about the old school itself is the character fragility and emergent protagonism that Matt talks about upthread. It introduces a kind of tension and anxiety to the game that I haven't had in a game in a long time. While I remember feeling a sense of relief when encountering <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> and <i>Trollbabe</i> and all these games where I didn't have to about my character casually dying, I threw the baby out with the bathwater. And it's really satisfying to feel that character go from a person who a stray bullet could kill to someone who can dive into a firefight and still be at risk, but be a serious badass before they go down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371073/#Comment_371073" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T22:59:20+00:00" title="April  3, 2012 10:59PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I like about the OSR specifically is that it's keeping alive a tradition of play that I've never experienced, and making it increasingly likely that I will experience it a la what Johnzo said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>I am drawn to the OSR games because there's a lot of excitement around them coming from people I like to game with.<br/><br/>What can I say?

We played most weekends, to pass the time on long distance car trips, at lunchtime in the school library. Nowdays, I can talk about roleplaying with a wonderful array of folks from all over the world, and its amazing! But my brothers (who have stopped gaming mostly) and I still break out my well-worn and much beloved B/X D&amp;D most Holidays when we get together, and once or twice a year share a magical experience that catapults us back, to interact with our child selves and roll up some characters, pulling on familiar roles of caller and mapper and DM like a super-comfy pair of jeans and jumper. Despite trying them on other, newer and more 'indie' rulesets, the lads always want to go back to <b>our<i></i></b> jointly developed version of D&amp;D.

I got the basic set when I was seven, and a blue and white map of a dungeon is enough to make me go all misty-eyed.  Sigil of wistful adventure.<br/><br/>Pre-planned dungeons are also a really good way of exploring someone else's imagination.  In games where the content emerges on the fly, it's much more about what those of us sitting around the table can come up with.  If the game is about exploration, then it's five people exploring the GM's imagination, so pre-written content greatly increases the diversity of ideas.<br/><br/>The other thing is that a pre-planned dungeon has a certain concreteness to it.  When I play story games, reality feels spongy - I guess I'm keenly aware of how I'm willing, as GM, to bend heaven and earth to make a narratively satisfying outcome.  A pre-planned dungeon is unyielding in this regard, and therefore much more narratively dangerous.  There's no chance of you finding a secret door that bypasses the danger, there isn't one here.  The deadliness of this or that trap doesn't respect your remaining hit points so we can explore what your character goes through mentally as he or she crawls home, half crippled - you just get crushed by the stone block.  It creates a very different attitude toward risk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371210/#Comment_371210" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T12:33:46+00:00" title="April  4, 2012 12:33PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ross Cowman</cite>I want to invite everyone to add this for consideration...<br/><br/><b>Some hallmark OSR mechanics:</b><br/>-Hit Points<br/>-The 6 stats<br/>-3d6 Stats that translate into modifiers<br/>-Armor Class<br/>-Missing<br/>-the d20<br/>-Attack and Damage Rolls<br/>-Skills<br/>-Equipment<br/>-Experience Points<br/>-Leveling<br/>Adding skills + equipment + fictional positioning to calculate the odds of success?<br/><br/><b>A question:</b><br/>how do these mechanics, create the experiences we've been talking about above?<br/><br/>Posters: please focus on mechanics you like.</blockquote>\nI think that list is more mutable than you think.

I mean come on, how many of you were alive in 1977?</blockquote>\nThe Old School Renaissance (OSR) is pretty heavily focused on D&amp;D, partly because of the d20 OGL content that made a lot of the retro-cloning possible. Other RPGs of the era come up (James Maliszewski talks about <i>Traveller</i> all the time), but none of them benefit from being open content, ergo, there's no big DIY publishing effort re-invigorating those games, with a few exceptions (like the Tekumel Foundation). Ergo, less passionate discussion and product-creation.<br/><br/>In addition, classic Traveller never really went away, I think, as the reprints have been available for a long time now; long before the OSR started.<br/><br/>That, and Mark Miller is still alive. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Stars Without Number took a significant leaf from Traveller, in its skill system and sandbox-cosmos framing. I think Traveller certainly belongs to the era that inspired the OSR, but as was mentioned upthread, Traveller's current situation doesn't lend itself to the kind of dive-in-and-produce enthusiasm that early-era D&amp;D does. Traveller is very much a live intellectual property in a way that OD&amp;D isn't. It also has a thick accretion of canon and world-building around it, and a lot of Traveller's most enthusiastic fans feel absolutely no need to deviate drastically from it. There's no retroclone of Traveller available or needed, and when you get down to it there are a whole lot fewer Traveller grognards than there are D&amp;D old-timers. If only one in a thousand former players decides to put out some old-school stuff, simple math is going to ensure that the vast majority of it will be D&amp;D-derived.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not to say that 1977 Traveller isn't an old-school gem in its own right. Character generation is fast, the game is set up explicitly to provide the kind of sandbox experience that many OSR fiends like myself love so much, and the imperial-SF tech level is pitch-perfect for empowering the PCs with nifty gear without handing them posthuman toys that mere mortal GMs have a hard time processing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371368/#Comment_371368" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T06:56:08+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  6:56AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SineNomine</cite>Character generation is fast...</blockquote>Yeah... sometimes so much that your character dies during it. :P<br/><br/>I always thought that was dumb.

In the large numbers you get at higher levels they balance out the early-level mortality of the system and give a guarantee your Level 10 guy will not be killed by a kobold's arrow. Although many people like old D&amp;D; because of its "hardcore" nature, there is a spectrum of solutions developed in the first ten years of the hobby, with many rather early editions (1st and 2nd AD&amp;D;) having workarounds like bleeding from negative hit points or maximum HP at first level, and many non-AD&amp;D; old school games like Runequest or Warhammer FRP having a more uniformly lethal combat system.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">-The 6 stats</div>\n</blockquote>\nThe 6 stats are fairly arbitrary; Melee/Wizard and GURPS boiled them down to 3 and "improving" them by making them more specific and accurate is almost a required feature of every "fantasy heartbreaker" game. Looked at within-game rather than as some sort of personnel capability system, though, four of them relate to the four basic classes, one is for general survivability, and one is for the social interactions that many old-school approaches emphasize (henchmen, negotiation with monsters).<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">-3d6 Stats that translate into modifiers</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe modifiers are one simple way to have the stats mean something without completely dominating the player's choices. A fairly "weak" stat-modifier mapping (e.g., in Matt Finch's Swords and Wizardry, where a score of 15+ gives +1) has been defended on the grounds that Old School play is more freeform and granular, depending more on what the player does than who the character is. 3d6 is a classic bell curve, rolling stats in order means there is no agonizing min-maxing at character creation, having the possibility of low as well as high stats is an integral part of Old School grit.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">-Armor Class<br/>\n-Missing<br/>\n-Attack and Damage Rolls</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe to-hit/AC system, as everyone eventually discovers, is not great in terms of realism. But it's simple, requiring fewer calculations than say, Runequest's attack-defend-location-damage-compare to armor. I won't say this is tops on my list of essential elements. Also, clinging to descending AC is kind of a litmus test for irrational traditionalism in the movement, although it doesn't bother me that much.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">-the d20</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nIt's a nice compromise in granularity. 1/100 results almost never come up, and d% systems tend to be mathy. 1/10 or 1/6 come up too often. In a given D&amp;D; fight the d20 gets rolled maybe 20 times, so there's a good chance that you'll see every result, but 1/20 is rare enough for houserul3es like crits and fumbles.<br/>\n.\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">-Skills</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nActually, old school gaming is more about the absence or radical simplification of skills. A purist going by Matt Finch's Primer would have you verbally detail  every trap search and ninja leap rather than rolling against some skill, and the ability scores do yeoman duty. Castles and Crusades has a very neat system that uses abilities and levels as the backbone of skill resolution. I personally think "player-skilling" every little thing is unworkable and as a DM I compromise, letting important, simple or unusual acts hinge on player descriptions, but using a simple skill system when unsure.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">-Equipment</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nMules in the dungeon, chickens as trap detectors, ten foot poles, iron spikes, flaming oil. Equipment, used in less than heroic ways, is one way that paper-thin first level characters can even the odds against a nasty-non-level-balanced old-school dungeon.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">-Experience Points</div>\n</blockquote>\nThis is one where you see great variety in Old School practice, from session-based leveling up to treasure-rewarding systems to combat-rewarding systems. When it works right, an experience system gives the players the chance to revel in great rewards taken at great risk.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">-Leveling</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThis is part of the simplicity of the system, that lets you come up with an NPC on the fly rather than calculating all her feats and abilities idiosyncratically. It also means players worry less about optimizing their character with a custom set of skills and more about characterizing their character in play.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Adding skills + equipment + fictional positioning to calculate the odds of success?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThis is part of the physical simulation of the adventure environment that I consider a part of Old School gaming. I know many, perhaps most, Old School gamers eschew miniatures (reflexive backlash from 3rd and 4th ed maybe) but I find they make combats more objective and compelling, even when fighting an army of skeletons compoased mainly of plastic pawns.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll close by saying the mechanics help, but do not by themselves create the enjoyable Old School experience. They are like a skeleton that has to be fleshed out by the good will and inventiveness of DM and players. Played without guidance, as we played in high school in the 80's, these rules lead to an insipid and often frustrating hack 'n' slash experience clearing out monster motels. For over 20 years now that kind of play has been much better simulated on computers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/todd" title="todd"><img alt="todd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/todd">todd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371533/#Comment_371533" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-06T06:15:33+00:00" title="April  6, 2012  6:15AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>One difference I see is that the d20 SRD put a LOT of D&amp;D IP into the public domain, e.g., spell names, item names, monster names and common D&amp;D terminology.

It's interesting looking back and seeing how unimportant some things are that seemed big at the time and how important some of the simple things that we never bothered with can be, like Luke's recent posts about mapping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16257/osr-what-do-we-like-about-old-school" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16257/osr-what-do-we-like-about-old-school" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16257/osr-what-do-we-like-about-old-school/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16257%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16257%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
