One is the "creativity game for fantasy artists".  This is a set of lists that you roll dice against to get a bunch of different animals, vegatables, elements and technology.  Then you pick from the list your rolled and define a major form, a minor form and a surface.  So you might end up choosing a major form of a caterpiller, a minor form of scissors and a surface of a zebra.  It's an interesting (though not new) way of breaking creative blocks.  To me, the game part provided is not that interesting.  You could do the same yourself (probably better) by making lists based on scientific classification or something similar.  <br/><br/>The other part are the demonstrations Chuck Lukacs does of individual components of the lists and mixing them together.  I think his pencil work is fantastic.  He shows a very sculptural style that shows the building of the creatures and objects quite well.  For most of the drawings he shows step by step from initial sketch to finished art, which helps you get a feel for the architecture of the anatomy of the different creatures.<br/><br/>So, I would recommend this book if you like the work of Lukacs and want to get a better feel for how he constructs his drawings.  I do not recommend this for the "game" part of it, which I've already said would be extremely easy to do yourself.<br/><br/>What I find interesting is the methods that artists and writers are going to in order to break free of creativity blocks.  Recently a number of digital artists have praised the program <a href="http://al.chemy.org/" rel="nofollow">Alkemy</a> for it's use of random imaging to create new silhouettes previously not thought of.  It's nothing new, and people have been sketching upside down and blind (not looking at the paper) to get unique ideas on paper.  We've seen some of the same in game design with the Game Chef competition where some very unique and sometimes interesting games come out of a random selection of "ingredients".  Fiasco uses random lists to come up with an interesting start point for a story.<br/><br/>I'm curious what other thoughts there are to breaking free of some of the creative blocks we have in game design and art.  I think sometimes we get too entrenched in the ruts of genre or history to break free.  Things that work well continue to work well, and I don't believe we need to break things just to break them.  However, how can we know what else is out there unless we experiment?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273017/#Comment_273017" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T14:30:43+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  2:30PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting topic.<br/><br/>I think a lot of games published in the last five years have been tackling that head-on: creativity brought about by constraints coupled with random input.<br/><br/>In a way, I'm surprised more major artists don't rely on such techniques to produce their art--whether painters, designers, authors...<br/><br/>When I mentioned some of my story game designs to a few fiction writers and script writers, they were totally fascinated (and surprised!). I wonder if there's not much like that out there, outside the gaming community?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273302/#Comment_273302" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T09:42:39+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  9:42AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a number of ideation techniques that we go over in my product design program. There's a couple published things out there that are basically decks of cards with questions/prompts on them (like "Something that floats" "Something thats smooth" etc) but it's probably easy enough to make your own list and roll some dice to pick randomly!<br/><br/>Some things that I find useful for me:<br/><br/>- Going to Wikipedia and clicking "Random Article" and pulling useful elements<br/>- "Impossible" thinking - like "what if this cup has no bottom". This would be akin to saying "This game uses a dice mechanic but you're not allowed to roll the dice ever," or something like that. Set up two opposed restrictions and poke at it.<br/>- Similar to that, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_(lateral_thinking)" rel="nofollow">Po, aka Provocative Operation</a>. <br/>- Mood boards/collage (assembling a ton of images from all over the place)<br/><br/>For game design, I'm often working on games that have a strong attachment to real-world stuff, like history or a specific kind of literature. I'll make notes on little elements from my "research" and try to incorporate them into the game, rather than looking for "gameable" stuff in the research. I get a lot of good ideas that way that I would never have come up with on my own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273304/#Comment_273304" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T09:56:58+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  9:56AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great topic Erik!<br/>\n<br/>\nGM wise, I scan through:<br/>\n<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.nytimes.com/gst/mostpopular.html" rel="nofollow">NY Times most popular lists (emailed, blogged, searched)</a><br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books" rel="nofollow">Amazon's bestsellers list</a><br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/" rel="nofollow">Flickr's interesting photos from the last 7 days</a><br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://news.yahoo.com/photos/gallery/1756" rel="nofollow">Yahoo's most emailed photos</a><br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://news.yahoo.com/io/964" rel="nofollow">Yahoo's most popular news</a><br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends" rel="nofollow">Google trends</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273309/#Comment_273309" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T10:18:14+00:00" title="May 27, 2010 10:18AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are all cool tools.<br><br>I have a box full of note cards with ideas, some are items, some are characters (increasingly, more and more are characters), some are scenes from things I liked, whenever I see something I like I throw it in there.<br><br>Or, I go and read a nice thick novel that's in the public domain on Google Books.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273405/#Comment_273405" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T05:31:36+00:00" title="May 28, 2010  5:31AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of Emily Care Boss's games do very interesting things to break the blank-page problem: mad libs, word webs, slips of paper that tell you how to describe things, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
