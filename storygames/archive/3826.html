But that's assuming you've scheduled an event. Which is to say that I think that everyone will agree that having a scheduled event over-run another scheduled event is awful. But if you don't schedule events, then that's a lot less problematic, no? <br/>\n<br/>\nI can't imagine scheduling events for a 12 player convention. That's two or three - maybe four - concurrently running games. At that rate you can probably just communicate from "table" to "table" to figure out who wants to do what for how long. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, if the players all agree that they'd like to play longer in a scheduled event, then why not? The issue is forcing a player to have to choose between half an hour of this cool game right now, and losing out on the potential fun of the next four hour slot (which they may miss entirely if they can't show up on time for it). As long as that's not an issue, then no problem usually. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo whit, when starting the session ask everyone if they have a session that follows in the next time slot, or generally how long they're willing to play. And then push to meet those deadlines. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not an easy skill, but it's important to learn enough pacing to ensure that you can fit the game into RL time constraints. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85966/#Comment_85966" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T16:06:46+00:00" title="August  6, 2007  4:06PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            End on time, so I can get to my next game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86012/#Comment_86012" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T00:52:48+00:00" title="August  7, 2007 12:52AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to make my own feelings clear: I think that groups who overrun should be lined up and shot.<br/><br/>This applies also to 12-person mini-conventions: where it's <i>easier</i> to overrun, because you take advantage of the fact that everyone's friends, but you <i>still</i> make me wait to start my game.<br/><br/>And I think time management is an essential GM skill.
