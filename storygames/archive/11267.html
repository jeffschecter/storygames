So it could be a mix of cooperative-antagonistic behaviour \xe0 la Highlander or House of the Blooded.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250221/#Comment_250221" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-10T11:50:26+00:00" title="January 10, 2010 11:50AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This has been speculated upon at the Forge a couple of times - to my knowledge nothing too elaborate has come up so far. My own impression is that this might be because ultimately you're going to have to choose whether you're going to respect the essentially wargamey setup of Diplomacy, or your own creative aspirations as a roleplayer. It'd be interesting to see the two harmonized, certainly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
