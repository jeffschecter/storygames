It started out on the Game Chef forums but we're bringing it here and I'm going to settle his hash once and for all.<br/><br/>Remi's Game Chef entry, Young Adult RPG, is built to emulate Daniel Pinkwater novels.  One feature of the game is that characters grow in a very regimented way - they exist in three sequential states, and their relationships to one another change in clearly defined ways.  For example, the Bully starts out much like Graham in real life, but by the end of the game explicitly rejects violence and is a changed kid.  Graham says:<br/><i><br/>Why can't the player decide how he grows: perhaps he channels his violence or uses it for good? The New Kidalways makes friends by the end. Why can't he learn to enjoy the way he's different and independent? ... I don't like this for various reasons. Firstly, it impacts replayability. Secondly, it means I can't decide things for my own character. Thirdly, it gets close to imposing a plot.</i><br/><br/>And I issue a savage rebuke:<br/><br/><i>Hey Graham, knowing the ultimate disposition of the characters isn't an impediment to gripping fiction, is it? It becomes a question of how the Bully comes 'round, just like it's a question of how The Roach ruins Pemberton. I don't see that as problematic at all.</i><br/><br/>Oh, snap!  Anyway, there's more conversation in the thread I link to, including the requisite improv example and some John Ford name-dropping, but I think we're approaching the issue from remarkably divergent viewpoints for two guys who like the same kind of games.  I'd like to talk about this more, particularly since there seems to be a disconnect between our thinking.  Maybe more voices will help us find common ground!  That usually works well, doesn't it?  <br/><br/>Conversation starter:  Does it help or hurt my case that D&amp;D does pretty much the same thing that Remi does in Young Adult RPG?  Character growth is regimented sequentially, and you enter specific, pre-defined states, right?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63999/#Comment_63999" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T05:15:24+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  5:15AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, in what way does D&amp;D regiment growth sequentially, entering specific, pre-defined states?

But (not knowing very much about Remi's game besides what you've said) it sounds like what's regimentalized is character motivation and outlook, which (agreeing with Fred here) is a bigger deal.<br/><br/>Like, you know a 5th-level monk can kick the ass of a couple of goblins - I guess that's a "state". But that's pretty different than if the rulebook said "When a monk becomes 5th level he renounces violence and seeks other ways of solving conflicts. When he reaches 7th level, he devotes himself to increasing the honor of his family. When he reaches 10th level, he retires from adventuring to take on students as a master".  See?<br/><br/>I'm with Graham that it sets the ultimate disposition of characters, but I totally agree with your rebuke that it doesn't mean there can't be gripping fiction, it only means that the gripping fiction is a variant of one set core story - the redemption of the bully.  I think you should leave D&amp;D out of it - I don't think level as character state is the same as the character states you're talking about. Bringing it into your interknife-fight will only complicate, not clarify.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64007/#Comment_64007" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T06:47:53+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  6:47AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, forget the D&amp;D comment, I can see that it wasn't accurate.

You must be mad!" means something very different when spoken by a first level rogue and a twentieth, and says something different about each one.

And that's been a part of stories and storytelling a really long time. One serious issue I have with a lot of comic book games, for example, is they don't get endings right, they just rely on skill and luck to get to one of several highly distinct sweet spots that is actually fairly hard to hit even when you're just writing.

On the other hand, I think that allowing the player a fairly free hand in determing how the narrative develops to allow that 'growth' could be fairly empowering. As I decided when designing my Game Chef entry (which always ends with the character's dying) that knowing where you end up can drive a very different but no less poignant story.<br/><br/>Also, such regimented growth is certainly a valid way to approach story or genre emulation. Essentially you are ensuring that no matter what happens in the game that the overall 'feel' or 'ending' would be appropriate to a story written by that author. Personally I think that "mandating" and regimenting the growth is a little heavy handed and I would rather see the system provide incentives rather than laws, but that is just me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64020/#Comment_64020" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T08:52:58+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  8:52AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay.  I'm failing to see the problem, I guess.  If the design goal of the game is to emulate a specific set/type of novel and these novels always have character development run a certain way, then I'm not sure why regimenting the character development of the RPG in the same manner would be bad.  Some folks might not like that kind of game but some folks don't like that kind of novel either.<br/><br/>Graham asks some valid questions, "Why can't the player decide how he grows: perhaps he channels his violence or uses it for good? The New Kid always makes friends by the end. Why can't he learn to enjoy the way he's different and independent?"  The answer seems easy enough.  The designer is trying to emulate something in which making those decisions isn't an option and isn't the point.  Graham doesn't like this.  Fine.  It still doesn't mean the game is broken or anything.  Just that he doesn't like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64026/#Comment_64026" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T09:22:26+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  9:22AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2007 9:29AM by Graham.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gaerik, it's a bit more than that. I think that prescribed story arcs take the fun out of roleplaying.<br/><br/>The one thing that RPGs do really well is let us tell a character's story. We tell it, moment by moment, making decisions along the way. If you tell me, before the game, that my character will renounce violence and embrace peace, you've taken away a very fun decision. (What if I don't? What if I <i>go evil</i>?)<br/><br/>Oh, I have a parallel argument: characters with story arcs are less fun. Contenders is fun because we don't know, until the end, whether the boxer will achieve his dreams or not. Every fight is exciting, because you can see those dreams receding or approaching. A character who follows an arc is duller, because you can see where he's going; a character who might change either way is more interesting.<br/><br/>Let's deal with those examples. <br/><br/>The progression in D&amp;D describes how the character's <i>effectiveness</i> changes. It doesn't make decisions about the character's <i>personality</i>. If it did, it'd be crap. If you tell me "You're going to become an evil mage and scourge the world", it's kinda cool, but I'd rather decide for myself.<br/><br/>The Roach analogy doesn't work, either. It's OK to constrict some bits of the <i>plot</i>. But not how the character develops.<br/><br/>It's been a pleasure talking to you, Jason. It's OK that you were wrong. I'll await an apology.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64032/#Comment_64032" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T09:36:34+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  9:36AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>I happen to hold to your preferences here.  I think having my character's end state developmentally would decrease the fun I had out of the game.  However, if the goal of the game isn't to give that kind of decision making power to the player but instead to emulate a style of fiction where certain character decisions would never be made, then that kind of restriction seems to me to be logical.  The game might not be trying to do what Contenders, D&amp;D, The Roach or any of the afforementioned games do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64036/#Comment_64036" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T09:41:57+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  9:41AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Delightful as always.  Apparently there are few, if any, games that approach this level of determinism.  Graham, I see you viewing this as a departure from (known, successful) practice, but I know it isn't the disaster you're making it out to be.  Some of this may be play style (I'd be pretty happy to be told that by session six I was going to be the evil mage ruling Greyhawk).  <br/><br/>Is this an issue of ownership?  I'm having a hard time reconciling the idea that a pre-determined outcome for the situation (The Roach) or a pre-determined outcome for an aspect of characters (D&amp;D) is substantially different from pre-determining the outcome of a character's individual story (YARPG).  It's just a piece of the game, one that is rarely tampered with, traditionally being the sacrosanct domain of an individual player.  <br/><br/>It's OK that new ideas scare you, Graham.

Brennan, yes, I'd have no problem with a slide from naivete to corruption.<br/><br/>Can I throw something out there? Let's imagine two games. First one:\n<blockquote><b>Graham's Awesome Game</b><br/><br/>In Graham's awesome game, you play a character. At some point during the game, you must renounce violence! You decide when and how. Once you do, you become more powerful!</blockquote>\nNow, I think that's great, even though the game prescribes a choice for my character. <br/><br/>Second game:\n<blockquote><b>Jason's Sucky Game</b><br/><br/>In Jason's Sucky Game, you play a school bully. After your first conflict, you realise you love violence! Your second conflict must show this love of violence!  But after your second conflict, you start to worry about violence.  In your third violence, you still enjoy violence, but you decide you have to give it up. From then on, you mustn't initiate a fight. After your fourth conflict, you become a pacifist. Now you must run away from every fight.</blockquote>\nThis game sucks, because I'm thinking: why don't you just play the game for me?<br/><br/>So why does my game RULE and Jason's SUCK? Obviously, it's partly because Jason's Sucky Game is more prescriptive.<br/><br/>But it's not just that. The thing I like about my game, which ROCKS, is that I can still decide to have my character flip out and punch someone, at any time, as long as I renounce violence before or after it. In Jason's game, past a certain point, I can't have my character flip out.<br/><br/>That's because my game has one discrete change in the character. For me, that's fun: it's a cool change but it doesn't prescribe the course of the whole game. Jason's game is more of a continuum: at any point, I know exactly how my character should be, and that takes the decision away from me.<br/><br/>Does that make any sense? The game making decisions about my character is fine, because it leaves me room to make other decisions: but tying me to a character arc isn't okay, because that restricts me.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64061/#Comment_64061" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T12:44:24+00:00" title="April 16, 2007 12:44PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um...no, actually, I don't see a real distinction between the two games.

But<br/>the reward would be different depending which option was chosen.<br/><br/>That's a nice, solid hippie mechanic; like Keys in TSOY.<br/><br/><br/>I, on the other hand, envisioned a mechanical decision-maker; rather than a reward-offerer.<br/>Player1 would consult the mechanic to see whether the way Character1 presented themselves would prevail/<br/>or whether the opposing Character2's impression of Character1 would overpower &amp; 'win'.<br/><br/>The system would <span style="text-decoration: underline;">determine</span> the outcome, rather than letting any player choose (and then impose consequences<br/>to that free choice.)<br/><br/>Vaxalon's idea hardly needs defending. Any number of recent games work that way, and function well.<br/><br/>Whereas my idea feels out of fashion.<br/><br/>I would like to believe the axiom that "players will tolerate unwanted things happening to their characters,<br/>as long as they feel those outcomes were arrived-at fairly; not personally directed at them."<br/><br/>But I don't know whether that applies to filthy hippies.

For example:\n<blockquote><cite>Essay Excerpt</cite>So, uber-characters who always succeed and always look cool while doing so. That is what much of narrativist gaming really seems to be about. It's about control and about winning, this is why in many narrativist games a good roll passes control to the player and a bad roll to the GM. Control is key, control of how cool your guy is and how badass he is. Getting control is good, and allows your guy to suddenly be incredibly cool again. Losing control is bad, a failed roll means the GM decides what happens - you don't have total control over the game anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Call Me Curly</cite>4.

Contenders is fun because we don't know, until the end, whether the boxer will achieve his dreams or not. Every fight is exciting, because you can see those dreams receding or approaching. A character who follows an arc is duller, because you can see where he's going; a character who might change either way is more interesting.</blockquote>\nGraham,<br/>I can say from experience that knowing how your character is going to end up in Contenders is no less fun. After our first Durham 3 session, my character was screwed. No way could I catch up and have a happy ending. So I played to the dark end of the character, making him more and more bestial as the game went along. It was awesome, with only one minor trip-up, where I had to fight my brother, whom I had made up with earlier in the session.<br/><br/>Also, I'd like to make clear that the character growth in YARPG _is_ an incentive to play in a certain way. Getting to the final step of Bully does not rob you of the ability to punch people, it encourages using your physical abilities to non-violent ends, and gives you a bonus for that instead of for violence. It may be a little heavy-handed, but I disagree that giving someone a general pattern for their character would necessarily impact play negatively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64160/#Comment_64160" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T10:05:01+00:00" title="April 17, 2007 10:05AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To throw my two cents worth in, I'm not at all bothered by Jason's Sucky Game, because I often don't care about what happens to a character.

If you read a book wich is written as a flashback and the first scene is chronologically the last one, it doesn't mean, you know the end of the story, because it is not the end, but the beginning of the story. The really important thing is, what will be decided later on.<br/><br/>JMS told (master of flashforwards in Babylon 5) that the important thing is not what happens, but how and why. They tell you in the first season that G'Kar and Londo will die by each others hands. But you have to wait five years until you see that it's not what is seems to be.<br/><br/>But I dare to say more: if there is no character arc in an RPG, then there will be no arc at all. The character will stagnate and nothing will happen. Why would anything happen? What would make the player change the character's alignment, behavior, attitude etc.? It becomes like a soap oper, everytime the same character and at the end of every adventure, everything is alright again. Because there is no mechanic that would make the character change.<br/><br/>Similar mechanic - maybe there is one in Kult. You have to decide wether you walk the path of mental balance or imbalance to get to see the truth at the end. Of course that means you have to change the personality of your character to achieve that. The defunct remnants of it are visible in Vampire.<br/><br/>Gabor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
