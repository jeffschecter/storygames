I played with my brother, Brad, and my two cousins John and Robert. In the session that I remember I think I was just playing with Robert, the youngest of the four of the us. I can't remember our ages exactly, I might have been 12 or 13 or so and maybe Robert was 10 or 11? John was temperamental and a troublemaker so he might have either been sitting out as a result of a tantrum or being grounded, and I think my brother was away at a wrestling tournament.<br/><br/>It's funny to look back and think that my early instincts were pretty good. I generally wanted him to succeed and have fun and have his character be the badass he wanted him to be. The Bughunters book had a bunch of different recommended kinds of adventures, and one was dealing with criminals and rebels and human antagonists. So we had a simple story about a corrupt CEO, I don't think I ever gave any information about his crimes exactly, just "he's a bad guy, get'em!" Robert was playing an infantryman and by himself shot his way through the corporate office to the top floor where the CEO was like "WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?!" and then Robert's character jump-kicked him out the window of the top floor of the building.<br/><br/>I'm cracking up as I'm writing this. It was so good. At some point later I started reading RPGs that told me that players had to EARN their awesome moments and got the really stupid idea that my job as the GM was to sit back and wait for them to do something stupid so I could smack their hands with a ruler. But those early games were all about setting up moments we could high five each other over.\ufeff                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436669/#Comment_436669" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-07T19:30:18+00:00" title="August  7, 2014  7:30PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            High five!<br/><br/>My own early roleplaying experiences were much like this, too.

They were actually pretty simple. It was usually just a straightforward "fight the bad guy" kind of plot, and things like jump kicking the CEO out a window... those were they days of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone action movies so we were emulating a lot of that.<br/><br/>I've had way more gonzo games with 30 year olds than I did when I was a kid!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436712/#Comment_436712" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T10:16:20+00:00" title="August  8, 2014 10:16AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with that, too, actually.<br/><br/>But we had a lot of wild epic fantasy stuff, like characters getting +12 swords of power and riding ancient dragons.<br/><br/>I set up our gaming group so the GM seat would rotate (although we all kept the same characters and "campaign" going), and every GM wanted to give something cool to their own character, but the only way that was acceptable was if you gave something to everyone. So, in essence, we were all competing for how "cool" the rewards we gave out were, and it got out of hand pretty fast.<br/><br/>We had to "reboot" the entire campaign pretty soon simply because it got silly, and toned it down a lot from there. That was my first ever D&amp;D game (and first roleplaying experience).<br/><br/>In retrospect, the "take turns GMing", but with the same characters, was kind of unusual. I don't think I've actually ever done that since! (Unless IaWA counts!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
