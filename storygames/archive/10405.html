Got in touch with Rob, and he got me a copy of the newest edit so I could run it for my group.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple weeks later our schedules finally normalized a bit and we had our first session last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the Authority we came up with:<br/>\n<br/>\nName: BTL, Inc (short for Better-than-Life)<br/>\nDescription: Big technology company that produces all manner of software and hardware designed to make peoples' lives better, which of course makes them more complacent.<br/>\n<br/>\nVice: Utopianism<br/>\nVisage: Corporate<br/>\nVictim: Freedom<br/>\nNeed: Complete market control.<br/>\n<br/>\nSystems of Control:<br/>\n1. BTL's technology works so well at improving peoples' lives users of their products immediately start becoming more complacent.<br/>\n2. Because the world is so connected there's a lot of pressure for people to isolate themselves and communicate solely through technological means (and of course the preferred means are all from BTL)<br/>\n3. BTL needs money to keep making their stuff and it doesn't come cheap. Because of that those too poor are kept out of site lest the more well-to-do start asking questions.<br/>\n4. Any technology that is going to be distributed to the public has to be sanctioned by an entity that's actually separate from BTL, but their fingers are in so deep, it may as well not be. Non-sanctioned technology is illegal.<br/>\n<br/>\nExploit:<br/>\n1. Thanks to bureaucratic policies and the sheer amount of information that flows into the company, it's quite often possible to go (nearly) undetected by their systems. An alarm may get tripped, but it's just as likely to get buried in the shuffle and missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nRating:<br/>\nWe didn't pick a hard and fast rating, but the only guideline we're going with is that swearing should have a purpose, not just "fuck" this and "fuck" that for the sake of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nClique:<br/>\nThe YOs are all in a poor sector and work together and a small technology company, "The Data Mine".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe YOs:<br/>\nCharacter concept: Junkie hacker<br/>\nName: Jakey? (I can't read his hand writing)<br/>\nSex: M<br/>\nAge: 15<br/>\nLooks: Rail thin, red eyes, greasy hair<br/>\nMeans: Smart<br/>\nMotive: Thrills<br/>\nOpportunity: Orphan<br/>\nM.O.: Hacker<br/>\nDisorder: I'm so good on drugs<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter concept: Fallen (from higher socity) pusher (technology)<br/>\nName: Victor<br/>\nSex: M<br/>\nAge: 16<br/>\nLooks: chubby, blond soul patch (ode to Teal'C), body tattoo<br/>\nMeans: Fast<br/>\nMotive: Pride<br/>\nOpportunity: Trusted<br/>\nM.O.: Got connections<br/>\nDisorder: Roots for the underdog<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter concept: Obsessive-compulsive tough-guy<br/>\nName: none yet<br/>\nSex: M<br/>\nAge: 17<br/>\nLooks: vascular, dreadlocks, tall<br/>\nMeans: Tough<br/>\nMotive: Altruism<br/>\nOpportunity: Pretty<br/>\nM.O.: Intimidation<br/>\nDisorder: OCD<br/>\n<br/>\n(the player for this YO had to leave a little early, so there's a few blanks we'll be filling in through e-mail)<br/>\nCharacter concept: angry visionary<br/>\nName: none yet<br/>\nSex: M<br/>\nAge: none yet<br/>\nLooks: none yet<br/>\nMeans: Bad<br/>\nMotive: Outrage<br/>\nOpportunity: Sneaky<br/>\nM.O.: Fast Talker<br/>\nDisorder: None yet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the session we were all really stoked to see where things go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm slightly nervous since it's been a while since I've run anything -- a couple sessions of Burning Wheel 2 years ago. Luckily there's not a terrible amount of pressure on me for running Misspent Youth. I think most of the pressure I feel is that it's a new game for all but 2 of us and I'm still trying to wrap my head around the scene structure. So, I'd welcome any feedback/comments anyone might have on what we have so far, especially any thoughts on using the Systems of Control to fuck with their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully I'll have a follow-up in about a week after our next session.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231662/#Comment_231662" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T09:52:23+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  9:52AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks pretty solid, minus the bits of characters that aren't yet fleshed out.

Don't worry about being a little out of sorts. You'll pick it up quickly and Misspent Youth takes a lot of pressure off you as GM. Follow the story procedure and know your goals for each act, or whatever Rob is calling them now. <br><br>The second system of control is hot ("Because the world is so connected there's a lot of pressure for people to isolate themselves and communicate solely through technological means (and of course the preferred means are all from BTL)"). Use that as much as possible in play. Set up situations where the YOs need to talk to other people and they have to use VR and text and vidphone and whatever else to communicate.

It's a bit long as I'm trying to include it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n[align=center]-EPISODE 1-[/align]<br/>\n<br/>\n<u>Authority Figures</u>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n1. Hogg, boss of the clique at The Data Mine (hey, noone said we couldn't have a little fun with our names)<br/>\n2. B.e.T.H. (Better Than Human, pronounced Beth) - Advance BTL A.I.<br/>\n3. Old lady Johnson the nosy neighbor<br/>\n4. Oscar Jiminez, local sheriff. (Note: pronounced with a hard "J", because he shuns his ethnic background. Wants to fit in, etc.)</ul>\n<br/>\n<u>Friendship Questions</u>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n1. Victor: Why do you (Tyr) let Jason bully you around?<br/>\nTyr : The time I didn't let him push me around, there were consequences at work.<br/>\n(We decided that Jason is a huge brown noser (to Boss Hogg))<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Tyr: How did you (Hiro) cope after the FDA crackdown that took junk foods off the market?<br/>\nHiro: I prepared myself be detoxing myself. By the time junk food wasn't available, I was already on a healthy diet.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Hiro: Who taught you (Jakey) how to hack?<br/>\nJakey: The guy that taught me to hack is the same that gets me my drugs: Chris.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Jakey: I know what you (Victor) did, why don't you think I'll tell?<br/>\nVictor: You need something from me.<br/>\n(This was by far our favorite friendship question -- HOT)</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>What's Up</b><br/>\nQuestion: Jason's bullying<br/>\nAF: Jason &amp; Hogg<br/>\n<br/>\nThe clique is working on the line at work. Picture a factory floor with conveyor belts and such. The clique works on the same line. Tyris at the end doing quality control. Jason comes over and dumps the bucket of bad parts into the bucket of good parts that Tyr's been separating. Drama ensues and eventually Jason just walks off. As he's walking away, Hiro goes after him and throws something at him. It's at just that moment when Boss Hogg comes around the corner to check on things. Struggle!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 1</b><br/>\nObjective: The entire clique gets written up for disciplinary reasons. (That'll be a second strike for Tyr!)<br/>\nHope: Jason loses face in front of Boss Hogg<br/>\n<br/>\nTyr gets in Boss Hogg's face (M.O. - Intimidate) to get him to back off, but he's having none of it. Hiro goes on a tirade (outrage) about the down-trodden. Hogg says he's one to talk about class this and class that because at least Jason is trying to better himself. In the mean time Jakey tries faking some errors into Jason's work (hacking). Hogg has some assistants looking into the errors then Jakey tries getting some pity (Orphan), but eventually Victor loses because Boss Hogg knows he has connections (M.O. Got Connections) with the president of a competitor: A. Tech, Inc and accuses him of being a spy. Everyone gets written up and Hogg is going to be keeping a closer eye on the group for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Kickoff</b>: How is the clique going to deal with Boss Hogg?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fighting Back</b><br/>\nQuestion: What Victor did.<br/>\nAf: B.e.T.H.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next morning on the way to work, Jakey &amp; Victor get a video message. It's a video of Jakey meeting with Anthony Patrick, the President of A. Tech, Inc. After a bit of role-play Tyr &amp; Hiro also receive the video and Victor reveals that Anthony is his father! The clique starts arguing amongst themselves about the video, but because they're paranoid they're doing everything via text. Picture 4 teenagers sitting around a table furiously texting each other while shooting them dirty looks. Awesome! Things die down a bit, so I call for a struggle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 2</b><br/>\nObjective: Make it publicly known that Anthony is Victor's father.<br/>\nHope: Discredit Boss Hogg<br/>\n<br/>\nJakey starts out by discovering that the messages originated from a BTL server somewhere (hacking). Hiro loses and decides to sell out his sneaky! He manages to edit the videos in such a way that it looks like Boss Hogg made the video. He also splices audio from other videos of Anthony Patrick to make it look like whatever's going on in the video is illegal -- paying for drugs, child porn, whatever dispicable acts he could throw in and proceeds to distribute it across the internet. Oh, and he doesn't tell anyone about what he's done. Untrustworthy, indeed!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Beat 1</b>: Discovery: Anthony Patrick is Victor's father!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Heating Up</b><br/>\nQuestion: Junk food being outlawed<br/>\nAF: Miss Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scene starts with Tyr &amp; Jakey sitting around Tyr's garage. We establish that even though they're illegal, they manage to have a stash of junk food. Hiro and Victor come in arguing. Victor's upset about the video being circulated. Hiro doesn't see the big deal because Hogg and Anthony are both part of the system and it hurts them both. The whole clique joins in on the argument at this point (in the meanwhile, the camera pans over to show Miss Johnson snooping around and eavesdropping). At one point it's established that Tyr has put a ridiculous amount of planning into taking care of Jason (yay OCD). I can see a rift quickly forming between the clique so I want to come up with a conflict that might help get them back together. At one point while pacing around Tyr angrily slams his hand into his door and hears a yelp from outside. It's old lady Johnson!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 3</b><br/>\nObjective: Miss Johnson reports the clique to Sheriff Jiminez for gathering together (gatherings are frowned against per a System of Control).<br/>\nHope: The clique gets closer together.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyr immediately goes outside to help her (altruism) because she nearly fell when the door came open. Hiro comes up with a story (fast-talker) about the 4 of them rehearsing for a short play at work that showcases bad workers. Victor immediately comes to his aid (wins by rolling what Hiro rolled for fast-talker) and embellishes the play story a bit. Old lady Johnson buys all of it and even seems to think a little better of the 4 of them for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI narrate a bit more and tell them that after getting Miss Johnson to go away they all start remembering why they're friends in the first place and that arguments will happen, but they'll always get past it. Things are looking better and they talk late into the night about good times.<br/>\n<br/>\n(to be continued because there's a character limit, apparently)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot" title="pseudoidiot"><img alt="pseudoidiot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/088/nR7LYU6Y43D2M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot">pseudoidiot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232917/#Comment_232917" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T20:42:21+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  8:42PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>We Won</b><br/>\nQuestion: Jakey's drug/hacker connection<br/>\nAF: Sherrif Jiminez<br/>\n<br/>\nA week or so has gone by and Jakey's managed to be clean for 7 days. As they walk into work they're whispering about the plan Tyr has about dealing with Jason in his safe. Time passes at work and Tyr notices quality going way down (Jakey's disorder is that he's so much better on drugs). Tyr takes it upon himself to fix that and slips some drugs to Jakey. He goes off to the bathroom and Hiro follows him to make sure he doesn't go too far. Just as Jakey's finishing up, Jason walks in and catches them. He immediately calls the police to report the drug use.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 4</b><br/>\nObjective: The clique gets arrested<br/>\nHope: Jason is framed for the drugs and gets arrested<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing about the plan, Victor sees his chance and runs (Fast) and plants a bunch of drugs and money in Jason's locker (not a personal stash, like a distributor stash). Jason goes on about how they're done for now because they've finally been caught. Tyr makes sure noone is seen by distracting the female security guard watching the cameras (pretty) and plants a device to erase any offending footage. The sheriff shows up on the scene and starts questioning workers on the floor Hiro gets a little closer to Jason trying to talk him down (untrustworthy) and slams the syringe of drugs into his side (leaving the needle there). Jason throws the needle across the floor just as the sheriff walks in. As he's trying to take in everything, Jakey fails and sells out Orphan. He plays the victim card and goes on about how big mean Jason has been pushing all these drugs on him, making him take all this stuff that he doesn't want to. All the drugs &amp; money in Jason's locker is found, and he's arrested and taken away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>We're Fucked</b><br/>\nQuestion: Jakey's drug connection<br/>\nAF: B.e.T.H. &amp; Chris<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scene starts with the clique hanging out in Tyr's garage again when there's a knock on the door. It's Chris, Tyr's supplier. "Hey man, where've you been? You haven't called. You're my number one customer!" There's a bit of back &amp; forth and eventually Chris opens his coat to display a large amount of wares. Jakey starts licking his lips and digging for money, but before he can get everything together Tyr shoves some money at Chris and buys some drugs he knows Jakey isn't into. By the time Jakey looks up Chris is driving off, happy for getting paid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince there wasn't a real need for a struggle there, where kind of at a loss of how to proceed. We decide we want to come back to the video of Victor and Anthony. I decide it's a good time as any for BTL to start being a little more prominent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 5</b><br/>\nObjective: BTL gets its hooks into the clique (per the first system of control)<br/>\nHope: Discover the anonymous sender of the original video (B.e.T.H.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTyr's been obsessively (disorder: OCD) going over inconsistencies in the video trying to discover anything about it. B.e.T.H. is doing all she can to cover her digital tracks so they don't find her. Then out of nowhere Hiro pulls out with a win (on Tyr's OCD roll). He's been so obsessed with covering his tracks that he spends nearly every waking moment away from work and the clique checking on the video online. Knowing previously that the original video came from a BTL server he starts looking that way and is able to discover that B.e.T.H. is an advanced AI system that resides on BTL systems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Beat 2</b>: Discovery: Who/what B.e.T.H. is<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Who Wins</b><br/>\nQuestion: Jakey's drug connection<br/>\nAF: Boss Hogg<br/>\n<br/>\nWe establish that whatever Tyr had previously paid Chris with could be traced to Boss Hogg. The scene starts on a fine Friday morning (Hawaiian shirt day -- gotta occasionally make the oppressed feel slightly lessed oppressed). It also happens to be a day that people from corporate are in the building and Boss Hogg is showing them around. (at this point it's getting late, so we start cutting straight to the struggle).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 6</b><br/>\nObjective: The local police (i.e. the sherriff) start coming down a lot harder on gatherings of people.<br/>\nHope: Boss Hogg is arrested for drugs and his connections with a known drug-dealer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHiro goes up to Hogg intending to make a scene (bad) and starts asking him when he can get some more stuff, if he's got anymore, etc. All in front of these corporate drones. Boss Hogg starts pushing him away and telling him to shut the hell up, what are you talking about? Jakey triggers a program he's been working on (hacking) that starts causing everything on the factory floor go crazy. Boss Hogg is now in damage control mode, trying to get things shut down, getting maintence to work on things. Tyr wins his next roll on Hiro's bad. He confronts Hogg and manages to plant some drugs and pull them out of Hogg's pockets in front of all these guys from corporate. They can't have that sort of thing going on. Between the chaos going on and the drugs, he's fired and also arrested.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Dust Settles</b><br/>\nQuestion: What Victor did<br/>\nAF: Anthony Patrick<br/>\n<br/>\nThe clique is at Tyr's place again when Anthony Patrick comes by to confront Victor about the video. He can't weather all this bad publicity. Again, things are getting late, so we cut straight to a struggle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot" title="pseudoidiot"><img alt="pseudoidiot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/088/nR7LYU6Y43D2M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot">pseudoidiot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232918/#Comment_232918" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T20:42:37+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  8:42PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>STRUGGLE 7</b><br/>\nObj: Plant surveillance device on Victor<br/>\nHope: The clique fills the power vacuum at the Data Mine since Hogg's firing/arrest<br/>\n<br/>\nVictor denies all knowledge of the original, unedited video (trusted). Anthony's having none of it, he shows Victor the unedited video and believes he must have seen it before. Jakey makes the point (smart) that cameras are everywher, could've been anyone. Anthony shoots back with sure, but not everyone has the resources necessary to get their hands on that sort of data. Must've been someone powerful. Hiro uses fast-talker to go on about in any society things like this will always happen to people in power and in the public eye. Anthony says maybe so, but to deal with things better in the future he needs a better line of communicatino with his son. Victor shoots back with "I'm not your dog to keep tabs on me!" (pride). Well someone has to, it's not my fault your mother brought you down here after the divorce. Tyr pulls out a win using Hiro's fast-talker. As he's trying to decide how to narrate the win we decide that with all the negative stuff pointed at the data mine lately that Anthony has managed to buy up the company. So at this point Tyr goes on abouw how he needs a trustworthy group to be in charge at the data mine. Anthony finally relents and agrees to put Tyr, as the oldest, in charge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>AFTERMATH</b><br/>\nThe YOs won scene 6, so they get a new exploit!<br/>\nWe decide that with the Data Mine being bought up, that cheaper technologies were becoming a viable alternative. So we erased the system of control that dealt with the poor not having access to technology. The new Exploit is that cheaper technologies that poorer people can afford are now becoming a viable option and that people will be a little less willing to make that first jump into what BTL offers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll follow up shortly with some general thoughts on the game so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot" title="pseudoidiot"><img alt="pseudoidiot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/088/nR7LYU6Y43D2M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot">pseudoidiot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232950/#Comment_232950" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T07:01:34+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  7:01AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, thoughts so far. This will probably be a bit disjointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, everyone had a really good time, I think. By the end of the session I think we were all a little more comfortable with setting up the scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it felt a little clunky to need to define a friendship question for the beginning of the scene. I wanted to focus on sticking to things as written as much as possible, so I tried to push to make sure the scene at least started right. Maybe one thing that took a little time to realize is that the scene, as a whole, doesn't necessarily need to focus on the friendship question chosen -- that's more a way to kick things off and to try and keep the clique's relationship in everyone's minds. I think that's the intention, but I could be off.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I was worried that there really wasn't much going on with BTL in this episode, but the more I think about it the more I don't really think that's a problem. Things are just getting started. I like the idea that in the beginning BTL wasn't really on the clique's radar. Sure, they know how BTL is, but more important to them was the situation at The Data Mine with their boss. In the end, I think that works just fine. Then I remembered that's even mentioned in the book towards the end; about how sometimes they start out knowing everything about BTL, but it can be just as fun having them discover all that. So, now I see it definitely going that direction. Time for them to start discovering some fucked up things BTL is doing! And now that they're on the radar, so to speak, because of everything that happened with Victor's father, it makes a lot of sense for BTL to start becoming more prominent in their lives. Before, the only reason I saw B.e.T.H. getting involved was to discredit Anthony, since he'd be a competitor of BTL's.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a hard time trying to match the flow of the game to the scenes as far as building up to a climax and all that. I think one thing that felt like it fell sort of flat was the struggle in Scene 5. It's supposed to be this big climax. First, I had a tough time coming up with a good struggle that I felt like went for the juggular, but before I could even get my feet under me, the YOs won on their second roll! I know it's going to happen sometimes, and it was still pretty awesome, but I wonder if there shouldn't be another way to increase the tension in that struggle aside from what numbers you picked.<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically, the first struggle felt a lot more tense, because the rolls happened in such a way that the entire conflict map was full of markers, and it finally came down to the last roll and whether it would fall on a YOs marker or the Authority's.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time (of two this first session) someone sold out a conviction was a pretty great moment. I could see how hard he was struggling with the decision. The whole time I was holding up a sharpie and grinning. Just waiting for him to confirm the sell-out so I could redact his character sheet. When he finally relented, I cackled with glee.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was honestly surprised by how well the kickoff and the two beats fell into place. I read through the scene structure section at least half a dozen times and I kept coming back to those. But once we actually played and the scene was over, it was pretty damn obvious exactly what all those should be. Especially the first discovery that Anthony was Victor's father. That was awesome!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother insight that just occurred to me. I'm starting to have ideas of things I can do to mess with the clique. But it requires having Authority Figures, and I technically have no real power over creating them. Sure, I can offer input and help flesh out ideas, but it's not actually my place to create an AF for a session. I'm kind of at the players' mercy as to what tools I'll have at my disposal each episode. It's an interesting dynamic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm super excited to see how the episode goes. This first session did a good job of stretching everyone's creative muscles, I think. Kind of like a warm-up. With one session under our belt, I have high hopes of the next session really popping, especially now that I'm starting to have a few flashes of inspiration of how I can push against the clique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232960/#Comment_232960" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T08:01:40+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  8:01AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great AP report, Jeremiah! Fantastic! Especially the last post. I care more about what you and the players did than what the characters did, though obviously the fiction stuff is necessary for context.<br><br>Hopefully, the rules talk about The Authority grinning with glee as they take a black marker to the YOs sold-out convictions. It's an important part of the game when I run it, and I think it should get codified (if it isn't already).<br><br>As The Authority, your role in creating Authority Figures is pushing back on the players when they come up with weak choices. Encourage them to make stronger choices, with teeth. Also, in play, there's nothing wrong with tweaking them a little as long as you stay faithful to the players' original vision for the AFs. <br><br>You're right that the GM is totally at the mercy of the players in Misspent Youth, though. If they don't bring the awesome, there's only so much you can do as GM to fix that. Keep a crib sheet of the YOs' convictions and push on them really hard. <br><br>Since you're playing out a series, you have more time to get into things. In a one-shot game, you want to get to the BOOM quickly, but if you have a half dozen or a dozen play sessions, you can tease out the story. It'll be fine. (I've never run a Misspent Youth series, though, so I'm mostly making educated guesses based on my knowledge of the rules and years of GMing experience.) <br><br>It sounds like you guys have an awesome thing going.

Just the image of these 4 teenagers walking along (and later standing around the backroom) starting daggers at one another while they argued over text was brilliant. I even pointed out at one point they could actually speak, because they were alone and they preferred to keep up with the texting. Brilliant!<br/>\n<br/>\nB.e.T.H is who got that scene rolling by sending the video to the kids. Honestly I didn't have a real motive for her to do so, but it seemed like a decent way to start fucking with them.

Many times it's only "about" the question relationally. You asked about the sexual relationship between our characters, and the scene involves a different pair of friends having sex, or maybe enemies having sex, or something. Sometimes it winds up being about the question directly. <br><br>For example, in the game with Julia, Meg, and Vincent, Meg asked me "Why haven't you slept with me yet?" and I said, "Because I don't know you want to." When we had a scene that was about that, we kept playing with her making subtle passes at me and me missing them, or me holding her hand because I was excited or happy and not realizing what it was doing to her.<br><br>I find that you get direct aboutness more when the issues raised by the question are unresolved. Or at least, that's what seems likely to me so that's what confirmation bias winds up having me seeing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pseudoidiot</cite>Yeah, it's pretty much just antagonistic. And not just between Tyr &amp; Jason. It was pretty obvious right away that the entire clique disliked Jason.</blockquote>\nThat scares me. The game is definitely supposed to be about friendship. I'll be interested to see how it goes.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pseudoidiot</cite>Yeah, being the first struggle, I didn't want to be too harsh too fast. It seemed right that failing the struggle would be a sort of last chance thing. Not a complete disaster, but they'd be on thin ice. Maybe I was too soft.</blockquote>\nWell, you know, if it worked for you it worked for you and that's fine. I always try to get right up to the edge of "obviously we'll sell out for that" but a) I don't always succeed and b) that may not be everyone's playstyle. Again, I'd be interested to see how a different style of play (if that <i>is</i> in fact your style) winds up working out.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pseudoidiot</cite>B.e.T.H is who got that scene rolling by sending the video to the kids. Honestly I didn't have a real motive for her to do so, but it seemed like a decent way to start fucking with them. I definitely see her being a lot more in coming episodes, so hopefully we get to see more about her motivations.</blockquote>\nI was more concerned that The Authority didn't have a presence in the conflict. When you're raising and saying things, it's supposed to be The Authority taking action. YO vs. YO conflicts are expressly forbidden.<br><br>(By the way, if it ever seems like I'm scolding you for playing wrong, I sure hope you understand that that's not what I intend. I may let you know what's "correct" but it's not out of disappointment or upset.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pseudoidiot</cite>Could you explain a bit more about what you mean by "You totally have the power to introduce that failure but the YOs should also be playing into it."</blockquote>\nSure. I think I was thinking a little too inside my own head.<br><br>So, it's scene 5. Something terrible has to happen to the YOs. I can START THE SCENE by saying that they get home and open the door and find their families murdered with an AF playing fingerpaints in their guts. Or I can have the struggle happen, then cut from a successful struggle to the same exact thing. I have power as The Authority to do whatever I want in the world.<br><br>I can go more subtle, as well. I can let you as players know that a mole is now in your group, and you as players are expected to totally bend over and take it and enjoy it. Give him access to your secret headquarters. Tell him the terrible plan you have worked out. You players want this to be a tragic moment, too, because you'll have a lot more fun if it is.<br><br>Does that make it clear?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot" title="pseudoidiot"><img alt="pseudoidiot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/088/nR7LYU6Y43D2M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot">pseudoidiot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233305/#Comment_233305" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T14:32:07+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  2:32PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">That scares me.

Kevin White -- consultant, "a suit."</ul>\n<br/>\nNote: At this point we started realizing that just about every character except for the players have had pretty vanilla names, and we all liked the tone that set. Here's all these authority figures with bland, vanilla names. Kind of neat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<u>Friendship Questions</u>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n1. Tyr to Victor: Q: "Are you ever going to forgive me for Vanessa leaving you for me last year?\u201d A: \u201cTOO SOON! I'm not ready to deal with that, yet!"<br/>\n2. Hiro to Tyr: Q: \u201cWhy don't you trust me?\u201d A: \u201cNoticed a change in you after Anthony's video went public\u201d<br/>\n3. 1)Victor to Hiro: Q: \u201cWhat are you doing with all the money you borrow?\u201d A: \u201cUsing it to educate myself and build up my knowledge.\u201d</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>What's Up</b><br/>\nFQ: Are you ever going to forgive me for Vanessa leaving you for me last year?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe YOs discover Vanessa just got a job as an assisstant to some executive at BTL. There's a lot of banter between Tyr &amp; Victor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 1</b><br/>\nObjective: Vanessa will seduce Tyr and wrap him around her finger.<br/>\nHope: Vanessa becomes an insider at BTL for the clique.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe struggle focuses mostly on Tyr &amp; Vanessa, with a little help from Victor, but Tyr loses and sells out pretty into vain to pull through with the win. Plays hard to get and gives her the cold-shoulder all night and she falls for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Kickoff:</b> Can the clique infiltrate BTL?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fighting Back</b><br/>\nAF: Beth<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter hours, Tyr convinces Vanessa to sneak him into BTL -- unbeknownst to her Hiro &amp; Victor are following.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 2</b><br/>\nObjective: Clique will be \u201cdetained\u201d by BTL security.<br/>\nHope: Find out who sent videos and why?<br/>\n<br/>\nHiro makes a distraction (bad) and he and Victor start making their way into their building. In the meantime, Tyr snaps (loses and sells out tough to vicious. He starts snapping security guards' necks left &amp; right, clearing a path for the clique. The clique finally knows that B.e.T.H. (the AI they discovered last episode) is the one that sent out the original video of Victor &amp; his father and that her primary focus is to locate and deal with potential problem groups (like the clique).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Beat 1:</b> discovery: B.e.T.H. sent the video and her primary goal is to pre-empt possible problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Heating Up</b><br/>\nAF: Kevin White<br/>\n<br/>\nA few days later the clique is hanging out in the breakroom at The Data Mine. That morning a consultant from the parent company, A. Tech came in to check on the place because profits had been going downhill.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 3</b><br/>\nObjective: Kevin plants hard/software in Datamine to spy on them for BTL<br/>\nHope: Clique convinces Kevin their way of running Data Mine is better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe struggle alternates between scenes of Kevin attempting to plant bugs and subvert security and the clique trying to convince him their methods will pay off in the end. Tyr eventually wins with altruism. He goes on about how employee happiness is a good investment and that overall efficiency will improve.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>We Won</b><br/>\nAQ: What are you doing with all the money you borrow?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the hangout, Victor just got a call from an acquaintance of his calling in a debt. So he decides to call in Hiro's debt to him. Hiro goes with his untrustworthy to color his actions and manages to steal funds from BTL by fiddling with their financing servers. I go ahead and let him have it, because I want the next struggle to be about not getting caught for the crime.<br/>\n<br/>\nVanessa shows up to warn the clique just minutes before Anthony shows up. BTL doesn't have anything concrete, yet, but Anthony's heard enough rumors that he's trying to nip it in the bud.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 4</b><br/>\nObjective: The clique will be out of a job<br/>\nHope: BTL outsources something to the Datamine, requiring datamine's access into BTL building.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe clique and Anthony argue back &amp; forth for a while. In the end Victor loses and sells out trusted to Believer. He manages to calm everyone down and goes on about how wrong it was for someone to steal from BTL. He doesn't know anything about it (Hiro didn't tell anyone what he did), but he's sure they can find out what happened to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>We're Fucked</b><br/>\nAF: B.e.T.H.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe clique's been trying to set up backdoors into BTL's servers to delete any traces they may have left from the night they broke in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, in a dark basement somewhere, BTL already figured out Vanessa has been involved with the things going on and have her strapped down in a chair, torturing her for information. She gives up the clique pretty quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn't survive the torture.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE 5<br/>\nObjective: BTL takes down the data mine.<br/>\nHope: Convert B.e.T.H.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe struggle's over almost immediately, with Victor losing and selling out pride to become arrogant. He converses with B.e.T.H. "I'm the master, you're just a tool; just some piece of software." He lays it on pretty thick and suddenly the clique has a new ally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Beat 2:</b> Reversal: B.e.T.H. switches sides.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: Tyr's player had to cut our early, due to the mountain of pizza we'd eaten having its revenge. We decide to continue and push through the remaining two scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Who Wins</b><br/>\nAF: Anthony Patrick<br/>\n<br/>\nThe clique decides they want a meeting with Anthony Patrick.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 6</b><br/>\nObjective: Place a new boss at the datamine<br/>\nHope:  Gain autonomy, datamine is no longer a part of A. Tech. Becomes it's own company.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe clique is trying to convince Anthony their way of running The Data Mine is the best. He's not happy with the profits, or the lack thereof. Hiro loses and sells out outrage to wrath. "FINE! You want this to be about numbers?" He storms out and contacts B.e.T.H., "take him out!" Over the course of the next couple weeks, Anthony Patrick and A. Tech Inc suffer financial catastrophe after catastrophe, leading to complete financial ruin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Dust Settles</b><br/>\nAF: Kevin White<br/>\n<br/>\nA month or so later, with Anthony out of the picture, The Data Mine is starting to flourish. They're doing the rounds just before a scheduled interview. They prepare for the interview and Kevin White walks in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>STRUGGLE 7</b><br/>\nObjective: Kevin gets hired at the Data Collective \u2013 still a BTL operative<br/>\nHope: Turn Kevin into operative for Data Collective<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin's doing his best to talk himself up as much as possible. (funny sidenote: I actually started feeling like I was in an interview and nearly clammed up. fuck, I hate being interviewed). Hiro &amp; Victor are giving him the spiel of the right way to do things. Victor wins using his M.O. "got connections": "I know what you're up to, Kevin. I can get you out of that mess with BTL. But we want you heart and soul. We'll get that monkey off your back."<br/>\n<br/>\nBAM! Two AF converts in one night! Time to start pushing back hard next episode.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>AFTERMATH</b><br/>\nWe add a new exploit: B.e.T.H., a powerful BTL AI, is under the clique's control.

One part that I think got missed was that when Tyr snapped, he shoved Vanessa out of the way, knocking her pretty hard into the wall, which was an important part of Tyr's character development in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\nI'm definitely enjoying the game.  Thanks again for all the feedback and the opportunity to play test.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot" title="pseudoidiot"><img alt="pseudoidiot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/088/nR7LYU6Y43D2M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot">pseudoidiot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236087/#Comment_236087" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T08:40:07+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  8:40AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah, I'd forgot about Tyr slamming Vanessa into the wall. I'd forgotten what happened to her in that struggle, I just remembered she got left behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I think I would've liked to keep Vanessa around a little longer. I liked the interplay between her, Tyr, &amp; Victor. Victor was definitely on the path of trying to win her back. However, I saw the chance for the authority to do something particularly brutal when I was at a loss for any other ideas. Also, thinking back, I don't remember of B.e.T.H. revealed that BTL tortured &amp; killed Vanessa. It could very well be that the clique isn't aware of what happened to her at all. That could still be a lot of fun to play out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could definitely see all 3 players struggling over the decision to sell out. Hopefully my objectives weren't so harsh that the decision was very easy. Although I would like to see them straight-up lose sometimes, it's still fun to watch them keep sliding down that slope of selling out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I don't have the character sheets in front of me, but I believe Tyr, Hiro, &amp; Victor have each sold out two convictions and Jakey has sold out 1 (of course, he wasn't at this last session). Also, noone's touched their M.O., yet. I'm looking forward to the first M.O. to get sold out so we can come up with something cool for it to sell out to.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently there are 3 Systems of Control, down from the original 4 -- 1 got converted. And 3 exploits.<br/>\n<br/>\nA thought just occurred to me. "Who Wins" determines the winner of the episode and whether there will be a new exploit or a new system of control. If I make the objective for that scene's struggle very harsh, it makes the decision to sell out that much easier. However, if I pull my punch a bit and they lose, suddenly it's an entirely different decision. Instead of "is it worth it to sell-out to keep the authority from getting their objective", it's now "is it worth saving my conviction to let the authority win this episode?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236268/#Comment_236268" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T21:17:43+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  9:17PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh: I'm so glad you're enjoying the game as much as you are.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pseudoidiot</cite><br>A thought just occurred to me.

Bill = outside businessman with an interest in the Data Collective</ul>\n<br/>\n<u>Friendship Questions</u>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n1. Hiro to Victor. Q: "I overheard you talking to your dad. Are you making amends? Gonna help him out?" A: "Mom was pushing me to stay in touch, she's still got feelings for him. I don't care what happens to the bastard."<br/>\n2. Victor to Tyr. Q: "It was good to see Vanessa. Things still good between you two?" A: "I thought so, but she hasn't been returning my calls."<br/>\n3. Tyr to Hiro. Q: "Hiro, last night you trashed the hangout. When are you going to lay off the sauce?" A: "I promise that was the last time."</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 1</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe scene opens with Kevin (at the end of last episode had been "converted" by the clique) finding some sort of device connected to a computer at the Data Collective. He reports to the YOs that it's used for spying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Bill discovers B.e.T.H.<br/>\nHope: Find out who planted the device and feed them false information.<br/>\n<br/>\nBill &amp; his tech crew are trying to cover their tracks while the YOs are trying to shore up their security. In the end, Victor makes a losing roll and decides to take the loss. I narrate Victor finding out a little about Bill and seeing the use in having a savvy businessman involved with the Data Collective and so hides the existance of one final spy device. Based the narrative on Victor's 'Believer'.<br/>\n<br/>\nKickoff: Can the clique keep control of B.e.T.H. &amp; the Data Collective?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 2</b><br/>\n<br/>\nHiro's in his office deep into a bottle when he gets a report about a Juan Whitmore, an employee that had left suddenly recently. Until now there was no need for alarm, but the report states that he's been seen at BTL. Hiro flies off the handle, cursing, throwing furniture, etc. At this point Tyr &amp; Hiro don't know about what Victor did from the previous struggle. Hiro starts ranting about being betrayed while Victor is trying to probe for more information worried that he's been found out.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually Hiro calms down a bit and the whole story comes out. They decide to check out Juan's place where he lived with his family. The place is empty, but Tyr (thanks to OCD) notices a number of things that don't add up and eventually comes to the conclusion that Juan and his family had been taken.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Obtain every intimate detail of the clique (through Juan)<br/>\nHope: Get Juan back to the collective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe struggle starts with Fisher trying to convince Juan of the pros of working for BTL. At one point he even brings out Juan's formerly ailing grandfather now in great health because of BTL technology. In the meantime the clique tracks down the security HQ. In the end Hiro makes a losing roll and sells out Bad to Perverse. He manages to get a knife off a security guard and maims him (taking care not to kill) and eventually forces a hostage swap when he gets his hands on Fisher's 2nd-in-command, "You've got 5 minutes until I start cutting pieces off this guy." As they exchange hostages, Hiro cuts a deep gash into the 2ic's face, "to remember me by."<br/>\n<br/>\nBeat: Fisher now knows the faces of the clique.<br/>\nAt first I wasn't happy with this since it felt too close to the objective, but everyone was cool with it, so I stuck with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 3</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSince the first scene, Victor has had some contact with Bill. Bill's a rich investor and interested in controlling the Data Collective (of course Victor doesn't know his interest goes that deep). Victor calls a meeting with the rest of the clique to discuss accepting Bill's help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Through tricky contracts, Bill obtains majority control of The Data Collective.<br/>\nHope: Bill sides with the clique, who now has powerful financial backing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBill tries to play up all his success stories of investing in failing companies which later flourish. The clique is trying to convince him what good his money could do, not just for the company but for the community. In the end Hiro wins with a roll on Tyr's Altruism and Bill is convinced of the utility of being involved with a company like the Data Collective trying to do good and donate to charities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 4</b><br/>\nAt this point, the YOs don't know Vanessa is dead (tortured to death last episode).<br/>\n<br/>\nTyr decides to check on Vanessa and discovers she's not home, then Vanessa's cranky landlady steps out going on about how Vanessa hasn't been around in a while and owes her rent. The clique convinces her to let them check out her place where they find stacks of unopened mail as well as a lot of voice mail messages -- mostly from Tyr, but a few from Victor, too (HA).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey decide the only answers they can get is from BTL so they decide to see if they can find anything out over the phone. They convince the land lady to let them use her phone. Important people at BTL get word of the call about Vanessa, which is suspicious seeing as how it's coming from her building, so they keep Hiro on the phone while Fisher gets a team in place to check things out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Publicize BTL's illegal tactics<br/>\nHope: BTL security apprehends the clique for.. "questioning"<br/>\n<br/>\nFisher's sending his guards in to search the place. Victor makes a call to a reporter buddy (got connections) and Tyr decides to make a scene by running out and knocking around some guards (vicious) then running off. A number of guards break off to chase him. Now Fisher knows who's in the building and his men start searching door to door. Victor grabs Hiro and goes up the fire escape to elude the guards.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end Tyr wins on Hiro's Fast Talking. He intercepts news vans coming into the area and spins quite the tale about BTL's deeds in the building. This leads to all sorts of huge news stories creating a huge scandal for BTL to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 5</b><br/>\nB.e.T.H. reports to the clique that something's wrong and a number of her systems have started glitching and she can't determine why. She soon realizes someone is access her locally with root access.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Glenn regains control of B.e.T.H. and rewrites her code so there's no question of her loyalty to BTL<br/>\nHope: Re-house B.e.T.H. in servers owned &amp; operated by the Data Collective<br/>\n<br/>\nBTL tries tripping up the clique by releasing footage of Tyr's vicious attack on the guards outside Vanessa's building as well as the mutilation of a guard by Hiro. The clique is trying to get resources together to find a new home for B.e.T.H. BTL starts kidnapping more Data Collective employees and some even show up dead. Morale plummets as fewer &amp; fewer employees actually come in to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end Hiro wins with Victor's "Got Connections" and they manage to get B.e.T.H. completely removed from BTL servers and even secure access to her a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeat: Catastrophe: Data Collective's employee morale has plummeted and a drastically reduced work force.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 6</b><br/>\nAt the clique's hideout they talk about getting some payback against BTL's programmers. They decide if they find the head guy and rough him up a bit they can scare the rest off and maybe they won't mess with the clique &amp; the Data Collective for a while. They commence to tracking down Glenn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: BTL secures a back door into the Data Collective's systems.<br/>\nHope: Intimidate BTL programmers to keep them from acting against the clique &amp; the Data Collective<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the loss of B.e.T.H. BTL is trying to catch up and get access into all sorts of competitors' systems. The clique is busy tracking down Glenn when they discover BTL programmers all have a security escort. That doesn't stop them of course and they start fighting them off. Hiro wins on Victor's "Fast" and manages to get Glenn away from his guards and commences to beat him up. Alot. But leaves him a live. Glenn and all the other programmmers are shaken. They didn't sign on for that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 7</b><br/>\nAnthony Patrick (Victor's dad) comes into the Data Collective. He'd previously been ruined thanks to B.e.T.H. (at Hiro's command). He's trying one last time to get his son out of the slums.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Anthony Patrick uses all the information he knows about the clique &amp; the Data Collective to buy his way into a job at BTL<br/>\nHope: Anthony Patrick becomes the cliques' inside man at BTL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony is focusing on Victor, telling him he's better than all this, while Victor and the clique are trying to convince Victor that working with them will be far preferable to working against them. In the end, Hiro loses and accepts the loss. His hot temper gets the better of him and it drives Anthony off into the arms of BTL.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>AFTERMATH</b><br/>\nBTL's public image is in the crapper. (thanks to the results of scene 4)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point I believe Hiro has 3 sold-out convictions (leaving just his M.O. &amp; his Disorder) and Victor &amp; Tyr have 2 each. Things are quickly approaching a head. One, maybe two, sessions should be enough to finish things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245161/#Comment_245161" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T13:53:06+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  1:53PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pseudoidiot</cite>After quite some time (over 2 months!) we finally were able to continue our game.</blockquote>\nReally glad to hear it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pseudoidiot</cite><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friendship Questions</span></br></blockquote>\nWhat was interesting about these is that they don't generally say "what does your and my friendship mean," know what I mean?

We did much better the second time around coming up with good questions. I think being rusty led to the same sort of questions that didn't poke at anything between characters much.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, we are still having fun, but I do remember feeling like the second episode popped a bit more and I think having the better questions probably helped with that.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Bohl">Robert Bohl</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">I'm glad that things are headed for a conclusion and I'm dying to see what happens.

I feel like scenes are going something like "this happened then this happened then this happened" with no real flow between them. But really that's more of a failing on my part than anything from the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also having more trouble getting scenes going that will lead to a conflict. I noticed more in this last session that as soon as a scene started it would go pretty much straight into a struggle with very little lead-in. On the other hand when there is a bit of stuff happening before a struggle, when it comes time to break out the dice it's not always a very smooth transition. Finding that happy medium seems elusive to me at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I'm definitely having a good time, though, and it's certainly stretching some gaming muscles I'm not used to using.

Steve Works - CEO/Founder of BTL ("Steve Works for you" HA)<br/>\n2. Paul Fisher - BTL head of security<br/>\n3. Todd Johnson - Corporate "fixxer" (decided we needed a bit of corporate espionage)</ul>\n<br/>\n<u>Friendship Questions</u>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n1. Hiro to Tyr. Q: "Why do you have those locked files you keep from Victor and I at the Data Mine?" A: "They're personal."<br/>\n2. Victor to Hiro. Q: "When're you gonna move out of my place? It's started to feel kind of crowded." A: "I'm working on it; I think I have a place I can move to."<br/>\n3. Tyr to Victor. Q: "When are you gonna call my sister back? She's been trying to get ahold of you. You know she's due in a couple months, right?" A: "I don't even know if that's my kid! I probably shouldn't even be talking to you about it. It's between her and I.</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 1</b><br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks have passed since the last episode. Things have quietened down a bit. Like usual the clique is hanging out in Tyr's garage when there's a knock at the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a very pregnant Tabitha (Tyr's sister -- we later retconned her into being his twin sister for maximum awesome). She's very upset and emotional.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Why don't you return my calls?"<br/>\n"This is your baby, you've got to take responsibility!"<br/>\n"Of course it's yours, don't you trust me? You were my first and only!"<br/>\n"You gonna let him treat me like that, Tyr?!"<br/>\n<br/>\n"You are gonna marry my sister. Right, Victor?"<br/>\n<br/>\nVictor manages to calm things down a bit and agrees to get tested. He just wants to know for sure. He promises to do the right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs they're getting ready to call it a night, Tyr gets a notification on his phone. An alarm is going off at The Data Collective (abbreviated TDC from now on).<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Sabotage some machinery in such a way as to cause a number of horrific accidents.<br/>\nHope: Expose Todd as an agent of BTL.<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd's breaking into TDC with some goons. While they're trying to distract the clique, he's going around planting small explosives and sabotaging equipment. At one point Tyr slams the hilt of his knife into a goon's head with enough force to break his neck and kill him (vicious)<br/>\n<br/>\nVictor loses. After breaking away from the goons he goes to the control room to turn on all the lights and start trying to find out what's going on. Instead of watching the cameras he's focused on doing diagnostics and Todd manages to get away clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day a number of machines on the floor fail and a few people are killed and many more are injured. Once again a major blow to morale at TDC.<br/>\n<br/>\nKickoff: Can the clique protect TDC from BTL &amp; their agents?"<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 2</b><br/>\nLater that night after getting things back in order Hiro heads off to his and Victor's place to start looking through the footage to try and find out what happened. Tyr &amp; Victor show up to find Hiro (once again) munching on some of Victor's food.<br/>\n<br/>\n"So how's the cake, Hiro? You can let Tabitha know since she made it for me."<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a bit of interplay between the roommates and eventually Victor says, "I say we snatch my dad and pump him for information."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe YOs track down Anthony Patrick under the pretense of Victor asking for help with the possible baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Paul Fisher kidnaps one of the YOs<br/>\nHope: Kidnap and pump Anthony Patrick for information<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony's a company man and sees Victor coming, before he even opens the door to talk to him he alerts BTL security. Fisher's on the way!<br/>\nThe clique is trying to convince him to come with them and Anthony's trying to stall them. Eventually Fisher shows up and a few cars surround the YOs.<br/>\nAt this point Victor wins on Tyr's altruism. He lays the guilt pretty thick on Anthony about his upcoming grandchild. Anthony's stuck wanting to help the clique or the company but he helps get them out of there through a back door. After they get away the clique holds him for some information gathering.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey get some information about Todd and discover he works for a company that does that sort of mercenary work for companies like BTL. I tell the PCs I'll also allow them to know things if it becomes important in a later scene<br/>\n<br/>\nBeat: Reversal: Anthony Patrick is a temporary ally because of the grandchild.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 3</b><br/>\nA few days later the clique is coming back from lunch -- Tyr had stayed behind to pay the tab.<br/>\n<br/>\nHiro and Victor arrive in the office to find Tyr's office has been broken into and his lockbox has been smashed open with files flung everywhere. That's the point when Tyr walks onto the scene, "So, uh... what's going on?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAs guilty as Tyr &amp; Victor look they convince Tyr they didn't do anything. He rushes them out so he can clean up the mess. They go to review security tapes. They quickly see a familiar face (Todd Johnson) breaking into Tyr's office and lockbox. At one point they manage to catch a glimpse of paper in his hands as he's flipping through a folder. All they can make out is Tyr's grandfather's first name: Steve. "Huh, wonder why that's so important to Tyr?"<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd makes off with the folder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other YOs don't realize it yet, but Steve Works is Tyr's grandfather!<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Discredit TDC with their peers because of Tyr's lineage.<br/>\nHope: Take Todd out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a big revelation for Todd as well and he needs to do some fact-checking. Tyr manages to track down Todd to try and convince him not to release anything. "There's nothing you can possibly offer me. I make more on a job like this than you make in a year."<br/>\nVictor calls (Got Connections) a team to go after Todd.<br/>\nHiro wins on Victor's 'Got Connections': Calls some contacts and gets the power shut down in the area so the team Victor called can do their work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey want to send a message with his death. A shot in the head and they blow up his penthouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyr recovers his folder. Victor snatches Todd's phone for later use.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 4</b><br/>\nA few days later Hiro is headed back to his and Victor's place. He gets in the door and is knocked unconcscious by one of Fisher's goons. A few minutes later Victor comes in and gets the same treatment. A little while later Tyr is wondering where they are and goes to check on him. The goons fail to get the drop on him and he fights them off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile Hiro &amp; Victor are trying to recover Victor gets a call from Tabitha. "I just got the results, the baby's yours! Oh, wait a sec there's someone at the door." Victor hears a scream and the line goes dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Tabitha is kidnapped and used as leverage against the clique<br/>\nHope: Clique gets a face-to-face with Steve Works<br/>\n<br/>\nFisher's making off with Tabitha. Tyr gets in contact with him and tries intimidating: "You come after my family? I go after yours. I know where you life." Fisher sends a team to secure his team, but the clique is faster.<br/>\nHiro loses and sells out fast-talker. We decide it sells out to Wormtongue.<br/>\n<br/>\nHiro goes to Fisher's place and has a conversation with his wife. "Do you know what your husband does at work? We have files and video of what he does... He just kidnapped a pregnant girl! She's just a kid!" He goes on and convinces her to take the kids and stay away from Fisher.<br/>\n<br/>\nFisher shows up and it's too late. With his family secured elsewhere the clique convince him to get them a meeting with his boss.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 5</b><br/>\nA couple of days have passed. In the meantime Steve and Anthony Patrick have been in contact with Tabitha trying to convince her she doesn't want Victor, that Anthony can provide for her and his grandchild and she'll be given all the support she needs. More than Victor could ever provide.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cliques get to Steve's office and he wastes no time in getting to the big reveal: "Only a grandson of mine could be causing me this much trouble!"<br/>\n<br/>\nHiro tries appealing to his better side: "Mr. Works, are you quite aware of how your company operates? The espionage? The kidnapping?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Oh, I'm quite aware of how my company operates."<br/>\n<br/>\n"And that's okay?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"The ends justify the means."<br/>\n<br/>\n"What's to stop us just taking you out now?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Oh, I highly doubt that."<br/>\n<br/>\nTiro whips out his phone, "BeTH, take him out."<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Permanently disable BeTH<br/>\nHope: Financially ruin Steve Works<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve's no slouch, his systems immediately detect the outgoing message and start tracing it. The clique tries talking him down at one point, "Listen, noone wants to go down the dirty, nasty path. Let's work this out like civilized people."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Civilized? Ha, like when you killed a man and blew up his penthouse? Or when you brutally maimed one of my guards? No, I think civilized left the table a long time ago.<br/>\nTyr loses and sells out Intimidation. We decide it sells out to Terrorism. "I don'tbelieve you realize exactly what sort of position you're in, grandfather. I've recently been meeting people more in line with my way of thinking. Why don't you check that terminal over there and look at your finances." At that point Tyr gives a signal and a number of teams blow up banks and other financial institutions. Any and all records of anything on Steve Works' name is destroyed for good.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeat: Discovery: Steve Works is Tyr's grandfather.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>SCENE 6</b><br/>\nShortly after the meeting with Steve, we see the clique back at Tyr's garage going over what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother knock on the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyr opens the door and doesn't see anyone in sight. He looks down and see Jakey's dead body. Dead of an apparent overdose. (Jakey's player hasn't been able to make it for some time because of real life commitments. We were sure he wouldn't have a problem with Jakey biting it for the sake of the story.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly there's an explosion down the street. It comes from the direction of Victor &amp; Hiro's place. The clique beats a hasty retreat just in time for Tyr's place to explode.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Destroy TDC (building)<br/>\nHope: BTL screws up and destroys something else (this may seem too inline with the Objective, but watch how it unfolds)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the clique is distracted wondering what to do about the destroyed buildings, Fisher is sending in a team to TDC.<br/>\nVictor uses his connections to get the word out. THIS IS WAR. THEY KILLED JAKEY.<br/>\nTyr uses Terrorism to retaliate. A number of BTL executives start their cars or open their home doors to be greeted by large explosions.<br/>\nHiro makes a winning roll on Tyr's Terrorism. He makes some calls and calls in a hit on a local orphanage. The clique apprehends Fisher and his goons in the act of planting charges at TDC. With the other explosions in the area, the cops don't need much urging to connect the dots to Fisher and his men.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decide one way or another this is going to be the last game. Hiro's only got one free conviction left (naive). Whether he actually sells it out or not during the next struggle, we're gonna call it. Things have progressed too far to continue much further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot" title="pseudoidiot"><img alt="pseudoidiot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/088/nR7LYU6Y43D2M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pseudoidiot">pseudoidiot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249652/#Comment_249652" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T08:40:15+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  8:40AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2010 8:45AM by pseudoidiot.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>SCENE 7</b><br/>\nThe next day we see Hiro in his office at TDC. He's been drinking. "What have we done? What have I become?"<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile the YOs are acclaimed as heroes for catching Fisher &amp; his goons. TDC is surrounded by press wanting to talk to the clique.<br/>\n<br/>\nVictor asks, "So how's it feel to be a hero?"<br/>\n<br/>\nHiro: "WE'RE NOT HEROES!"<br/>\n<br/>\nTyr can't stop washing his hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe clique is at rock bottom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTRUGGLE<br/>\nObjective: Find and distribute proof of Hiro's part in blowing up the orphanage<br/>\nHope: Take BTL out of the game. For good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve's busy using all his resources to track down who did the explosion. Victor tries putting him off the scent by making a call with Todd Johnson's phone; he hopes to convince Steve there's another player in what's going on. While he's distracted with the false lead, Hiro tries distributing some doctored photos trying to defame Steve. He even fakes up some evidence that make it look like Steve had a reason to have the orphanage blown up.<br/>\nIn the end Victor wins on Hiro's Wrath. He makes a call to their good buddy Kevin White (whom they'd previously planted at BTL). With his help, the clique reveals everything about BTL. All their illegal schemes and shady dealings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>AFTERMATH</b><br/>\nWith BTL gone, we remove the System of Control that once you drink of BTL's Kool-Aid there's no going back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>End of the Line</b><br/>\nBack from the very beginning, BTL's need was to have complete market control. They have most definitely not achieved this. (YOs have more exploits than the Authority has systems of control).<br/>\n<br/>\nHiro didn't actually sell out his disorder, but to have a complete ending we decide to treat it as if it were.<br/>\n<br/>\nVictor &amp; Tyr roll for their endings. Tyr gets a sad ending and Victor gets a happy. BUT WAIT!<br/>\n<br/>\nVictor sacrifices his happy ending and gives it to Hiro.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Victor: Sad</b><br/>\nVictor tries to be the father Anthony never was. He marries Tabitha and tries to support her and the child. But, it's just not enough. He doesn't love her and he's working at a soul-crushing job just to support his family.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, he becomes the thing he most detests in the world: he comes just like his father.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Hiro: Happy</b><br/>\nHiro manages to give up drinking and he stays at TDC. He leads the business to great success and spends a lot of time and resources making sure that people everywhere have easy access to cheap/free open-source technology.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Tyr: Sad</b><br/>\nAfter everything that happened, he just can't take it at first and has a complete break-down. After spending a number of years in a mental institution, he decides to found a new company: "The Best Life."<br/>\n<br/>\nWith his leadership, the company rises to prominence through various and sundry means.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the end, The Best Life is just another BTL and Tyr turns out just like his grandfather, Steve Works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
