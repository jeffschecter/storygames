It is set in a early rennaissance, dark fantasy world.<br/><br/>The website of the project is here: <a href="http://www.existanc3.com" rel="nofollow">www.existanc3.com</a><br/><br/>As this campaign is not specific to a system of play, and in fact, allows for a vast variety of gameplay, we intend to publish variations of various rules systems (13th Age, PathFinder, TSOY, FATE ... and SW). For more on the project, I've already discussed this, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18862/kickstarter-and-rpg-is-compatible-with-fate-pathfinder-worth-the-trouble-is-it-a-must" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>Just so you know, I have already "enrolled" Eero for TSOY and Cal Moore for 13th Age.<br/><br/>As much as we like SW, we're looking for some experts to write down the material for SW in the context of Avalanche. What we have in mind is mostly some guidelines and characters sheets. That said, we're not the experts, so you'll tell us what we need.<br/><br/>Please note:<br/>- This work will be paid.<br/>- This work will be part of a stretch goal and the work will only be commision if this goal is financed.<br/>- The final documents will be free to the world.<br/>- We're looking for some people who has some editing eperience and will be approved by the SW team.<br/><br/>On our website, you should find three teasers that will explain the project and note that one of those (the third one) is an actual 70 pages extract of Avalanche.<br/><br/>If you're interested, just send us a quick message.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for your time and interest.<br/><br/><i>Note: I'm also looking for a FATE compatibility. That said I think Fred pointed me in the right direction: this turns out to be a common FATE demand.</i><br/><br/>S\xe9bastien Pelletier                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427316/#Comment_427316" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T08:45:57+00:00" title="January 17, 2014  8:45AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The position has been filled.
