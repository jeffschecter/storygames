It will save you tonnes of work and hassle, and can be run in a single session or two.

You could ask your players to restrict the type of conflicts you use the first few sessions. Session 1, Circles and Resource tests. Session 2, Duel of Wits. Session 3, Psychology. Session 4, firefight. Session 5, technology. <br/><br/>I think the hardest and slowest part of the game is making characters. But you could start with 2-3 lifepaths at first to ease into the process which will make things much faster. After that it gets much easier. <br/><br/>GM prep wise, we never prepped anything. Worldburning will define all the areas of interest that you could have conflicts over. If you don't to have a conflict over the atmosphere and life support, don't spend much time defining it. Only pick factions you want to actually use in play. Keep worldburning focused. Then name the figures of note, the main characters on each side of the conflict. Noting that a figure of note on the vaylen side doesn't have to be vaylen or even know about them. Their actions just end up helping the vaylen. Theirs could be a tragic story. Once you lay all these characters out on a conceptual layer, ask the players which figures of notes they want to play or have some of them create supporting characters that tie into the existing characters and will step forward to take the spotlight. This starts to create a rough relationship map.<br/><br/>Then use beliefs to refine your relationships and to brew conflicts. Have the players write beliefs about what they want to have conflicts over. Have them aim those beliefs at other characters, PCs and NPCs. Have them aim them at factions. Then have the NPCs write counter beliefs aiming their efforts right back at the PCs. Remember, you can change beliefs in play and short term beliefs rock. A short term belief could be accomplished in 1-2 sessions. Or even the next scene! Make them direct and target them where the other side hurts.<br/><br/>Using all this information, besides having to make characters for key threats, I generally don't have to plan out a session. I just use everyone's beliefs to push the story forward.<br/><br/>The resolution mechanics may seem complicated but at their core are dirt simple. On a d6 1,2,3 is a no. 4,5,6 is a yes. If you have enough yeses to get what you want, you do! Generally situations, equipment, powers just give you more or less dice. Even in the extended mechanics, you choose actions and then compare them to see if you get less or more dice. You could get rid of dice all together and just flip coins. Heads is no. Face is yes. The book is large mostly because of all the lists and examples. Specific skills have different uses but don't bother reading up on skills that are not in play. They are easy to reference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177356/#Comment_177356" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T06:55:16+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  6:55AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2008 10:24AM by PaulB.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never heard of anyone's first Burning Empires game going well. Treat it as a learning experience, play through a few maneuvers, then go back and reburn everything from scratch. Everything you try and do will (probably) go poorly: players will not build game-effective characters (i.e. they'll be hot shit at conflicts but will whiff Infection, or vice-versa), worldbuilding will produce unexpected long term consequences (which I think is a hoot, but not all gamers are into uncertainty), the BIT/Artha cycle will be confusing, the Infection/game fiction disconnect will freak you out, the GM will try to "win" in a way the game doesn't support, etc. etc.<br/><br/>I say this as one of the biggest fans of the game you'll ever meet. Once I was able to play an entire Phase of BE, it was the single most rewarding RPG experience of my 30 years of playing -- but it was a steep, steep learning curve to get there.<br/><br/>Find my "getting past the first session" essay on the BE wiki for more advice.

If you want to learn the game and see what it does, run Fires. Read Paul B's essay, it's great. If you want to have fun burning characters, then run Fires, then go back and redo your characters, then go ahead. Burn characters and the world first and then run Fires and hope for the best case scenario: you all "get" everything that's going on in the game and realize how you should have created your characters and world in ways which supports that, so you have another character/world burning session.<br/><br/>YMMV, but it would have been nice if someone gave me that advice before I played BE for the first time. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177395/#Comment_177395" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T10:00:34+00:00" title="November  5, 2008 10:00AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to get this completely straight: We might be going into this with one of two agendas. <br/><br/>Agenda 1: To have fun as soon as possible.<br/>Agenda 2: To learn the game as thoroughly as possible.<br/><br/>I understand that for Agenda 1, we should definitely play Fires &amp; read the essay, then try to build a campaign from scratch.

But, yeah, it's a rock-solid game that requires you unlearn almost everything you know about how RPGs are supposed to work.

I ran Omac at Gamestorm 12 yesterday, and while it didn't go poorly (the players said they had a good time, and it was a demo, and we were trying out the system, so a few bumps are expected, etc.), it wasn't as fun as I had hoped--which wasn't at all the players' fault.

It took us several sessions to get a feel for what it was trying to do, and at that point we collectively wished we could have gone back to character creation and started over, but it was meant to be a half-dozen sessions long and we played it out as we were.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I'd say above everything else:  if a player says "Oh, I don't need to know the rules - you can tell me what I need when I need it" -- disinvite her.  Even if she is a great entertaining character actor.  Burning Wheel and its descendants really require full participation from all players for the game to be satisfying, and what I found was that the players who invested in the game were having a great time by the time we wrapped up, while that particular player was irritated at me that I wouldn't just give her fiat experience because she never managed to record her skill tests even when reminded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
