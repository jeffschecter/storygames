I like the GM and the particular group of players, but I've never been crazy about the system.<br/>I'm sure this has been brought up thousands of times before, but isn't this basically just a dice pool mechanic where the number of dice in the pool is based on the number of player characters?<br/>When you're rolling for perception everyone rolls and only the highest result matters.<br/>When you're rolling for diplomacy or computer use or knowledge: planets or whatever, everyone rolls and only the highest result matters.<br/>But when you're rolling for stealth only the lowest result matters?<br/><br/>And once I found out I could roll a skill check to gain a bonus to a future skill check, I just started rolling fistfuls of d20's for every skill I had points in whenever I knew I had an important skill check coming up. <br/>The GM has this houserule that gives you an extra 1d6 to add to any future d20 roll whenever you roll a natural 1. I started rolling for all sorts of little incidental things (like craft: cooking for a cup of space-ramen, which I botched) just to save up those extra d6's. I have yet to peruse through the rule book for synergy bonuses and item bonuses and circumstance bonuses. I'm just doing what I have to in order to mitigate the severe whiff-factor in this system.<br/><br/>I've offered to run 3:16 or Apocalypse World for my group. Let's see if I can at least get a one-shot going.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434192/#Comment_434192" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-22T17:05:26+00:00" title="June 22, 2014  5:05PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're making the game perform against its design precepts by abusing its subsystems like that - the D&amp;D 3rd edition system chassis is not intended for a weak GM and a rebellious player to engage in oneupmanship over legalistic readings of the rules text. (Yes, I know that this is an incredible claim - you hardly see anything else occurring around the game in the Internet.) You're basically engaging in shooting fish in a barrel by pointing out how the game mechanics don't work when used in ill faith, and apparently the GM is too uncertain about themself to establish clear creative guidelines.<br/><br/>I have no idea if this was what you wanted to discuss, but if you're looking for suggestions as to how to improve the game experience (as opposed to how to sabotage the game further so you can convince the group to play your favourite game instead), I would suggest stopping to think for a moment about what each of the other players in the game wants out of it, and then focusing on providing that. Odds are that the group doesn't want you to prick holes in the perceived fairness of the rules system; if Star Wars groups that I've seen are any basis to judge, they probably want you to contribute by playing a heroic character and focusing on roleplaying and pushing the plot forward with your actions, trusting the GM to take care of the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434196/#Comment_434196" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-22T21:55:47+00:00" title="June 22, 2014  9:55PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, this is actually an important point, and something I rarely see RPG texts address.

I mean, that's all in the rulebooks, isn't it?<br/><br/>The orthodox solution for 3rd edition D&amp;D and variants to this dice pool phenomenon varies case by case. For example, a sneaking check made by a group of five members vs. an observation check made by a group of five guards does not actually use worst result vs. the best result (that's a common house-rule, admittedly, and one that I use myself). Rather, the rule (in the 3.5 D&amp;D text, the most common variant) is one Listen check from the best listener in the group vs. the average of the Move Silently checks of the sneakers. That gives a minor advantage to the observing side of the equation, all other things being equal, which is as it should be.<br/><br/>As for knowledge checks, the general strategy for balancing those is to give them relatively high DCs to begin with. Also, remember that characters who don't have a rank in the given skill generally speaking can't attempt knowledge checks for that skill, which limits the dice pool phenomenon further.<br/><br/>As can be seen, the game tends to have nit-picky balancing features that differ from case to case, when it comes to many characters rolling for a task, or the same character retrying the task (another variation on the dice pool, the same character attempting the same task several times). In practice it takes either a GM with an intimate expertise of the rules text, or one who's comfortable with making their own rulings, to get sensible outcomes in various corner cases. It helps if the players participate actively in maintaining the group expertise in their local d20 implementation.<br/><br/>I haven't played any off the shelf d20 games myself for something like ten years, but I've been playing variations on D&amp;D, so the dice pool phenomenon is very familiar. I think it's an important part of how the game works, really; many elements in most flavours of D&amp;D outright assume that a single character's relatively low success rate is balanced by the fact that there'll be 5-10 tries at the task.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434200/#Comment_434200" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-23T00:18:08+00:00" title="June 23, 2014 12:18AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For perception and stealth the game is designed like that as written, but for most of the other skills, the OP's group appears to be thwarting existing mechanisms and norms built into the game to prevent this sort of exploitation.
