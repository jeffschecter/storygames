Banks' illness has inspired me to finally get off my duff and write that "Culture RPG adventure" that's been sitting in the back of my head for years. And having run my first Lady Blackbird session this week, I thought: why not do a LB hack for it? The system's a damn good fit.<br/><br/>This will be the thread of my attempt to bring this idea to fruition. I don't have much yet, but here's a start:\n<blockquote>THE BONKOEL were a peaceful, low-involved civilization renowned for the quality of their art and music. After millennia of unobtrusive existence, they decided to head off into the Sublime.<br/><br/>THE CULTURE, in their peaceful do-goodnik mode, sent a ship to observe the Jump to Infinite Fun: the GCU <i>All Over Bar the Shouting</i>, an avuncular ship known for its large and happy crew.<br/><br/>SECONDS before the Bonkoel were to sublime, their homeworld of Seiznem was suddenly destroyed utterly and completely by Gridfire. The only clue was a large black bird that displaced suddenly and temporarily onto the GCU, which it recognized as the distinctive avatar of the ancient, highly eccentric GSV(E) <i>Evening All Afternoon</i>.<br/><br/>NOW a hastily assembled team of Special Circumstances operatives race after the <i>Evening</i>, intent on unraveling this mystery before the other Involved Civs get...involved.<br/><br/><b>WHY DID THE EVENING DESTROY SEIZNEM?<br/><br/>WHAT SECRET DOES IT POSSESS?<br/><br/>AND IS THAT SECRET EVEN MORE DANGEROUS THAN A ROGUE GSV THAT COMMITS MASS MURDER?</b><br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>--Non-Culture human, SC operative [Think something like Zakalwe from <i>Use of Weapons</i>]<br/><br/>--Culture SC agent [Dziet Sma from <i>UoW</i> is an obvious model; see also Djan in <i>Matter</i>]<br/><br/>--Culture SC drone [Xuss, Skaffen-Amitskaw, Mahwrin-Skel/Flere-Imsaho...]<br/><br/>--Last survivor of the Bonkoel<br/><br/>--Culture non-SC human expert [Gurgeh in <i>The Player of Games</i> is obvious inspiration]<br/><br/>\x90\u2014(D)ROU <i>Sorry, But We Find the Ghoulish Humor Helps</i><br/></blockquote>\nI'll look into beginning to stat out the characters, and welcome help &amp; feedback. I think the first question that presents itself is, "Will the ship be a PC?"<br/><br/>(And yes, I'm completely bummed by the news. What a loss.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411321/#Comment_411321" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-04T16:14:55+00:00" title="April  4, 2013  4:14PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing the news, sad as it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411381/#Comment_411381" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-05T10:45:51+00:00" title="April  5, 2013 10:45AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I've progressed a bit. I'm finding that the hardest thing so far is to come up with the Traits and their Tags; I've got some fundamental block about what makes a good Tag or Trait.<br/><br/>That said, I've begun to do some work on the PCs. I've decided to, for the moment, cut the "Non-Culture SC Op" and instead go with the ship as a PC. Here's the skeleton of what I have so far. Comments and catcalls appreciated.<br/><br/><b>Larza</b><br/><br/>Special Circumstances Operative<br/><br/>KEY OF THE ADVENTURER<br/>\tYou\u2019ve always been a bit of a misfit in the Culture; you crave adventure, living at the edge of your abilities, and generally making life difficult for yourself. Hit this key whenever you manage to put yourself in a dangerous situation. BUYOFF: Accept that there are challenges you don\u2019t want to overcome.<br/><br/><b>DJIRIAN</b><br/><br/>Human Member of Contact and Larza\u2019s Former Lover<br/><br/>KEY OF THE RELATIONSHIP<br/>\tYou and Larza were lovers once (several times, actually, if you count the various configurations of gender.) You still hope to have a child with Larza, even if the SC operative isn\u2019t in the picture. Hit this key whenever you find a way to get closer to Larza romantically. BUYOFF: Give up hope of having a child together.<br/><br/><br/><b>HOMOTH</b><br/>Last survivor of the Bonkoel<br/><br/>KEY OF CREATIVITY<br/>\tAs a befits a Bonkoel Master, you spent several years living on the Ghoul, composing your masterwork about a warrior Mind\u2019s life. Hit this key whenever you do anything artistic, or you reveal some history about the Ghoul. BUYOFF: Finish your masterpiece<br/><br/>SECRET OF THE SUBLIME<br/>\tYour civilization was on the very cusp of crossing over into the Sublime. Once per session, you can reveal the secret behind a mystery by using your mysterious understanding of higher reality.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>PERIKAL-ALZABAN</b><br/>Special Circumstances Drone and Companion of Larza<br/><br/>KEY OF THE MACHINE<br/>\tYou\u2019re a drone, and proud of it; you think that even a 1.0 mind like your own is more than a match for any human. Hit this key whenever you demonstrate your superiority to biological life forms. BUYOFF: Accept that humans can be just as good at something.<br/><br/><br/><i><b>SORRY, WE FIND THE GHOULISH HUMOUR HELPS</b></i><br/>(Demilitarized) Rapid Offensive Unit and Friend of Homoth<br/><br/>KEY OF THE WARRIOR<br/>\tYou were created to fight, and you like nothing better than mixing it up and showing off your abilities. Hit this key whenever you get into a fight (the tougher the better) or intimidate someone with your martial prowess. BUYOFF: Pass up a good fight.<br/><br/>KEY OF THE BOON COMPANION<br/>\tYour avatar spent years with Homoth, learning about the Bonkoel, and drinking, partying and generally having an amazing time. Hit this key whenever you and Homoth work together to accomplish something. Especially if it involves bending the rules. BUYOFF: End your friendship with Homoth<br/><br/>SECRET OF THE DAREDEVIL<br/>\tYou\u2019ve been waiting your entire existence for your moment to really shine. Once per session you can reroll any failed roll provided the plan was daring, complicated, or excessively destructive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
