Well, it's true, but someone could do this for a game he would like very much... if it worked for him!<br/>\n<br/>\nCase in point:  Nathan Paoletta's <i>CARRY</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a game that I am really interested in, a game that I wanted to play very much, a game that I played enjoying very much some <i>moments</i> of play, so much to fan my enthusiasm...  but that after looking at it (and playing it) I think it's not complete, and has so many issues that it should still be in playtesting until they are solved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will try to explain why I think so, and what I would like to get from this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I would like to get some discourse going about the game. Because, while it seems much played at cons and gatherings, There isn't a lot of posted actual play after it was published. Really, sometimes it seems that, after a first period of interest (with a very enthusiastic blog post from joshua a.c. newman and a Forge actual play thread by Ron Edwards that was very positive, but signaled some of the problems of the game) nobody talk about it anymore if not in passing ("and I played Carry, too..."). This is really disheartening thinking about the potential of this game, a potential that I believe unfulfilled because of a premature publishing of the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second objective of this thread is, simply, to be able to fulfill that potential playing the game.  I hope that someone will explain to me why the game it's all right and I simply didn't notice the solutions I needed, or that the game is playable if I simply do some thing (not explained in the game) when I play it, or, if the game is indeed not fully baked, will help me bake at least a temporary solution (also called "house rules") to be able to play it until a revised edition is published (or an "official errata" take care of all the problems)  (and yes, I already tried doing this talking directly with the author, but with very little results, as I will explain later I was often simply ignored). So, this is not a review. I am asking for answer from people who already know and played the game<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's start with a little history of my interest in the game. It was brought after last year's gencon by a friend of mine, who was very interested by the setting and the idea of the game (my friend has even less experience with story-games than me, we are both very old-time roleplayers that discovered these games less than two years ago, but we are both very enthusiastic about them).  After hearing his description of the game, and after reading the blog post and the actual play thread cited above, I was very interested too. I brought my copy of the game book, I wrote Nathan to ask for the most recent errata (at that time, Febrary 2007) and some advice (that I received quickly. Among the advices was a different endgame rule, suggested by Ron Edwards in his actual play thread), and we scheduled a game session with some other out-of-town friends that was interested too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe made a lot of errors during the game, but we still enjoyed it very much. So much that my friend decided to organize a game of Carry at the next Italian <i>Ambercon</i> to show this little gem around. The little glitchs and the many problems, we ascribed to our errors and inexperience. I talked about that game, and I posted a lot of rule questions to Nathan, in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23593" rel="nofollow">this forge thread</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat thread list some problems we had with the unclear text of the game. Nathan answered (after a while) most of the questions, but not all. He didn't explain how the endgame and the multiple-rounds action scene (two of the most important mechanism) worked.  This even after I asked him again, in the forum and by e-mail.  At that time, reading his blog, I found out that he had decided to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/2007/04/09/and-so-it-goes/" rel="nofollow">leave</a> the internet, so I gave up on getting more answers. My friend tried to GM the game at the Ambercon anyway, and it was a bad day for story-games reputation at that Con. Both of the unresolved issues with the rules came out in play (Murphy rules...), and all the glitch and the dice complications of the game showed their worst aspect. This in a convention for people who like to play diceless or with very light rule sets and distrust dice (we hoped to show how dice don't have to detract from immersion and story, but it backfired).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend was maybe too enthusiastic about playing the game even without all the clarification we needed, but after the Con game showed us that the problems we encountered in the first game weren't caused only by inexperience or errors (and this showed the first game in a very different linght), and discouraged by the author's disinterest in our questions, he simply said that he was done with the game, that it was broken, and he didn't want to play it anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was uncertain. After the first game, I was very enthusiastic about some of the system features. I really liked the way the dice made for a close ecology, how they forced personality changes, how that system worked. After the second game, I still like some part of the system, but I am not sure they really work.  Unwilling to drop the game after only two tries, but without anybody to play it with, I began to search for other people's s comments about the game.  As I said at the start of the thread, I didn't found any.  Nor I found any new thread with actual play or rules discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a while Nathan Paoletta returned, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3148&amp;page=1#Item_5" rel="nofollow">posting</a> about the second printing of the game, and asking for questions. I replied reminding him about the question he still didn't answer in the forge thread. But still, no answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, he <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24204" rel="nofollow">posted</a> a new version of the endgame rules (the third one from the publication of the game, in less than a year. The fourth, counting a suggestion for playing the endgame in a somewhat ruleless way that Ron said he received by Nathan, in his actual play post. As far as I know the new printing of the game has still the first version), saying that he would START to use it  (playtest it) after then. In his words, "Thoughts? I'll post once I run it this way and I have a chance to see how it goes...."<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that time, I understood that he didn't have really have a playtested endgame rule that worked. (and this maybe explain the reason because he didn't answer my questions about the endgame). Thinking about the "ashcan" discussion at the Forge and Story-game from some months ago, I read again his old playtest thread at the Forge.  Looking at the dates, this time. He <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19272.0" rel="nofollow">posted</a> about a playtest where his game was called "Broken and Boring" (forcing a complete revision of the rules) at the end of march, only a few months before publication.  Some <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18800.0" rel="nofollow">other</a> playtest thread from that period show the big differences with the published systems, and that he was at the time still struggling with the engame.<br/>\n<br/>\n(more)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85480/#Comment_85480" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T23:27:02+00:00" title="August  3, 2007 11:27PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2007 6:25AM by Moreno R..">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In his <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21058" rel="nofollow">thread</a> about the game history at the forge, he say that after the revision he played THREE games at Dexcon (three games with the game author doesn't seem to me really a lot of playtesting) and then "The three games showed me the final tweaks I needed to make, mechanically (mainly dramatically streamlining Endgame and jiggering a couple of things about how Burdens work in Action Scenes), and also showed me that the game was good. All I had to do was get the physical labor done.".  So he didn't do more playtesting, even after having done some rule change (I think there wasn't the time, if he wanted to publish in time for Gencon), and printed the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd after one year, he is still playtesting the endgame rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, in my opinion, is a good example of how much an initiative like the Ashcan Front is praiseworthy and needed. If Carry had been published as an ashcan, with some good blind playtesting (without the author at the table), it could really have been a great game. It's already is, from what people say, when the author is GMing it.  But in his actual published form, it still isn't. It's an half-baked game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd these elegant rules with the flowing of a closed ecology of dice...  I am not sure anymore if its beauty serve the game's purpose, or not.  I don't trust very much anymore the answers of the game author (or him giving them to me) so I am asking feedback from the people who played the game.  Do you think that the game work well as printed? How? Can you explain it to me? (Ron Edwards, in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23771.msg233161#msg233161" rel="nofollow">one</a> of his replies in the "half-baked games" discussions, said that in his opinion "In the case of [..] or Carry, it means the book ended up having small gaps or flaws that made it a wee bit harder to use, but the book can indeed be used and the game itself is solid".  But "can be used" I think take a very different meaning when said by Ron Edwards than when said by someone who doesn't have many years of experience with narrative games or didn't talk in person with the game designer). Do you have some tweaks to suggest? Do you have a functional endgame rule to use?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing that I talked about the game "problems", all this time, I think I should list at least the ones I noticed more until now:<br/>\n<br/>\n- 1) the choosing of the dice at the start.  It's really a little thing,  but I noticed it got the game to a bad start at the Ambercon, because the players didn't saw the reason behind the complication. It told them "too many dice complications" right at the start. OK, it would not be a problem with a less diceless-friendly group of players, but I would like to get some feedback on this. Do any of you can explain the reason for this complication?<br/>\n<br/>\n- 2) During the Squad scenes, if the players don't gift dice to the GM, the GM is soon without dice. The players have no "game-reason" to give the GM any dice. They have to give them to him simply to have a strong opposition and don't win too easily the conflicts in the squad scenes.  Both times we played, the GM was always without dice. Nathan about this wrote "In all honesty, it's not particularly bad for the GM to be low on dice, it just tends to mean that the game tends to be more about how the characters overcome adversity than how they are divided and crushed by it.", but after playing again the game I don't agree. To overcome adversity, there should be some adversity. A guaranteed win is not adversity.<br/>\nAnd if the GM don't receive dice, the players get too many, and they don't change profiles.<br/>\n(by the way, the book text is wrong - and the game author agreed about it afterwards: the gifted dice are not at all like fan mail, they are given to people for tactical reasons, not to award "good play")<br/>\n<br/>\n- 3) this was one of my never answered questions:<br/>\n3302.b)"the GM frames the scene, explaining the situation. The situation should include enough information for the Ranking Officer to be able to give orders to the other characters. After the GM frames the scene, it is divided in a series of rounds.<br/>\n(3302.c) Each round, the Ranking Officer gives each grunt an order, as well as giving general orders to the squad as a whole. [...]. The GM then summarize the round, and narrates the consequences of each Grunt's action<br/>\n(3302.d)  An action scene can take any number of rounds. It is the GM's responsibility to pace the scene though his narration, and to call the scene at an appropriate point"<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, let's say I am the GM, and the Ranking Officer order Big White to kill a sniper behind a street window. I decided to pace the scene in two rounds, and this is the first.<br/>\nWhat can I tell to Big White's player? I can resolve his fight with the sniper using total GM's fiat, narrating what I want (even that he is shot and wounded by the sniper), or these are constraints? What can happen and what can't happen until the dice are rolled?<br/>\n<br/>\n- 4) During the Action scenes, people can decide pretty much how many wounded or dead will be at the end, by choosing the dice to give, and to who. The GM and the ranking officer can at most add one dice, against all the dice from the players. At the end if the players don't want to be wounded, they aren't, because whoever get to decide at the end has a pityful amount of harm to give around.<br/>\n<br/>\n- 5) Am I alone in having some problem in categorizing and differentiating the different approaches?  (many times we could have used two or three different approaches declaration, narrating the exact same action)<br/>\n<br/>\n- 6) The limiting power of the approaches depends of dice scarcity. If the Players have too many dice (because the GM don't have any) even the approaches seems an useless complication (this is what happended in the Ambercon game)<br/>\n<br/>\n- 7) The Endgame: I will not even try to summarize here the three different rules given at various times. You can read them in the game manual, in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23434.msg231122#msg231122" rel="nofollow">this</a> actual play post, and in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24204" rel="nofollow">this</a> post from Nathan.  Every one of the cause confusion in every endgame if the character don't neatly divide in pairs in different locations at the time.  Two of them have someone decide for another's character (Ron's version tried to avoid this, but the new one return to the idea).  I really don't like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Endgame, I will add a new condition. I will not be satisfied by any endgame rule where I (or any player) will not narrate the denoument AND the epilogue for our chartacter. The endgame rules should give us the order or narration and the condition we have to follow with our narration, not force us to have the last scene of our character narrated by another player.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny idea?

Thanks for the answer!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite><br><b>2) During the Squad scenes, if the players don't gift dice to the GM, the GM is soon without dice.</b>That also worked out just fine for us. If you win by a wide margin, the winning player has harm to give to squad members, and more than once Ben was left with a tragic amount of harm to deliver.</br></blockquote>\nHere you are confusing the Action scenes (the ones where everybody fights, and each player has to decide if he agree with the ranking officer strategy of not) with the Squad scenes (the ones where at the end of a conflict - that can be about everything, not only combat - every player must gift the dice he used to somebody who wasn't involved in the conflict).  <br><br>In the two sesson I played, almost nobody gave dice to the GM after the end of a Squad scene conflict, so he used up his dice and had to scramble to get others. Do you remember if this happened in your game too? If so, how did Nathan play to get other dice? If not, do you remberber why you gave dice to the GM?<br><br>The reason I am asking is that I see the giving of dice to the GM in these situation like something that the player must do to simply keep the game working, but has no other motivation.  Like "this is something we have no reason to do in the game but we have to do it because if we don't do it the game has problems". Something like the "we don't know why, but we will always stick together all the time" of the typical "party of adventurers" in many older rpg.<br><br>So I wanted to know if there is some in-geme reasons to gift dice to the gm that I didn't see or that I didn't understand, or if you simply had enough experience with story gaming to see at once that you had to give dice to the "adversity player" to get a better game, even if the game rules didn't gave you reasons to do that.\n<blockquote><br><b>5) Am I alone in having some problem in categorizing and differentiating the different approaches?</b>Do you mean aggressive vs. honorable vs. peaceful? I'm not entirely sure about real marked differences after that game, and I recall that Luke was a bit confused as well. Nate, are you out there? Does the game have examples of how they differ? That would probably be groovy.<br/></br></blockquote>\nYes, I am talking about honorable, peaceful, violent and subversive. The game book examples confused the hell out of me, and I don't know if the way the same action can be cathegorized in two or more of these cathegories (killing a VC prisoner under orders from the Sergeant is violent, but it's also subversive to get what you want from the sergeant) is a bug or a feature (seeing the time we lost during the game discussion the exact approach of an action, it's bug, but if we learn it's a feature we could stop discussing it at least)\n<blockquote><br><b>6) The limiting power of the approaches depends of dice scarcity.</b>This was not an issue for us either. The GM always had plenty of dice.<br/></br></blockquote>\nSee my first point above. <br><br>About the dice... do you remember how the dice moved around the players? No, I don't ask you to remember how many dice everyone had at every moment, that would be unreasonable. But you remember seeing many changes of profice forced by dice scarcity? Or having a lot of dice in the "out-of-play" pool? Or too few? <br><br>I am asking because I wanted to get the idea of what a "good" dice distribution, during the game, would be. \n<blockquote><br>The only observation I have about carry is that there's nothing in it to apportion spotlight time to different players. You can't really wait for your turn. You have to speak up and go after things, and that rewards more outspoken players.</br></blockquote>\nThis is, right there, another difference with our game. People seldom requested scenes (I think I was the only one to do so, twice)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85633/#Comment_85633" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T09:40:31+00:00" title="August  5, 2007  9:40AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Moreno<br><br>A few points I note that might help you.<br><br>3203: You, the player, pick the approach that you want and narrate it (if you think it's honourable then it's honourable -- I don't think it's up for group debate).

I had a lot of personal stuff happening; I didn't have the time to devote to playing games, let alone writing them or even writing <i>about</i> them online; and I did you a great disservice by not answering your questions promptly and as clearly as I could have. If there's anything I can do to make this up to you, up to and including refunding you for your purchase of the game, let me know - I really want to have the game stand on its own, apart from my personal failings at internet communication in the last couple of months. <br/><br/>I know that you want to hear from other people who have played the game, which is more than fair. But I feel it's incumbent upon me to talk a little about the game in response to your post, if thats ok with you.<br/><br/><strong>Publishing carry</strong><br/><br/>Here's the thing about carry...it's a short-form game. Every time I playtested it, I playtested it to the full extent of the game, through it's longest reward-cycle. Over it's development time, I had 3 games with my local group, 4.5 with groups at conventions, and 2 "blind" playtests where I wasn't present. Is that enough? Maybe. maybe not. I don't think you can put a hard number on "how many times should you playtest". But the entire game was playtested, through it's entirety, 9 times. Of course, once I decided to publish it in time for Gen Con, that became my driving goal - and let me tell you, it's a bad goal. The game suffers for it, and I suffered for it at the time. It's why I've decided to never set release dates for anything, ever. <br/><br/>However, I was confident at the time that I was happy with the game as it ran, as of the text that went to print for Gen Con. And I still am happy with it, for the most part; 90% of the game has stood up as doing exactly what I want it too when I play it. Endgame is that other 10%. And it crept up on me. I was happy with it at first, but as I've played the game more, it's begun to stand out more and more as not really working as I intended it. This is a creator issue, I suppose - I don't honestly know if it works for other groups (though, as Ron's post made clear, it was weird for him). But it doesn't work for me, which is why I'm still poking at it. And I would rather have my pokings be out in the open, where other people can try them out too. That's all.\n<blockquote>And these elegant rules with the flowing of a closed ecology of dice...  I am not sure anymore if its beauty serve the game's purpose, or not.  I don't trust very much anymore the answers of the game author (or him giving them to me) so I am asking feedback from the people who played the game.</blockquote>\nAgain, I'm just going to answer these with how they should work according to the rules. It's how they work for me in play; there may certainly be things that I do at the table that aren't in the rules. I tried really hard to get everything into the text, but I am imperfect, so, who knows?<br/><br/>Anyone, the next post has those answers.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85640/#Comment_85640" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T10:43:54+00:00" title="August  5, 2007 10:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>- 1) the choosing of the dice at the start.  It's really a little thing,  but I noticed it got the game to a bad start at the Ambercon, because the players didn't saw the reason behind the complication. It told them "too many dice complications" right at the start. OK, it would not be a problem with a less diceless-friendly group of players, but I would like to get some feedback on this. Do any of you can explain the reason for this complication?</blockquote>\nIt distributes different sized dice among the players dice pools in a way that facilitates making meaningful choices when choosing Approach; the stopping condition of having a low-Months In Grunt also means that choosing that Grunt makes all of the other Grunts more effective, as they get to choose whichever dice they want once that low dice pool is full. I know it's fiddly and weird, but it does exactly what I want it to, and I haven't found a better way to have those effects.\n<blockquote>- 2) During the Squad scenes, if the players don't gift dice to the GM, the GM is soon without dice. The players have no "game-reason" to give the GM any dice. They have to give them to him simply to have a strong opposition and don't win too easily the conflicts in the squad scenes.  Both times we played, the GM was always without dice. Nathan about this wrote "In all honesty, it's not particularly bad for the GM to be low on dice, it just tends to mean that the game tends to be more about how the characters overcome adversity than how they are divided and crushed by it.", but after playing again the game I don't agree. To overcome adversity, there should be some adversity. A guaranteed win is not adversity.<br/>And if the GM don't receive dice, the players get too many, and they don't change profiles.<br/>(by the way, the book text is wrong - and the game author agreed about it afterwards: the gifted dice are not at all like fan mail, they are given to people for tactical reasons, not to award "good play")</blockquote>\nAdversity can (and often does) come from other players. I've run games where I never got dice, and I've run games where I've never had a low dice pool, as the GM. There are mechanical stopgaps to keep the GM from going the whole game without dice, as Gregor points out. I, in all honestly, think that the dice distribution throughout the game accurately reflects the interests of the group, whether they're interested in being united or divisive, in facing strong adversity or not. <br/><br/>Also, if you have too many dice, and you want to change profile...well, start pushing conflicts and giving your dice to the GM. It's the only way to drain dice out of your   own pool.\n<blockquote>- 3) this was one of my never answered questions:<br/>3302.b)"the GM frames the scene, explaining the situation. The situation should include enough information for the Ranking Officer to be able to give orders to the other characters. After the GM frames the scene, it is divided in a series of rounds.<br/>(3302.c) Each round, the Ranking Officer gives each grunt an order, as well as giving general orders to the squad as a whole. [...]. The GM then summarize the round, and narrates the consequences of each Grunt's action<br/>(3302.d)  An action scene can take any number of rounds. It is the GM's responsibility to pace the scene though his narration, and to call the scene at an appropriate point"<br/><br/>OK, let's say I am the GM, and the Ranking Officer order Big White to kill a sniper behind a street window. I decided to pace the scene in two rounds, and this is the first.<br/>What can I tell to Big White's player? I can resolve his fight with the sniper using total GM's fiat, narrating what I want (even that he is shot and wounded by the sniper), or these are constraints? What can happen and what can't happen until the dice are rolled?</blockquote>\nThe way I run it, everything that happens in Actions scenes is obscured by a sort of "fog of war" until the dice are rolled. That is, I narrate the scene, the RO gives orders, the Grunts choose to agree/disagree and obey/disobey, and then I narrate how things change based on those narrations, from the perspective of the characters. In your example above, if Big White says "I obey, and I rip a machine gun burst through that window." then, to set up the next round, I might say "All right, you're firing through the window, and theres smoke and gunpowder pouring out of it. You can't tell if you got the sniper or not, but the rest of the attacking force are laying down suppressive fire...."<br/><br/>Once the scene is called, and we roll, then if the Squad wins I would probably say "you check it out, and you find the sniper sawed in half by machine gun fire." If the Squad lost, I might say "The smoke clears...and then there's one more shot from the sniper. By the time you get there, he's gone." <br/><br/>I tend not to narrate any actual wounding until the dice happen. It's like an action scene in a war movie - the protagonists are doing their thing, there's a lot of gunfire, shouted orders, and then when the smoke clears they realize who's been shot and who's not coming back to base. Once the points are spend on wounding Grunts and Fodder, then I'll narrate who took wounds and why. <br/><br/>The exception, of course, is if you use a Burden Die in the scene - then I have no problem narrating how you hit because of it, because whoever wins is going to have to give you fallout regardless of the dice.\n<blockquote>- 4) During the Action scenes, people can decide pretty much how many wounded or dead will be at the end, by choosing the dice to give, and to who. The GM and the ranking officer can at most add one dice, against all the dice from the players. At the end if the players don't want to be wounded, they aren't, because whoever get to decide at the end has a pityful amount of harm to give around.</blockquote>\nRight...<br/><br/>In my experience, no group has <i>ever</i> tried to balance the die pools in order to minimize harm to the squad. And if you did, that means that a significant portion of the soldiers need to disagree with the Ranking Officers orders, which provides great material for follow-up squad scenes. Also, Action Scenes are the easiest way to up your Burden die, by putting it in and thereby requiring the winner of the Action to give you fallout.<br/>\n<blockquote>- 5) Am I alone in having some problem in categorizing and differentiating the different approaches?  (many times we could have used two or three different approaches declaration, narrating the exact same action)</blockquote>\nWould it be helpful for me to try to give some more examples?\n<blockquote>- 6) The limiting power of the approaches depends of dice scarcity. If the Players have too many dice (because the GM don't have any) even the approaches seems an useless complication (this is what happended in the Ambercon game)</blockquote>\nThe approaches inform the fiction, nothing more, nothing less. If you have a bunch of dice, then you get to freely choose how you want to do things; if you don't, then you have to make choices among a subset of options. Thats all.<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85641/#Comment_85641" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T10:44:12+00:00" title="August  5, 2007 10:44AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For the Endgame, I will add a new condition.

Having other have say over your Denouement is part of the tragic arc of the game; it lets people get narrative payback for injustices done to their characters, it allows the last scene of the game to be the most dirty and harsh, which is appropriate. However, you will always have your own Epilogue, in order to gain closure. F'or example, in my game at Dex Con, Luke's character got shot in the back and paralyzed in the Denoument narration; in his Epilogue, he said that once he got back to the States he became a teacher and taught wheelchair sports to urban youth for the rest of his life. <br/><br/>In all the games I've played, nobody (except possibly Luke) has gone "no way, you can't do that to my character!" It has always been "yeh, that's totally appropriate, wow". Maybe I just tend to play with tragedy junkies.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope that some of that is helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85677/#Comment_85677" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T16:14:03+00:00" title="August  5, 2007  4:14PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great thread.

Sorry for the lateness of this answer!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>Hi Moreno<br/>A few points I note that might help you.<br/><br/>3203: You, the player, pick the approach that you want and narrate it (if you think it's honourable then it's honourable -- I don't think it's up for group debate). So you choose which one you want. If you think it could be more than one approach then just pick one way of looking at it.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, I think it would work (it would have been useful to see this issue adressed in any way in the game manual, but the way it say "each player involved decides his character' Approach" without talking about any doubt about determining the right approach can be seen as saying exactly this)\n<blockquote><br/>3205-c: If the GM has no dice the Grunts then<b>must</b>give the<b>highest die</b>in their pool to the GM (...they do get to win that conflict without rolling but at the expense of reloading the GM's pool).<br/></blockquote>\nTo avoid this, all they have to do is give even only a single die, in total, to the GM at the end of a conflict. \n<blockquote><br/>As a player it can be a better choice to give a die to the GM rather than another grunt that you may soon be conflicting with too.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, this is the only way I can see this problem can be "solved": the players have to PREFERE to give their dice to the GM instead of to the other players.<br/><br/>To do so:\n<blockquote><br/>I think the GMs dice are there to provoke conflict when the players are holding back. Mainly the GM is aggressively framing the scenes and framing conflicts between the grunts. To really get at the burdens and drive the story. </blockquote>\nFrom the varius posting I get that the objective for the master is to get the Grunts to fight (to get in conflict) with each other, so much that the players will prefere to give their dice to the GM instead.<br/><br/>(To the people who ask why the players should prefere to gift the dice between themselves, and talk about "hating the GM", I think they don't get the point.  Dice in Carry are not a "thank you, you are playing well" token like fan mail in PTA. They are a very useful, hard-to-get resource that is the ONLY thing that can allow your character to don't be pushed around by everyone, and that you MUST give to someone. It's like Fan mail only in the way if you have them you can do more things during the game, and can influence the game much more. It's like Fan mail ONLY if you DON'T give them to the GM, but share them with the other players. Giving the die to the GM instead than to another player has the same game effect in Carry as NOT giving fan mail to the other players in PTA to help the GM. Or are you saying that the GM in PTA is "more enemy" than in Carry? Mechanically, the act of don't gift the GM dice in Carry is the same as Giving Fan Mail in PTA, and the act of gifting the dice to the GM is the same as not giving fan mail.  And as in PTA, if you don't give fan mail / dice, you will not get any. Giving Dice to the GM means that you don't give them to the other players: why they should give them to you?)<br/><br/>The problem is that the game author, from what I understood, for thematic reasons, WANT to give the players a kind of playing experience where they are pushed around by everyone (or at least from the GM and the ranking grunts). <br/><br/>This is all right. I have no problem whatsoever to this thematic approach. I even find it really appropriate for the settting.<br/><br/>The problem it's that, if the players have the mechanical means to avoid it ("ruining the game"), it's means that the have to CHOOSE to avoid doing so. They have to choose to left their character to be pushed around, even if they could avoid it.<br/><br/>And this is not the same thematic experience as above. It's the difference between being drafted or being a volunteer. <br/><br/>And it's mean that there is a hole in the middle of the game, that people have to avoid stepping on.  Good, experienced story-gamers would notice it at once and avoid it easily and without even thinking about it so much, where novice players or even people who are not a good enough grasp of gaming design to notice that hole (that it's not even signaled on the gaming manual. Even a note "if you don't fight against each other the game don't work" would have been useful) risk stepping on it.<br/><br/>But that hole, it's a problem of the game. Not of the people who don't notice it.<br/><br/>About myself: I see that hole. I saw it the first time I played. I saw people stepping on it both times, and both times I couldn't really tell them "it's your fault, even if your character doesn't have any reason to do so, you should have made him enter in conflict with the other grunts, and you should have gifted more dice to the GM, even if it doesn't make any sense from the point of view of your resource management"<br/><br/>I see that hole, and I see that to avoid stepping on it, I have to play in a way that make little mechanical sense.  I am not talking about gamism. I am talking about the way an elegant system make you do what you should do because it's in your interest, not because "you have o do this or the game don't work".<br/><br/>(for an example: in Sorcerer you have to play adding narrative content to get bonus dice. So, the game reward you playing the game like it should be played. Well, think about these bonus dice in a game where they make the game don't work. The game is balanced for conflicts where nobody get them. So, in order to make the game work, you have to avoid getting the bonus dice, even if that wouldn't make any sense)<br/><br/>What if the the GM pushes the grunt against each other very aggressively? Well... you would gift dice to a GM that push you to play in the way HE want, in that manner? Only if you see that it's the only way to play. But this is the hole, again. In this way you can even justify illusionism, "if it's what it's needed to make the player play like they should play"<br/><br/>What would I have liked to see in the game? A real, concrete in game reason to gift the GM dice.  Or a different way to move the dice that avoid this problem (for example - I don't know if this could work or nor, it's only the first thing I though - when the GM is too low on dice, he could take from the dice used in a conflict before the gifting starts)<br/><br/>.<blockquote><br/>I don't know if this helps you any.</blockquote>\nIt helped me very much in organizing my thoughs and realizing what I didn't like about that rule, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86763/#Comment_86763" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T17:47:12+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  5:47PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Nathan!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hamsterprophet</cite>Hi Moreno,<br/><br/>First of all, I want to humbly apologize for my lack of communication with you over the late winter and spring. I had a lot of personal stuff happening; I didn't have the time to devote to playing games, let alone writing them or even writing<i>about</i>them online; and I did you a great disservice by not answering your questions promptly and as clearly as I could have. If there's anything I can do to make this up to you, up to and including refunding you for your purchase of the game, let me know</blockquote>\nWell, at least a "sorry, I don't have any time to answer now, but I will when I will be able to" reply to my e-mails before we demoed your game at the convention would heve been nice, I admit. But I don't want to return your game. I <b>LIKE</b> your game. I like the concept, most of the rules and even the physical book.  Even if I would have like it a bith more polished and playtested, with the problems resolved and all, and I would like for it to have a new edition with these problems addressed (I was very disappointed in learning that your new printing of the game was basically the same).<br/><br/>So, no return and no refund. But I would gladly accept a discount in the future to the updated, streamlined and fixed edition of Carry...  ;-)\n<blockquote><strong>Publishing carry</strong><br/><br/>Here's the thing about carry...it's a short-form game. Every time I playtested it, I playtested it to the full extent of the game, through it's longest reward-cycle. Over it's development time, I had 3 games with my local group, 4.5 with groups at conventions, and 2 "blind" playtests where I wasn't present. Is that enough? Maybe. maybe not. I don't think you can put a hard number on "how many times should you playtest". </blockquote>\nI don't know how many playtesting are needed for a game, I suppose it depend on the problems that the first playtesters find. Or, better, from how many blind playtest of the FINAL version (the important number, I think) don't find any real problems.<br/><br/>So, I can't really say to you how many times you should have playtested the game. I never wrote a game, I have not the direct experience. But from what you say, you had only 2 blind playtest, both with a non-definitive version of the rules.<br/><br/>It mean that I know the game better that everybody else who blind playtested it? Seeing that I played two times the final version, I alone played your game more that your entire cycle of blind playtest. In two afternoons.\n<blockquote><br/>However, I was confident at the time that I was happy with the game as it ran, as of the text that went to print for Gen Con. And I still am happy with it, for the most part; 90% of the game has stood up as doing exactly what I want it too when I play it. Endgame is that other 10%. And it crept up on me. I was happy with it at first, but as I've played the game more, it's begun to stand out more and more as not really working as I intended it. This is a creator issue, I suppose - I don't honestly know if it works for other groups (though, as Ron's post made clear, it was weird for him). But it doesn't work for me, which is why I'm still poking at it. And I would rather have my pokings be out in the open, where other people can try them out too. That's all.</blockquote>\nHow you would define your desired "working" of the Endgame?<br/><br/>From what I got from the two times I played it, the burden die is always advantageous to the character for most of the game (it can hurt you in a Action scene, but it's use is voluntary). It's never really a "burden" to the character until the endgame. Then, in the last conflict, in the original version of the endgame rules, you divide in pairs and having a bigger burden die means having a bigger chance of having a bad denouement narrated to you. (but it means having a bigger chance to be the one who narrate epilogues, too)<br/><br/>All in all, in this version having a biggen burden would seems GOOD.<br/><br/>In the new version, the one you posted in your Forge forum, having the narration of denoument or epilogue doesn't depends anymore on your burden die (seeing that there are no "pairs" anymore) but from having been chosen as a "target" by others (and getting their burden die). So, everyone who is chosen as a taget by someone narrate the denoument of that someone. And if you are the target of a lot of people with a big burden die, these people get the worse narration (in terms of the situation of their character at the end)<br/><br/>So, having a character with a big burden who hate the same person that everybody hate, get your character worse at the denoument. Having a smalled die and hating a character hated by nobody else mean having a better denouement. Everybody narrate his own epilogue.<br/><br/>Can you talk about the precise effect you are trying to reach?<br/><br/>(more)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86766/#Comment_86766" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T18:01:55+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  6:01PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hamsterprophet</cite>Also, if you have too many dice, and you want to change profile...well, start pushing conflicts and giving your dice to the GM.

Shouting, threats, pushing, physical violence and threatening with or using weapons all fall under this category. You want to come up on top".<br/><br/>Then, in the "Subversive" example, you write "setting up traps to protect the bivouac". But isn't this "using weapons"? It's not "violent", too?<br/><br/>In the "Honorable" examples there is "Enduring undeserved abuse from a superior officer".

The endgame rules should give us the order or narration and the condition we have to follow with our narration, not force us to have the last scene of our character narrated by another player.</blockquote>\nUmmm...then you'll never be happy with the Endgame, Moreno. Having other have say over your Denouement is part of the tragic arc of the game; it lets people get narrative payback for injustices done to their characters, it allows the last scene of the game to be the most dirty and harsh, which is appropriate. However, you will always have your own Epilogue, in order to gain closure. F'or example, in my game at Dex Con, Luke's character got shot in the back and paralyzed in the Denoument narration; in his Epilogue, he said that once he got back to the States he became a teacher and taught wheelchair sports to urban youth for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>In all the games I've played, nobody (except possibly Luke) has gone "no way, you can't do that to my character!" It has always been "yeh, that's totally appropriate, wow". Maybe I just tend to play with tragedy junkies.<br/><br/><br/>Are you talking about the latest version of the Endgame, posted some weeks ago at the Forge? Because in the Endgame rules in the printed book, you DON'T always get to narrate your epilogue (and this is one of the improvements of the new endgame rules)<br/><br/>Also, it seems that you take for granted that a Denouement narrated by another player will be more harsh, "cruel" and strong that one narrated by the character's player.  In my experience, it's often the other way around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113203/#Comment_113203" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T22:22:27+00:00" title="December  9, 2007 10:22PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2007 10:41PM by noclue.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Case in point:  Nathan Paoletta's<em>CARRY</em><br/><br/>This is a game that I am really interested in, a game that I wanted to play very much, a game that I played enjoying very much some<em>moments</em>of play, so much to fan my enthusiasm...  but that after looking at it (and playing it) I think it's not complete, and has so many issues that it should still be in playtesting until they are solved.</blockquote>\nOkay, so I ran a game of Carry today and I was really stoked about the game going in. The setting, the idea of soldiers working out their burdens while fighting a war, it all seemed good. I came away feeling that either I completely made a bodge job of the game or the game may indeed be half-baked. Interestingly, none of the issues you cite in this thread were a problem for us, but we had a raft of other issues at the table that lead to frustration.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>my experience with the rules is coming directly from Nate. I don't know if there might be some entropy between his head and the text, but what happened at the table went very smoothly.</blockquote>\nI'm wondering if Nate is doing things at the table that should be in the text. Either that I just suck. I must mention that this is my first time running or playing Carry, so it may well be that I completely blew it. If so, I'm hoping people here will clear me up on stuff.<br/><br/>I'm hoping the players will chime in as well when they see this post. Here's the list of issues that I came away with from our post game discussion:<br/><br/>1. Burdens. The creation of burdens and picking of the Grunts worked very well and was probably the coolest thing about the game. However, once you had your burden it really just sat there as an extra dice to roll in. Having a Burden d8 wasn't any different from a burden d6, except you were more awesome when you rolled in your burden dice and you had more profile changes. I know Burden dice play a role in deciding narration control during the endgame, but I really would have liked some effect on the fiction from changing burden dice.<br/><br/>2. Profile changes. They seemed to happen too often and not to mean much when they did. In the fiction the game emulates, for a companion character likw Charlie Sheen to suddenly go into Brawler mode would be a big deal. Its a major crisis point in the character's arc. In the game, it was just a dice refresh (part of the problem here may have been that we only had three players so dice refreshes were needed more often). The profile change refreshes the dice pool and makes certain approaches better or worse, but you know you can just change back as soon as you blow through the dice. It doesn't do anything to the character and his burdens.<br/><br/>3. Pushing. Since running out of dice leads to refreshing your dice pool, pushing's not such a big thing. Run out of dice? No problem. You'll get your profile change and refresh (we had some confusion as to what happens if you go to refresh and there's no dice in the out of play pool. I couldn't find it explicitly addressed in the text). So, it didn't feel like the dice economy was encouraging resource management in any strong way.<br/><br/>4. Burden Scenes. These scenes were some of the best scenes we had in terms of the fiction they produced and the dramatic tension that was worked out. However, since resolving a burden just led to a new burden entry and not resolving a burden led to new burden entry, the resolution didn't feel like it had weight. It didn't impact the progress towards endgame for example. It could lead to a bigger burden die, but as mentioned above, that didn't encourage character development.<br/><br/>Continued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113204/#Comment_113204" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T22:22:42+00:00" title="December  9, 2007 10:22PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5. Action Scenes. These were the most frustrating. The ranking player always gives orders, so he never gets the opportunity to agree/disagree/obey/disobey. The grunt with the lowest months-in never gets to give orders and roll the conflict dice. And in the end, winning and losing don't matter. You can narrate your character doing awesome stuff, but its just color that has no purpose. Losing by 10 points has the same effect on the PCs as winning by 10 points. So, it becomes more about gaming the dice to either prolong or speed up endgame. <br/><br/>6. Fodder. Having fodder act as hit points was one of the cool ideas that attracted me to the game. However, in execution it didn't do what I was hoping it would do for several reasons. Firstly, no on cared when fodder got killed. It was just fodder. None of the players owned any of it. None of the PCs had built any relationships with it. Secondly, their was confusion about damage. Fodder can be wounded (1 pt), shell shocked (2 pt), seriously wounded (3 pt), killed (4 pt). Basically, the only effect damaging fodder has is bringing you closer to endgame. Then it gets weird. The GM gets to decide if shell shocked and seriously wounded are mechanically identical to killed. If so, why the point differences, especially between seriously wounded and shell shocked? It also says that wounded fodder does not count towards endgame, but later it says once all the fodder are "wounded, evac'd or killed" you automatically enter endgame. Also, can you repeatedly wound the same fodder to soak up points with no mechanical effect? It doesn't seem to be additive. There doesn't seem to be a restriction on how many times you can wound a fodder character. Taken to extremes it looks like you can wound a single fodder character an infinite amount of times (except that would be complete dick).<br/><br/>7. Damaging grunts. Should have been major deal, but it basically changes burden dice size (see #4).<br/><br/>8. Structure. The scenes seemed disjointed because the squad wasn't really doing anything. There was no structure imposed on the story so that it went from a to b. It just went round in circles with the dice from one type of scene to the other. I think we all felt that we could have benefited from a structure that would carry us from scene to scene toward some goal we cared about and that would make victory in the action sequences more than just color, but something that impacted the narrative through-line. I definitely felt like there should be incentive for the PCs to strive for victory as hard as possible, to counteract the effect of the dice mechanic that encouraged balance. <br/><br/>Well. that's all I can think of at the moment. But given the fact that some people have played this game and had great experiences, I'm wondering if I just didn't get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113268/#Comment_113268" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T08:20:41+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  8:20AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in James' group.  I think he summed up our experience fairly well.  We initially had some great scenes like this one:<br/><br/>There were three of us playing, plus James who was our GM.  Our grunts were burdened with indecision due to the wrong choice getting buddies killed in the past,  being  numb to it all and starting to enjoy killing, and me who was running away from family pressures and a father who was a big shot officer in another service.  We started out in a village where we had found a Vietcong weapons cache and a bunch of scared villagers who were not talking.  So we were on the verge of a second My Lai Massacre.  Numb to the world grunt is afraid this will send him completely over the edge, indecisive grunt was struggling with what side to come down on ( I assume this wasn't vocalized but I imagine it was an internal struggle), and my grunt wanted to massacre the villagers to embarrass my father.  Numb grunt and me get into an argument which ends with him grabbing my gun and sticking it in the chest of some girl, conflict.  Does shooting this girl and starting the massacre eat me alive or do I only care about pissing off dad.  I win and we are about to have a massacre.  But, we have another conflict, indecisive grunt steps up to stop things knocking my gun away just before I fire.  The squad is whipped up into a blood lust frenzy, now fueled by numb grunt's blood lust.  I throw in with indecisive grunt and we talk the squad down.<br/><br/>This scene was full of tension, hit all of our burdens and was a lot of fun to play.  But that high was promptly deflated by the realization that win or loose the results didn't impact play.  That experience was pretty much the same for each type of conflict/scene.  We later framed the girl I almost in the first scene into a later scene as an armed VC out to kill us.  This should have been a great follow up, but at that point I simply just did not care any more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113375/#Comment_113375" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T13:56:43+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  1:56PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Will.
