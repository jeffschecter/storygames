Now being a Lt. he gained another Strength (he of course used his first up) and it looks as though he can easily rank up again next mission (70%) chance.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure how the other players feel but it seems as though having a Captain by the Second/Third session seems a bit whacked.  The missions are going to evolve drastically and rank separation will spread rather quickly.  I was looking forward to exploring the gritty mess of the missions and taking a moral pounding from your Superior Officers before accelerating too quickly but it seems as though politics and large scale operations will enter play rather soon.<br/><br/>Quite simply, am I worrying about nothing?  Have others yet to experience players quickly becoming officers while other grunts are left behind?  Is it still satisfying for everyone involved?<br/><br/>Lastly, a quick question: Do you roll for rank before or after leveling up in between Missions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165104/#Comment_165104" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T20:18:58+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  8:18PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You <i>are</i> only giving the option of ranking up to characters that used a Strength during the mission, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165108/#Comment_165108" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T20:28:26+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  8:28PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, but after your first level you can gain another strength.  With a high NFA that's 2 ranks jumped after missions.  While you have to increase a weakness before increasing Strength a second time, you are guaranteed another level up by using Orbital Bombardment once.  You could conceivably hit Captain then by the second/third session depending on how many missions/planets occur on each session.  With a high NFA you're not going to fail that demotion roll or become demoted by a Force Weakness unless you are rather unlucky.<br/><br/>This isn't <i>that</i> big of a deal but I was mildly surprised at how quickly you could rank and I'm worried about the players who started as Trooper getting miffed by their lagging behind (the Corporal of course had the most kills and the Sarge leveled up by the D10 roll).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165109/#Comment_165109" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T20:28:38+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  8:28PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2008 8:30PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the grunts don't like it, they can always drop the Force Weakness hammer and provoke demotion.<br/><br/>I haven't seen it happen yet, but I suspect things could get quite bitter at that point.<br/><br/>(cross-posted, but I would add that with a 3-4 FA you are less likely to level and gain strengths to promote)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165114/#Comment_165114" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T20:36:52+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  8:36PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>If the grunts don't like it, they can always drop the Force Weakness hammer and provoke demotion.<br/><br/>I haven't seen it happen yet, but I suspect things could get quite bitter at that point.<br/></blockquote>\nYou can always accidentally kill your Captain and set yourself up for field promotion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165115/#Comment_165115" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T20:39:19+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  8:39PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But if you went with a really high NFA then while you'll make the development check to rank up, you're not going to be getting high amounts of kills and you're probably not getting the levels you need to keep the Flashbacks coming.

But someone with a high NFA won't likely fail the demotion roll and they will gain another stat as well as Flashback for the level up.  My main concern is the two Troopers in my group because they see the Corporal totally obliterating the aliens -Corporal is a stud with a good NFA and decent FA which occurred because he tied the Sarge with NFA to start, and the Sarge ranking up quickly with new toys and they have nothing.  One player who gave himself a high FA to start leveled some complaints on the Corporal receiving the E-Cannon because the kills are so skewed.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem was the two players who ended up Troopers were not previously part of my regular group and one is very much a Gamist, in which him remaining on the bottom of the totem pole is irking him.<br/><br/>I had a blast though and am utterly depressed that I have to wait another week to play our second session.<br/><br/>I think all of the meaningful chat overshadowed that question at the bottom of my post; does anyone know if you receive the level before or after you make your roll to acquire new gear/rank/etc.?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165347/#Comment_165347" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T12:01:11+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:01PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The order from the book is strictly...<br/><br/>Gain Level<br/>Gain Automatic Improvement<br/>Make a Development Roll<br/>Test for Demotion<br/><br/>As for the grunts...they're getting their free improvements after every mission for their <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">grenades</span> weapons right?

I can bug out of the next encounter too, or let my PC die rather than use a Strength to save him. Then I'd dice off with the other Trooper for the field promotion. Ouch. It depends on the dice, really. A high FA means you'll probably kill, but it doesn't say whether you get killed doing so, the dice rolls decide that.<br/><br/>(Oh, and you all get to Level in the end if you play the campaign long enough.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165361/#Comment_165361" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T12:27:21+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:27PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>My main concern is the two Troopers in my group because they see the Corporal totally obliterating the aliens -Corporal is a stud with a good NFA and decent FA which occurred because he tied the Sarge with NFA to start, and the Sarge ranking up quickly with new toys and they have nothing.  One player who gave himself a high FA to start leveled some complaints on the Corporal receiving the E-Cannon because the kills are so skewed.</blockquote>Another easy solution:  shoot the Corporal in the back and take the E-Cannon.  <br/><br/>I haven't played the game yet, but I have the feeling, if the group enjoys that kind of play, this game would work best with a lot of rivalry/outright hatred between squad members.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165368/#Comment_165368" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T12:35:33+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:35PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your troopers let their officer wind up with both a high FA and high NFA...then screw 'em...they let it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're players are getting irked that someone else is getting all the cool prizes...um...good...the game is designed to illicit that response.  They have the power to change things quite easily, so if they remain on the bottom of the totem pole its by their own choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no one more in trouble than an annoying high ranking officer with all the cool toys a high NFA and a middling FA.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting that asshole killed is beyond easy...its almost trivially easy.  If you're going to shoot for high rank in 3:16...for real...in a campaign...with players who mean it...you should be jacking up your FA not your NFA.  Cuz if your FA ain't up to snuff you'll go down the hard way.  That alone should slow down your rank advancements greatly because you won't have the high NFA to level up regularly and you'll be vulnerable to demotion.  But being vulnerable to demotion is better than being vulnerable to being whacked<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like your players haven't figured out that whacking their low FA superior officer (directly or indirectly) is the Brigadier-given right...nay duty...of every good and loyal trooper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165387/#Comment_165387" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T13:09:14+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  1:09PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, besides... everybody knows officers don't know jack of what means to be a real soldier on the field, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
