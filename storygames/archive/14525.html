Not just a Weird thing, but also a weird one. It's one place where the temptation to get all cutesy and Lost-ey on your players can trip you up a bit, the other being the nature of the apocalypse. <br/><br/>So you're MCing and you want a cool maelstrom, yeah? One like that one you read about on the forums where it was the displaced, embodied love of humanity or whatever? <br/><br/>But how cute is too cute? Is a more simple and direct maelstrom more evocative? Or does a more comlex maelstrom give your players more to dig in with? <br/><br/>I'm looking at examples from play as well as more general theoretical thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330871/#Comment_330871" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T15:26:19+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  3:26PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd only note that it can depend on how generic you're AW setting is.<br/><br/>Like, i'm in an game right now that's running solid and is totally awesome.  We're exploring the Maelstrom, and it's got it's own flavor, sure, but the fact that we're all in a "low orbit setting," (on space stations, satellites and stuff) makes the Maelstrom just one part of the whole.  The first time i played AW the Maelstrom/Apocalypse was already semi-lined out before we played, and if the game had continued i would have wanted more details/complexity from it.  But for our Space Game i'm cool with it being, kinda, whatever, i guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330873/#Comment_330873" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T15:34:48+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  3:34PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I riff off of the successes and failures of maelstrom-related moves and how the players answered my questions when they were doing maelstrom-related stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330879/#Comment_330879" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T16:19:22+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  4:19PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2011 4:21PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, what Judd said.<br/><br/>Like everything else in an AW game, the maelstrom is strongly owned by the MC, and its details arise from the conversation between the players. Especially the answer to the first maelstrom questions, like, "What's it like for you when you open your brain?" and "How do you do that?"<br/><br/>So I think there could be a temptation for the MC to get all cute with it, sure, but the process of having the conversation roots it back in the fictional events and the whole input of the group, rather than just one person's secret pet project.<br/><br/>This also touches on the way the Apocalypse World MC does prep and has ownership over the setting, but doesn't plan out what will happen in advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330889/#Comment_330889" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T17:29:34+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  5:29PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you clarify what you mean by "cute"?

And then, based on what the characters do, how they answer questions, what happens when they use augury and open their brains, I build that towards something more solid, gradually.<br/><br/>The first time I ran the game, I made the Maelstrom "aggressively helpful," trying to show the players where all the trouble and weapons were, rooting for them to get stuck in, etc.  I have no idea where that was going, but it was fun and would have ended up some place crazy.  My current game started out with the Maelstrom being "introspective and nihilistic," but then, over time, that turned into a bunch of ghostly echoes that drive people to madness and violent cannibalism.  I had no idea it would work out that way when we started!<br/><br/>Next time, I'm thinking about giving the Maelstrom a more specific objective.  Maybe it wants everyone to have babies or wants all the characters to go to a specific place or something.  And then, over the course of the game, we can all figure out, collectively, why the Maelstrom wants that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330912/#Comment_330912" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T21:52:00+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  9:52PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2011 9:53PM by stefoid.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A military virus for telepathy got out of the lab and everyone became telepathic.

"Cuteness" is certainly in the eye of the beholder, but I will bust on Greg Stolze's setting for Reign. In case you haven't seen it, the whole thing takes place on these two giant dead bodies or something or maybe the continent is shaped like that. And they're lovers, see? And the sun, it doesn't move, it just turns on and off everyday. And it's all very poignant, or something.<br/><br/>Except it's got fuck-all to do with the game or anything. It's just weird for the sake of its own weirdness. There's all this weirdness, but it has nothing to do with the character's stories at all. To me, it's the effort to push creativity to the extreme for the sole purpose of being original. It's wankery. <br/><br/>It's a fine line in a game and one that's different for everyone. The maelstrom from the maelstrom thread were everyone was just different expressions of the same person's internal thoughts crosses the line with me. The space station game approaches it, but doesn't cross the line with me.<br/><br/>Thing is, I've never played in an AW game in a Mad Max wasteland with a maelstrom caused by the psychic suffering of the apocalypse. All of them, MY OWN INCLUDED, have been these high-concept complex settings and maelstroms. And these have never really mattered to the personal stories of the characters. The game is about their struggles for survival and stable, healthy relationships. And meanwhile, I'm all like "HEY, LOOK AT MY MAELSTROM. IT'S THE DYING THOUGHT OF THE WORLD'S LAST WHALE!!!!"<br/><br/>EDIT: meh                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331309/#Comment_331309" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-23T09:13:16+00:00" title="June 23, 2011  9:13AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I MC a game again, I think I'll have definition of the Maelstrom be part of the initital "what kind of Apocalypse should we play" discussion.

The vagueness of the Maelstrom is a part of this I think. Yes, depending on the MC's interpretation the Maelstrom, it might not be tied very closely to the characters story. But IMHO it's a nice gratuitous degree of liberty. For some players (like me) it brings a level of esoteric exploration, some breathing space inside a focused design.

Sure, I ask all those questions like "how do you open your brain" and ask the Brainers and the Hocuses and the Savvyheads some key questions about their past interactions with the thing, but in the end that gives me colour and isolated occurrences, not concepts or reasons or themes or underlying mechanics. To my mind, revelation of the overarching concepts - what makes the maelstrom tick - is something reserved for the 12+ rolls, later.<br/><br/>But I'm also afraid of leaving things too undefined and fluid up until we reach that point. First, I'm still on the hook for describing what the maelstrom does to you when you Open Your Brain, and the fallout if you miss. It helps me if I have some idea of what makes the maelstrom tick, and what its motivations are, if any. Second, I want the players upon making that 12+ roll to have some consistency to latch onto when they make their observations and receive their insight. If the maelstrom has manifested as ghost-like shapes in the woods as well as intelligent machines and microbial infections, that'll make it pretty darn difficult to come up with what the damn thing is when play starts to revolve more around it, the nature of the Apocalypse, and how to fix the world.<br/><br/>This leads me down a path where I flesh out the maelstrom and its underlying raison d'etre more and more as the game goes on. The fiction will be more defined and constrained as a result. The issue then is that I start making pretty important decisions about the overall themes of the game on the players' behalf, and those 12+ rolls that'll eventually come up will be less of the players taking control of their destiny and more of me finally revealing all my closely-held cards in glee to the players, stupidly expecting them to gasp in amazement at the dying thought of the world's last whale or whatever bullshit I've cooked up that they really couldn't care less about.<br/><br/>One solution would be, as Joe sez above, front-load the nature of the maelstrom and Apocalyptic event at the game's first session. But this seems to similarly contradict the idea of discovery through play - now, instead of the MC authoring it all, the players (or more likely, some players) author it. Since the nature is now known and defined, play is more rigid and the discovery much less exciting.<br/><br/>I'd like to see a happy medium, where the maelstrom can be fluidly defined and described, until the players start authoring its exact nature through the mechanics. The nature of the maelstrom plays a big part in the MC's ability to do this, I think - if you've decided, through group collaboration or by secret prep, that the maelstrom is an alien super-AI with mind-controlling orbital lasers, then a number of parameters regarding the colour, its mode of interaction, and its motivations are already pretty rigidly defined. You've established some narrativist themes based on this maelstrom nature and if the play goes elsewhere to address other themes, it does so without - or in conflict with - the maelstrom and its themes.<br/><br/>My best success so far, as outlined in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=330860" rel="nofollow">Your Psychic Maelstroms?</a> thread, is with:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>...a manifestation of nature taking back human intelligence. Every hostile facet of nature - the mutated, poisonous indigenous lifeforms, the vegetation, the foods, drinks and drugs derived from them, the bacteria and viruses, the rain and storms - are trying to rip sentience and free will from the remaining inhabitants, leaving them as idiot human husks, savages, and bottom feeders. The player characters and a handful of key NPCs are the only ones relatively unafflicted by the maelstrom, which is why their motivations are a tad bit more complex than "where can I get my next drink" and "who do I have to kill next to get what I want". When you "open your mind" and hit, you get to commune with the icy cold remnants of that compounded lost intellect. When you fail, I ask you questions about your mental activity, and when you wake up those answers have been lost to you.</blockquote>\nWhat I like about this is that while I've introduced a series of overall themes - namely "Civilization vs Nature", "Human Worth", etc - I've left the manifestations very open-ended, letting anything to do with the natural world potentially be a manifestation of the maelstrom. I've also tied it in with some of the game's conceits, like NPCs with simple motivations, mob mentalities, a hostile environment, the maelstrom's potential to be both useful and detrimental, and the ties between the maelstrom and the apocalyptic event. I think I can milk this for quite a few sessions before making things too rigidly defined.<br/><br/>However, I'd be interested in knowing what <i>parameters</i> a good maelstrom has which allows for this kind of play, perhaps some example ones that fit the bill, and what techniques could be utilized to arrive at one through play rather than MC front-loading or prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher" title="Christopher"><img alt="Christopher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher">Christopher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331541/#Comment_331541" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T20:54:34+00:00" title="June 24, 2011  8:54PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it's cause I'm piss drunk, but that was a good post, Mikael.<br/><br/>As far as parameters, as long as the maelstrom is player focused, i think it's cool.<br/><br/>That's sort of what Harper is saying about the maelstrom being strongly effected by MC&gt;player questions, yeah? If their characters are dialed in, then it's gravy, complexity or no. But if your maelstrom is this thing that doesn't really tell us anything about the PCs, then fuck it, right?<br/><br/>Because I feel what Franck is saying. It should be open enough to be a reflective surface for the player characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331610/#Comment_331610" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T16:24:01+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  4:24PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your Maelstrom should be a Threat or part of a Front. Consequently, it should be based on some sort of scarcity, a basis that it shares with numerous other things in the world that the PCs are dealing with. If all these things are true, and the Maelstrom clearly expresses that scarcity, or is clearly part of that Front, or clearly manifests its particular Threat type, then it cannot help but avoid the pitfalls Christopher describes.<br/><br/>It may still be a tiny glass world living on the back of a dozing dragon or whatever -- but if you apply the same principles to it as you apply to everything else you're making up in the fiction, then that tiny glass world is going to matter to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
