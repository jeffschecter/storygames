We're talking about his needs as a gamer and why it doesn't pan out to play games with mechanics, and it develops that he's feeling a barrier over the creation of NPC stats - deciding on the fly what they're capable of, allowing for current and future developments, difficulties that match the PCs, etc.<br/><br/>I crunch some numbers and come up with a beer and pretzels thing.  Four stats, a handful of Aspects from SOTC, a sexy resolution mechanic that borrows spiritually from Dogs in the Vineyard.  Task resolution is handled entirely by PC stats.  Heavily narrative but should be mechanically sound.<br/><br/>So I ask you: is this made of win?  Can anyone spot anything broken, anything that I've missed, numbers that don't add up?<br/><br/><a href="http://www.pastebin.ca/1452121" rel="nofollow">http://www.pastebin.ca/1452121</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211181/#Comment_211181" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T15:45:45+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  3:45PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay!

But it would be easy enough to roll opposing pools, count up successes, and have the same dynamic going.  Either party has the option of stopping the conflict, either by surrendering or by simply backing off, and if they get to the final mark the incap goes to the one with fewer successes (with recurring tiebreakers until you get a winner, as necessary).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211583/#Comment_211583" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T06:20:19+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  6:20AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool. I like the idea that all the GM ever has to do, mechanically, is come up with difficulty numbers. Seems perfect for your situation, where the GM isn't into a lot of interacting with game mechanics. <br/><br/>How would you handle a situation where you wanted to really "zoom in" on the action, like the final, climactic duel between your character and his archenemy? Would you, the player, just set smaller stakes for your conflicts -- i.e., "I try to draw my blade first to force him into a defensive position" rather than "I kill him" -- or would you just tell the GM "OK, let's take our time with this one" and freeform most of the combat before finally going to dice?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
