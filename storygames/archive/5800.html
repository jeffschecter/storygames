I think its sensible to choose a game based on what works well for you and players you want to game with.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nHonestly, part of me thinks that this <i>need</i> to assemble people of like mind and then find a rule set that suits them in order to facilitate prolonged gameplay might be a failing of RPGs, rather than a benefit. People talk a lot about 'pick up and play RPGs' and, indeed, some people are totally concinced that they have created them. I'm not.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the beauties of games like Clue or Monopoly is that they provide a very focused, very static, play experience. When somebody says "Let's play Clue!" you always know exactly what to expect. When somebody says "Let's play D&amp;D;!" the actual play experience has very little to do with the rules and nearly everything to do with how the people doing the playing decide to apply them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules of a game like Clue are very focused on providing one and only one type of actual play exeprience, while the rules of RPGs are (with very few exceptions) largely elaborate variations on simple pass/fail mechanics, rather than procedural rules that govern the flow of actual game play. How the rules are applied in most boardgames is spelled out in absolutes, while how rules are applied in RPGs is largely left up to the best judgement of a single individual (e.g. the DM) or group concensus (in those 'dirty hippy' games).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefit of such open interpretation of rules with regard to their application is that it makes more play modes possible. When you buy a RPG, you aren't typically restricted to telling one single story or exploring one single theme. That's good. The downside is that there is no default set of expectations about what actual play will consist of (as the thousands of threads here and elsewhere dedicated to arguing about right and wrong ways to roleplay can attest to). I think that's bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, obviously, there have been some RPG games that try to consolidate the tight, focused, play of a boardgame and the basic principles of a RPG -- I don't think there are very many of them, though. At the time of this posting, only <i>The Mountain Witch</i> comes immediately to mind. I was initially tempted to say that several indie games aim for this, though I'm not entirely sure that they do. Like Clue, games of The Mountain Witch will <i>always</i> be about Samurai hired to kill O-Yanma -- the portrayal of characters will change depending upon who is doing the portraying, of course, and the actual end game may change (I recently recall a thread about a TPK in The Mountain Witch) but a game of The Mountain Witch will <i>always</i> be about Samurai hired to kill O-Yanma.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd right about here, I'm going to start rambling because I'm not quite sure where this is going yet. I know that I have something I want to discuss here but I'm having some trouble articulating it (Don't do drugs, kids!) -- I'll get back to it when I have a chance to let it brew a bit longer. In the meantime, feel free to discuss (or ridicule) what I've written so far.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129872/#Comment_129872" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T18:18:43+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  6:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was trying to get at this idea (in a very clumsy way) with my Justifers in the Vineyard thread.<br><br>I haven't played The Mountain Witch, so maybe I'm way off base, but <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> seems very much in the same vein.  The players play Dogs who go into a town and root out the Sins that are causing all the Injustice while Supernatural Forces oppose them.  That's very structured.  Dogs is <i>always</i> about Dogs who go into a town and root out the Sins that are causing all the Injustice.<br><br>I really like that idea, and the game I'm working on (<i>a murder of crows</i>) is designed the same way, with a predefined character type and a predefined generic scenario-for-adventure, with a lot of advice and mechanics to help a GM keep writing that adventure.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
