Her traits and tags seem like they'll come up a lot and be useful in plenty of Lady Blackbird-ish situations, and her Keys tie her into the setting a bit, with a relationship with Vance. Plus the sky squid thing is cool.<br/><br/><b>Deangelo</b> seems like a problem as a character. Points for a clockwork doctor, but his traits and tags seem very focused; like he'd be only useful in figuring stuff out. <br/><br/>His doctor skills probably won't come up much, since the nature of the game mechanics mean that the other PCs don't really need "healing" like they might in some games. And his Secret that lets him use random things as deadly weapons a) doesn't seem in keeping with his "wise doctor" shtick, and b) may not be that useful, since none of his traits and tags can be used for fighting.<br/><br/>Also, unlike Maeve, his Keys don't tie him to any of the existing characters.<br/><br/>Maybe he'd work better if he was part of Lady Blackbird's entourage, and had a couple extra skillsets, like interfacing directly with Empire hardware (a la R2D2), or mimicking and decrypting Empire codes and signals.<br/><br/>Just some thoughts; it's a flexible enough game that the character would probably be fine in the hands of a clever player.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leprenomichaun" title="Leprenomichaun"><img alt="Leprenomichaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leprenomichaun">Leprenomichaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415499/#Comment_415499" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T21:57:41+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  9:57PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>AMBayard:</b> Hm, I didn't check too hard to see if I was stepping on other characters' toes, just sort of picked ones that I thought were applicable to the characters as I envisioned them.

Good point about Deangelo, with LB characters don't really need doctors. I like your thoughts about changes to his skillset, and tying him to Lady Blackbird instead of the Owl seems like a good idea. I will mess around with him a bit and see what I come up with. <br/><br/>Regarding the throwing Secret, I can't even remember why I chose that one to be honest. I think I envisioned him using his Clockwork Body trait and tags like Precise Movement and Torque to use it.
