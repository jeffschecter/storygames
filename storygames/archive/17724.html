You start the game with just one (c\u2019mon, you\u2019re a Minion).<br/><br/>We had:<br/><br/>1. Mastermind Cyborg Jesus / Minion Fred the Frog<br/>2. Mastermind Sephina / Minion Steve the Stick-Figure Man<br/>3. Mastermind K. Kreiger / Minion Ms. Fortune<br/>4. Mastermind Lord Gold / Minion Viral<br/><br/>On your sheet you have three \u201cNemesis\u201d slots, corresponding to the three rounds of the game, and you fill each of these in with another Mastermind (the first on your right, second on your right, etc.)<br/><br/>Then we each fill out three Project cards, which have a word or phrase on them. (i.e., Assassination, Vegas 2, Moon Prison, Confetti, Old Ladies, etc.). Everyone\u2019s Project cards are shuffled together.<br/><br/>You play the game in turns. Cyborg Jesus (that was *sunglasses* me) took the first turn, and we went in the order above. Every Round, everyone takes a turn. The game ends after three rounds.<br/><br/>On my turn, I flip over a Project card, and have to use this to describe the next step of my plan to take over the world. I have to use one of my Qualities. So it looks like this:<br/><br/>Draws <b>Teen Idol</b> Project card.<br/><br/>\u201cI, Cyborg Jesus, using my <b>Nuns With Guns</b>, am going to have those Nuns infiltrate every boy band in the world and learn how to mimic their movements and mannerisms. Eventually, they\u2019ll all activate and take over every teen idol at once, giving me power over the minds of every mushy-headed adolescent in the world!\u201d<br/><br/>What we\u2019re really doing, then, is taking two pieces of seed content and a basic situation (Quality + Project card + \u201cI am trying to take over the world\u201d), and using those to extemporaneously narrate some cool and crazy shit happening. There was one player in particular who kind of had trouble with this; there were a few times where he had difficulty taking the pieces and making something of them. I didn\u2019t ask him exactly where his trouble was, so I won\u2019t speculate. However, I noticed that there were times when other folks at the table had to take more than a moment to really come up with something. I didn\u2019t have a problem, but I have (years) more experience with these games than the folks who had trouble.<br/><br/>\u201cIf you help me, Minions, I will give you a platinum microphone that will allow you to command anyone to do what you want.\u201d<br/><br/>After I narrate what I\u2019m doing, I have to offer a Toolbelt Item to the Minions (everyone who is not my Nemesis this round plays their Minion) that they\u2019ll get if they help me and I win. This is just something I make up on the spot. Usually it ends up being related to the plan.<br/><br/>Then, my Nemesis uses a Quality of their own (\u201cLord Gold, using his Quality <b>President of the United States</b>, is going to pass legislation outlawing boy bands. I\u2019ll offer the Minions an Experimental Prototype Giant Robot if they help me.\u201d) to say how they\u2019re stopping my plan, and offers the Minions a Toolbelt Item of their own.<br/><br/>The Minions vote, throwing a token down for who they\u2019re voting for, and saying how they\u2019re helping that Mastermind or Nemesis using one of their Toolbelt Items.<br/><br/>Then the Mastermind and Nemesis both roll 4 Fudge dice, adding +1 for each token in their favor.<br/><br/>Whoever wins, wins, their plan going off and their Minions getting the offered Toolbelt Item.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re the Mastermind and you win, you write down whatever was on that Project card as the next step in your Project (Hence \u201cProject Ninja Panda Taco\u201d\u2014three Rounds, three possible Projects to win). If you win as the Nemesis, you take that card, but don\u2019t write it down as a Project. It\u2019ll count later for scoring.<br/><br/>We had a crazy game full of Russian grandmas putting the world to sleep with magical borscht, an empire of porn lulling the masses to placated pleasure (also a 24k gold dildo), the vacation city for the world lifted into the sky, and at least three fighting tournaments, one of which was on the moon.<br/><br/>So in a lot of ways this is a very easy game to play. I\u2019ve almost entirely described all of the rules here. The only other thing is the scoring at the end--whoever had the most points (Project cards won, Projects thwarted, Qualities still in play, etc.) wins. The Minion who has the most Toolbelt Item graduates to Mastermind.<br/><br/>It leaves notions of character and story very loose, letting the players fill that stuff in if they want, or not. Like, I was Cyborg Jesus, but wasn\u2019t ever thinking or talking about where Cyborg Jesus was at any given moment, or even much of what he was doing. Play was on a higher level (with regard to detail), and me saying my plan necessarily includes a Quality, so my Mastermind *is* doing something\u2014I suppose I\u2019m trying to say that play paints with a broad brush, and we don\u2019t get down into fiddly moment-by-moment details of how this plan is happening. You just make stuff up and justify it, which suits the comedic tone of the game really well.<br/><br/>It also plays super fast. Our game was an hour and a half with four players, and that was with doing all the setup and describing the rules and looking up what happened with ties, etc. (If you tie, the Mastermind can cross off a Quality, never being able to use it again, and losing points in endgame, to win the Project card). I think this game probably gets better with more players, to a certain point. Five or six players, at a party, would be a great way to play PNPT, I think. We didn\u2019t have a lot of wheelin\u2019 &amp; dealin\u2019 for the votes of the Minions, but I can also imagine that being a big part of play with certain groups. Apples to Apples has been an amazing game with certain groups\u2014we\u2019re all reading each other, making justifications for our cards, testing our debate skills and our friend-knowledge skills. That is the real game in this game, I think.<br/><br/>Give it a try! It\u2019s fun! This\u2019ll be a good go-to for friends who just enjoy being silly, \u201cgamers\u201d or not.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hannah" title="Hannah"><img alt="Hannah" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hannah">Hannah</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401355/#Comment_401355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T17:00:47+00:00" title="December 20, 2012  5:00PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like so much fun!
