It's a game designed for people with busy schedules. It attempts to allow you to play a fun roleplaying-like game with no preparation time required. There's no game master, so nobody has the added burden of coming up with a story on their own, and there are no exclusive characters (i.e. PCs exclusive to a player) and no character sheets.</p>\n<p>I'd be overjoyed if you'd read our game or even give it a try.  Please let me know what you think of it.</p>\n<p>You can download Muse in PDF or ePub format at the <a href="http://www.benn.ca/muse/" rel="nofollow">official website</a>.</p>\n<p>Here's a little blurb about the game:</p>\n<p>Muse is a storytelling game where players collaborate and compete with each other to tell an enjoyable<br/>\nstory. Players will take turns, with each of them contributing to a single story. Play will<br/>\npass from player to player in clockwise order, unless listeners jump in or object. Players will inspire<br/>\neach other to create story elements, which will get combined into questions about the plot.<br/>\nNo-one knows in advance how questions will finally be answered. The game ends when no more<br/>\nquestions can be created and the last question in play has been answered. The player with the<br/>\nbest hand remaining gets to narrate the story\u2019s epilogue.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>--Jonathan</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123854/#Comment_123854" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T16:54:18+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  4:54PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, so, I like this a lot.

I haven't even played this version.<br/><br/>That said, the last version was a lot of fun!<br/><br/>Jon and I started working on this together over a year and a half ago. We've played a bunch of different variants, with a bunch of different people, and a lot of good things have come out of this concept. The latest version, which you're seeing, though, is Jon's beast. We live in different cities now, and I haven't had any hand in writing or playtesting this particular version.<br/><br/>He's changed a couple of things I don't like, and a couple of things I really like as well, so I'm just as curious as you to see how it fares in its current form.<br/><br/>I can answer your questions, though:<br/><br/>--I don't think incentivizing "good additions" is necessary at all. In past versions, there was never even any advice given, and I don't remember seeing a single addition by a single player that didn't work out well in playtests.<br/><br/>--How did this game come about? As a result of a conversation between Jon and myself. Jon, do you want to share, or do you mind if I do?<br/><br/>Thanks for the positive response!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123907/#Comment_123907" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T06:18:21+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  6:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sell me on this!

I'd say we've had about a half-dozen serious playtests of Muse and Muse-like variants.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what inspired us... lots of things.  I used to GM most of the time for my group of RPG players, but as an adult with a full-time job and a busy schedule I didn't really have the time for it anymore.  This inspired me to create a new game that required no preparation on the part of the GM or the players--but that could somehow still reliably generate fun stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul and I started reading every storytelling game we could get our hands on.  We started playtesting some ideas.  I'd say that my main influences have been Baron Munchausen and 1001 Nights.  The Questions were Paul's invention and they got inspired from Cape as far as I know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\n--Jonathan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124000/#Comment_124000" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T17:48:28+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  5:48PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert-<br><br>There's no "in-fiction vibe".

You can have all the main characters die in a terrible tragedy, for example. You can have only one main character, which opens up a whole range of new story genres that are hard to explore in RPGs (where you generally expect a party size of 4 or 5 people).</li>\n<li>Muse really helps spark and focus your creativity.

One brave dwarf learns of an evil cult of blood-drinkers that are out to exterminate the dwarves. He invades their citadel and tries to steal their greatest artifacts...</li>\n<li> In Cold War East Berlin, evil wizards summon up an army of undead to aid them in their world conquest, while a former collaborator tries to defect to the West.</li>\n<li> A superhero with the dubious power that he can fly--but only if no-one is looking at him--fights to save New York City from an evil alien computer and a vodoo priest. Is it a bird?  Is it a plane?  Whatever it is, it's falling...</li>\n<li> The latest seasons of Dr. Who tell us that the Time War destroyed the Time Lords' home planet of Galifrey, and (most) of the Daleks. How did this happen?

However, first let me say that I'm totally new to the whole story game thing and I come from a traditionalist D&amp;Dish background (not even because my friends and I have always played homebrew games, based on D&amp;D, but not D&amp;D).  Also, I have not actually played any story games, having no one nearby who I know that is into this kind of thing, unfortunately.   So therefore I have not had the chance to play your game.   Also, I will add that I am not 100% sure I understood all of the nuances by reading the rules and think it would take a game or two for me to formulate a truly effective opinion.   <br/><br/>That said, I must say I find this intriguing.  I think this would provide an interesting mechanism for story development for intra-campaign scenarios, as you mentioned.   That's how I would see using this.   In this case I think the stakes for the Players would be rather high, and therefore the energy of the Muse session would be high, since the Players would undoubtedly have issues related to their Characters at stake.   So the stories would relate to past and future campaigns.   I think that's an awesome idea, and an interesting way to pull it off.   <br/><br/>I like the poker aspect, though I must admit I also see possibilities for using dice with similar effects.   The issues is that the Players be able to gamble on something to take control of the story that means something to them (in this case their Characters in my world).   All in all, I give this high marks for being a creative story development system.   As far as how it would play out as a game in its own right, it's a little hard to visualize for me, but with the right group of creative minds I think it could be quite fun.<br/><br/>I'll keep it around and the next time I get a chance I'll try it with whomever I can.   It would be great to have a two-person option on this game I totally agree.   If I can contrive one (possibly using dice) I'll let you know.   I certainly wouldn't have a problem recommending it to other GMs who might use my Elthos RPG in the future if you didn't object.   It would be something like, "and for an interesting intra-campaign story development system you might try out Muse" or some such.   Anyway, thanks.   Very cool.<br/><br/>Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124438/#Comment_124438" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T20:23:21+00:00" title="February  4, 2008  8:23PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/><br/>We used dice up until the last two revisions of the rules.

Basically, your hand will be made up of dice instead of cards.  In a showdown, whenever you'd reveal a card you instead roll a die from your hand.  Whoever has the die with the highest face value wins.  If the players are tied for highest face value, then they set aside that die, and consider the next highest face value.  If one player runs out of dice in this way then they lose.  In the case of a complete tie, the players reroll all their dice.<br/><br/>e.g. with d100<br/><br/>Alice rolls: 99, 50, 30<br/>Bob rolls: 75, 63, 40, 11<br/>Alice wins (her 99 is the highest face value)<br/><br/>Alice rolls: 30, 10, 3<br/>Bob rolls: 30, 5<br/>Alice wins (they're tied with the 30s, but Alice's 10 beats Bob's 5)<br/><br/>Alice rolls: 30, 10, 3<br/>Bob rolls: 30, 10<br/>Alice wins (she and Bob are perfectly tied for the 30 and the 10, but she has an extra die)<br/><br/>Alice rolls: 65, 49, 36<br/>Bob rolls: 65, 49, 36<br/>Tie (re-roll)<br/><br/><br/>I hope that answers your question!<br/><br/>--Jonathan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128598/#Comment_128598" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:00:53+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:00AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For anyone planning to play this game, a house rule I would use:<br/><br/>--When "turning the tides", you may only add cards that match either the value or the suit of a card already on the table (and on your side of the Question).<br/><br/>(Jon will probably disagree with this, but there it is.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kadu" title="kadu"><img alt="kadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.polter.pl/images/avatars/96228095746cad49603e6b.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kadu">kadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134281/#Comment_134281" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T04:08:08+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  4:08AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi,<br/><br/>I've read the game and it looks quite nice. I didn't like the way Universalis handles conflicts (with tons of dice) and the poker hand system seems more attractive to me. So, maybe I'll give this game a try between my usual game sessions, to see how it works. The one change to the rules I'd make would be the Epilogue. If I get it right only one person does the epilogue, and then the session finishes. I've just read The Comitee for the Exploration od Mysteries and it makes the epilogue work like that:<br/><br/>1. the winner (in this case thad would be the best hand owner) narrates the epilogue<br/>2. the next best hand owner narrataes something, but cannot negate or change the meaning of what was said by the winner<br/>3. and so on, to the worst hand owner.<br/><br/>So, everybody has his own part of it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Demiurge</cite>Sell me on this!
