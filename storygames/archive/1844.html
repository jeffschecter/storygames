I'd love you to spill the beans on this, cause I've heard jack since its release.  You don't have to go into a 2-page total description, just one or a few select sentences about the experience would help me out here. Pretty please.

                            Woah one Andy K is calling out another Andy K! Show down! <br/><br/>Actually I've been meaning to make a post about this game, and the wider problem I have with historical games, but this thread will do.<br/><br/>The game was a few weeks back at a convention, the GM was fairly experienced with Heroquest and obviously quite passionate about the time period. This proved to be the downfall of the game. I'll just add that my problem was not with The Game itself, per se, but with the game we played, so take it with a pinch of salt. <br/><br/>Hope it doesnt come across as a whinge, but I think it might be symptomatic of a problem with many historical games - too much history!<br/><br/>The GM spent half an hour describing the intricacies of HeroQuest, before breaking down every painstaking historical detail and context about 13th century Lithuania for another half an hour. An hour down, and we only just began.<br/><br/>The characters were all interesting. We were all nobles dispatched to broker a peace on the borders between the pagan lord and his teutonic order neighbours. Good setup, ripe for conflict.<br/><br/>Except everytime someone asked a question about the game or suggested doing something, it was accompanied with about 10 minutes of historical detail and context ("obviously this is all in vain as in 50 years time so and so invades ..." or "well you know that what really <b>happened </b>was ..."). Needless to say this got tiresome, and this coming from me, an ancient history graduate! <br/><br/>This came to a head later in the adventure when one of the other players, who was clearly digging the detail and the period, announced that because of the historical context of the adventure, "even though it would be 50 years too early", he was going to try and ride to Poland to get the king to come and save the day. The rest of us just rolled our eyes as this prompted a wave of "well this could happen early if this or that happened, but in reality blah blah blah."<br/><br/>Finally, because it was late, the adventure wrapped up really unsatisfactorally with one of the players doing something I hadn't realised anyone could do - firing an arrow into the sky that turned into a bolt of lightning to smite the baddie! I knew it was mythic, but my character sheet didn't suggest anything magical!<br/><br/>Anyway, so gripes aside, I'm sure the game itself is good when run properly. But, I think this is a wider problem with historical games - there is a tendency to treat history as invioable canon that has to be adhered to at all times, to an extent that wouldn't be expected of any other genre or setting. I've certainly found people reluctant to play historical games because the history has a tendency to get in the way. Anyone else found this?  <br/><br/>It's inspired me to make a Roman story game that somehow precludes this sort of play, but not sure how yet! Maybe just a big stick ...                        </div>

                            I run a lot of historical games, and while this doesn't happen in mine it is commonly cited by potential players as a concern before they have tried them so I think it is a common problem.<br/><br/>To be honest, it's mostly a question of GM advice (history is a setting, not a straightjacket) and remembering that you are there to play a game rather than give a history lesson, but it does seem to be a widespread GM fault.<br/><br/>To me though it's a GM error, possibly compounded by a lack of good advice on running historical games, rather than a system issue as such.<br/><br/>Interesting post Andrew.                        </div>

                            And it doesn't only happen with historical games. I am playing in a Tekumel campaign with some real tek-heads and there are long discourses there as well. I suppose that there is something like 30 years of history there but  IT'S MADE FUCKING UP . I am a big fan of the world and all but we were playing at different levels of realism. <br/><br/>Andrew - Would you have enjoyed the game more if there was an up front discussion of magic?                        </div>

                            Our group has run a number of pseudo-historical games, and I think we've addressed this problem in different ways.  In the first- a "weird WWII" game with classic horrors influencing the events of the war- our group's ground rules were that anything goes as long as it can plausibly be denied, covered-up, or otherwise glossed over by historians, leaving our modern-day understanding of history intact.  With that we were able to have zombies running rampant in Normandy, Cthulu-esque horrors in Dresden, and Japanese gods at Manzanar.  <br/><br/>The other game- set in a turn of the century, post-Martian invasion America- was rich with historical elements, but ran with the the agreement of the group that history had diverged with the invasion.  So while WWI still occurred, it began because of the race to control captured alien technology.<br/><br/>I suppose that's a long-winded way to say that it really comes down to agreement among the GM and players about how history is to be used in the storytelling.                        </div>

                            I think another issue here is tied into Jesse's musings about games that excite you around the game vs. those that excite you through the game. Oh, and the old issues of metaplot. <br/><br/>Historically most historical games have had systems in which the excitement about history had to come around the game, because the system didn't provide a lot of the details of history through the game. You'd do you mass of research, set up your intricate maps, plot out your million historical NPCs, and then hit the ground with a game system that was mostly about how much damage your weapon did and how many feet you could move in 3 seconds. Which, for the record, isn't always bad, as some historical players have tightly focused games of small unit military history. But, for many it does put the emphasis of the system on things that aren't many historical players main goal. <br/><br/>Now a game like Heroquest can do a good job of fixing this for people with a specific set of historical goals. People who want to explore the tensions and conflicts of history through the individual human angle should be able to get a lot of mileage out of HQ through, rather than around, the game system. Really, for many historical periods it should be possible to hard-code a lot of the conflict into the character sheets. <br/><br/>Playing the Albigensian Crusade? Set up characters with high scores in their "faithful Catholic" and "devout Cathar" traits, combine it with relationships between all the nobles going back to the early Franks, give Arnaud-Amaury a "callus bastard" of 15w4, tie the players to both Carcassonne and the French King and.... let it go. Players acting on the traits on their sheet should be able to make some real statements about history, really get in and feel the passion and tension and brutality that lead to the slaughter, the inquisition, and the breaking of the Occitan realms. <br/><br/>It seems to me that is one of the places where Andrew's GM went wrong. He didn't use the system to try to get at the important parts of history (possibly because those decisions weren't the important parts, in his mind) -- he tried to get at that all around the game. His excitement had nothing to do with playing the game, it had to do with talking about the setting and so his emphasis wasn't on ways to bring out the setting in the game, it was just on talking about it and getting excited about it almost seperatly from the game. <br/><br/>As for the whole 'well that wouldn't happen until 50 years..." Yea, that sounds much like the problem that everyone has with metaplot. Can you change it? Can you not? All the standard answers apply the same here, I'm thinking.                        </div>

                            I quite agree that this isn't a problem exclusive to historical games, although it does seem to crop up in more than its fair share. Maybe historical settings bring out the history teacher in all of us? <br/><br/>On the flip side I've heard people put off history games due to "not knowing enough history." I wonder if those same people would be put off playing Forgotten Realms without having read all the novels?<br/><br/>History is definitely a stumbling block when it comes to gaming, for a whole multitude of reasons it would seem. I think better advice is needed for sure, but that probably goes for all games!<br/><br/>As to Thor's question: no, I don't think an upfront discussion of magic would have helped. That incident was purely the icing on the cake of cruddiness.                        </div>

Well, if you like that kind of focussed gaming sure, but for me that would be throwing babies out with bathwater (not that I've ever actually thrown out bathwater, usually I shower and if I do bathe I just pull the plug afterwards, but I digress).<br/><br/>I have run a game set in the Alibgensian crusades, that kind of mechanical intrusion would have killed much of the fun for me, it's an answer but some decent GMing skills could equally have solved the problem without having mechanics that dictate a certain model of play once you kick off.                        </div>

As a datapoint, I got put off Glorantha by not knowing enough about it compared to others participating.<br/><br/>Sometimes people feel a need to comply with canon, to get it right as it were, I think that's pernicious but it's not uncommon.  I used to see it a lot with OWoD discussions, is x canon or not when the real question surely is whether x is going to add to your individual game or not.                        </div>

                            I'll try.<br/><br/>Jesse I think has a real distinction going on, the thing is that thing which for him is a bug is for some a feature.<br/><br/>My issue with what you described would be that it's predetermining the story, if we've set it up so the characters are a committed Catholic and Cathar and the engine drives that conflict then we know pretty much what story we're going to tell, and for me that kills much of the fun.<br/><br/>In real life, and yup I am going back to that old 1980s classic game design goal, it ain't much like that and so in my games I don't want it to be much like that either.  I want greater freedom than that.  I want to be surprised.<br/><br/>Now, in that game you referred to there would be surprises, it won't be some deterministic computer program, but for me surprise includes the kind of story we tell.  I don't care if my Albigensian game turns out to be a gritty tale of religious conflict or a comedy about smuggling supplies into a besieged city, that's for the players to work out.<br/><br/>It's not an HQ specific issue, it's a predetermining of scope issue.  Naturally there are degrees in this, by setting a game in that period I've already predetermined no ninja or spaceships, but within that setting I want the game to have the same freedom people in real life would.<br/><br/>It's also about duration, and this is where for me many great indie games don't float my boat.  I want at least the possibility of the game being open ended, I'm pretty old school in that.  Once we've played out the conflict between the Catholic and the Cathar we're done with that game.  With mine, once the siege of Toulouse got resolved, the characters moved on and we saw what happened to them next.  <br/><br/>What happened next was just as fun, but thematically had nothing much to do with the issues at stake at Toulouse.  LIfe doesn't have themes, and so I prefer my games not to either.<br/><br/>To be clear, ain't nothing wrong with themes if you like them, I just don't much is all, they tend to seem a bit trite to me as a rule.  Real life is far more complex, and grognard that I am realism (or more accurately verisimilitude) is part of my personal yardstick for a good game.<br/><br/>Feel free to challenge anything above, ideas only get developed through challenge in my experience.                        </div>

                            Max, <br/><br/>Good stuff! That's exactly the kind of response I was looking for. <br/><br/>Okay, lets see about addressing a few points: 
<blockquote>My issue with what you described would be that it's predetermining the story, if we've set it up so the characters are a committed Catholic and Cathar and the engine drives that conflict then we know pretty much what story we're going to tell, and for me that kills much of the fun.</blockquote>
Okay, I can see that. What about if we were talking Burning Wheel and the characters had beliefs that can (should) be changed or resolved durring play? So we know that the chracters are starting out as dedicated to the Catholic cause but may change that radically -- and be rewarded for changing it radically? For example, if after being at BÃ©ziers one of the crusader PCs says, "Screw this, I now believe that the Crusade must be stopped because the Church has become corrupt!" -- or something like that. That could radically change the story, right? <br/><br/>Like, it isn't that you're looking at the game being preset as "Cathar vs Catholic" as you don't want to be playing a game that is predetermined to be about religious conflict and its human price? So no matter what story you may end up telling in that theme (because there can be lots of different stories) its still too tight for you because the game is going to be about something? <br/><br/>I'm getting into this because there seems to be two things going on, one is about theme and one is about... um... an assumed story built unilaterally upon a one sided theme. The "I want the characters to just keep going and live their lives" is about theme at all, but the "real life is more complicated and themes are trite" speaks to me more of deaing with preset themes played out mechanically rather than with passion and human ambivalence. <br/><br/>If the characters in that religious conflict can be themselves conflicted, change beliefes, become uncertain, get lost in the morass of the human heart, would that be alright? Because, as you say "they tend to seem a bit trite to me as a rule. Real life is far more complex" -- but I only find that with themes that are shallow and preset. If you read any great work of literature you'll find a theme (or more than one), but that doesn't make it trite. In fact it does quite the opposite. <br/><br/>I think I'm starting to lean towards something Vincent articulated once about theme in game. It isn't that you start out a game with a theme, its that you end up with one at the end of the game. So you start with a "what happens when religion and politics colide in a world of feudal loyalty?" and only get to theme after you've seen the decisions the characters make. Its only at the end, after the confused and confusing choices, that you can make sense of it all. Rather, I feel, like history. <br/><br/>So, in short, is your grip about preset theme, about developing theme in game, about having theme at all? Is it because you don't want to emulate literature or even a historical composition (since Herodotus we've been writing histories that say not only what happened but why and what it means), but the actual life of the people as they were living it, and you don't see a way for theme to fit into that?                        </div>

                            On the excellent Burning Wheel wiki there is part of a historical adaptation, I'd play that in a shot.<br/><br/>But then, part of the brilliance of BW is that to the indie guys it looks all narrativisty and focused while to me it looks traditional with some cool extra mechanics.  I think that is part of its charm and crossover appeal, to me it's just a really good trad fantasy rpg and the fact to others it is something else is a testament to its quality.<br/><br/>Theme.  Hm.  Predetermined theme is definitely a no-no for me for the reasons cited, in particular that the story is closed and that by predetermining it we make it I think too shallow.<br/><br/>But, as you rightly say, theme need not be shallow.  If after play it is evident there was a theme or themes that's fine, I don't object in principle, it's just not a goal.<br/><br/>Part of it is that most premises I've seen expressed in question form seem a bit narrow.  "what happens when religion and politics colide in a world of feudal loyalty?"  Well, I only care to a limited extent to be blunt, for me historical gaming is about the setting.  For me the real question is "what's it like to live in this time?"  If I wanted a game to focus on an issue like the conflict between faith and duty I would see a novel setting as a distraction, in fact this is a key barrier for me with many narrativist game designs.  If the game is supposed to be about what we will sacrifice for power, why are we putting in a ton of unnecessary stuff about demons or starships?  Those things to me are distractions if the theme is a powerful human one like that.<br/><br/>Historical gaming is about the colour, it's about the setting, it's about living then.  Thematic gaming for me is weakened by having that kind of colour, if I want a game about making hard choices between love and loyalty or whatever I want it set in the real world right now so I can focus right in on those issues.<br/><br/>Not sure if I'm answering the question, but for me historical gaming is an exploratory or emulatory activity, as such you can address thematic questions in it but I rather wonder why you would want to when you could instead have a game in which those questions were right there at the forefront.                        </div>

                            To get back to the actual play in question...<br/>
<br/>
It was Mark, wasn't it? The GM? The author of the game? Come on Andrew, fess up. Mark would want to know. It's gotta be him. Because, well, he's a PHD in Russian history, and I can't think of anyone else who runs MR that knows enough to go on and on like you describe. And I'm pretty sure I know which con you went to, and I was thinking that Mark might be running there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my objection to Glorantha is slightly different than the above posters. It's that I know that if I get into Glorantha, I'll learn all of it's goofy history, and then start acting like the aforementioned GM, going on and on about the history. I play in a canon-light setting specifically because I tend to go on and on about it even then. Fortunately there isn't much to go on about, and soon I'm reminded that in play it's probably better to just be making stuff up to fit the play.<br/>
<br/>
For a fantasy world, at least. Though, I gotta say Max that I think you're just a big crusty-head who just hasn't let loose yet. Rather, it's funny, but I often find that games like Brand is talking about deliver more actual verisimilitude than the crusty grognardy games that get bogged down in things like armor penetration values which has little to nothing to do with the life of a soldier in early-Renaisance Florence. But I digress...<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what one could possibly mean as a difference between "addressing thematic questions," and having them be "right there at the forefront." Addressing only means that the players get to come up with answers to the questions in some way, as opposed to the questions getting answered for them.<br/>
<br/>
But, before you protest, yeah, I know what you're talking about. I just think they're less different/incompatible than you seem to think.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, the key to the discussion here is when does it go over the line with exposition on the historical? Put it this way, Max, would you have enjoyed the session that Andrew relates? I think that you'd agree that sidetracks like this are problematic even for your sort of play, especially if they don't really relate to what your character is supposed to be experiencing, right?<br/>

                            I'm finding this Brand-Max dialogue kind of fascinating, because for me the whole idea of history is to impose themes/narratives on seemingly unconnected facts. It is precisely the sort of history books you read in high school that like to reduce everything to conflicts between X and Y, and the sort of premises being described as 'trite.' And while real historians are not usually quite as reductive, they are mostly seem to be engaged in the same activity -- making stories out of real world events. Meanwhile, another impulse exists -- to faithfully represent what it was really like, through exhaustive reference to primary sources and a rigorous denial of the human desire to frame the facts. <br><br>So really, it's like we're just transposing the same two impulses -- both to my mind completely 'historical' -- into roleplaying.                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Though, I gotta say Max that I think you're just a big crusty-head who just hasn't let loose yet. Rather, it's funny, but I often find that games like Brand is talking about deliver more actual verisimilitude than the crusty grognardy games that get bogged down in things like armor penetration values which has little to nothing to do with the life of a soldier in early-Renaisance Florence. But I digress...</blockquote>
Um, Mike, this has my name in it but doesn't seem to relate much to what I said.  I don't play any games with armour penetration values or anything like that level of rules complexity.  I have run in fact historical games using Heroquest rather successfully, I was talking about themes above and I think expressly said I wasn't talking about Heroquest per se. <br><br>The HQ game I ran wasn't that different to most other's I've run.  My only issues with HQ are that I find opposed rolls all the time too much hassle and I find the extended contest system a bit dry, neither of which is remotely relevant to anything we're discussing here.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Anyhow, the key to the discussion here is when does it go over the line with exposition on the historical? Put it this way, Max, would you have enjoyed the session that Andrew relates? I think that you'd agree that sidetracks like this are problematic even for your sort of play, especially if they don't really relate to what your character is supposed to be experiencing, right?</blockquote>
No, I wouldn't have enjoyed it.  I think maybe the bit in my original post where I refer to this kind of thing as a GMing error that doesn't happen in my games was sort of a clue that this would not be something I would like.<br><br>I have no idea what you think my sort of play is, but you seem to think it's some stereotypical sim thing of dryly noting modifiers in order to get some kind of technical accuracy.  That's simply incorrect, for my goals a system that bogs down in technical detail is a disaster because there is nothing in looking up tables that makes you feel at all like you're there.<br><br>IMO HQ is an excellent system for historical gaming, I just wouldn't use it to set up the type of conflicts I was discussing with Brand.  In terms of my discussion with Brand though which span off from the OP none of this stuff is particularly relevant, because by and large these aren't system related issues.  They're GMing technique issues.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>&lt;//rant&gt;&lt;//rant&gt;&lt;//end&gt;&lt;//end&gt;I'm finding this Brand-Max dialogue kind of fascinating, because for me the whole idea of history is to impose themes/narratives on seemingly unconnected facts. It is precisely the sort of history books you read in high school that like to reduce everything to conflicts between X and Y, and the sort of premises being described as 'trite.' And while real historians are not usually quite as reductive, they are mostly seem to be engaged in the same activity -- making stories out of real world events. Meanwhile, another impulse exists -- to faithfully represent what it was really like, through exhaustive reference to primary sources and a rigorous denial of the human desire to frame the facts.<br><br>So really, it's like we're just transposing the same two impulses -- both to my mind completely 'historical' -- into roleplaying.</br></br></blockquote>
I think you're correct in how the idea of history works, but history books are after the fact.  In a historical game, or the kind I enjoy anyway, you're there at the time rather than after the fact and as such theme may be present but is not so much a goal.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?  It's not that theme is necessarily incompatible, it isn't, it's that it's by the by and so to focus on it isn't particularly productive in terms of the goals for play.<br/><br/>I think you are right though that there are two goals at work both of which are historical gaming, and both of which could potentially of course cohabit.  One is to explore history in terms of meaning, the other is to explore it in terms of experience.  The latter is where my interests lie, that doesn't mean you can't aim for both, but that only adds value if the former is also of interest.<br/><br/>Put another way, I'm not saying what can't be done, I'm saying what I like to do.  Different sort of statement.<br/><br/>The relevance to the overall thread is that for either the GMing in the OP is a problem, abstruse detail does not help you address theme and nor does it help you experience the feeling of being there, it's simply an academic intrusion into the game either way.  Of course, gaming is a large thing and there are groups out there for whom the point of play is to bring out that abstruse detail and a night spent discussing details of clothing is a night well spent.  One of my current players left their previous group precisely because that's what they were doing, and they were looking for something  different.  As interests go though, the interest in using the game merely as a springboard for academic discussion is not I think a common one.<br/><br/>Edit:  Just noticed one thing, capturing the feeling of being there does not mean exhaustive reference to primary sources and a rigorous denial of the human desire to frame the facts.  That sounds ghastly to me and I don't really see how that approach would help one feel as if one were there.                        </div>

That makes sense, sure. It's a bit different from what I was thinking of, which was more 'what someone thinks of when you tell them you're playing a game set in Stalinist Russia' (or insert other historical setting.) One type of history buff immediately thinks about all the themes inherent to Stalinist Russia, which have been revealed in a specific type of historical writing, or which the buff has his/herself extracted from their own reading. Another type immediately thinks about all the verisimilitudinous details that struck them as being fascinating-in-themselves when they were studying Stalinist Russia, and how they'll be able to use their knowledge to deliver a really authentic portrayal of people in that time.<br/><br/>The only issue I have with this is that ultimately both historians are actually doing the same thing, they're just exaggerating their differences. You can't extract meaning without details, and it's impossible to isolate details from the context that gives them meaning. That context will always be constructed, it doesn't matter if you're standing in the middle of history or standing outside it.<br/><br/>Which is where I have a problem with the quoted bit above. You <i>are</i> after the fact. That's why you call what you're doing historical roleplaying -- because it's not set in the time in which you live. Suggesting that this makes that type of roleplaying more plausible is disingenuous -- it's just as hard to have a roleplaying game where you pretend to be 'in the moment' of history as it is to write a history book that completely avoids framing 'moments of history'. Interpretation is inevitable, which doesn't mean it can't be minimized -- but I wasn't suggesting that you are roleplaying historians, merely that as students of history your roleplaying will inevitably incorporate all those themes and meanings you've ascribed to that moment of history.<br/><br/>As you've pointed out, that doesn't mean that play has to <i>focus</i> on those themes or meanings. But I don't think the scope or perspective of play is really going to be the determining factor -- it's going to be the mindset of the people playing towards history in general, and that part of history in particular.

Absolutely. As long as you aren't somehow trying to avoid or deny the former completely.

I think I was mostly just exaggerating some types to make my point clearer. But I think it does require that you deny your desire, as a player, to frame the facts from your current historical vantage point. Ideally you are replacing that desire with a similar desire on behalf of your character, from your character's point of view.                        </div>

Actually no, it wasn't! But I think it might have been one of his friends ... But he was a nice guy and I certainly don't want to embarrass him if he ever comes across this thread :-)<br/><br/>Now I wonder if, as the author of the book, Mark would have fallen into the same trap? Because surely if he's written the damned thing he has nothing to prove, and if anything knows that the best way to convey the feel of the era and the game is to run a fun game ... otherwise he'd have just written another thesis!

                            Comrades!<br/>
<br/>
Coming belatedly to this fascinating discussion, let me just make a few points:<br/>
<br/>
1. The problem with historical gaming is often that for some the emphasis is on the former, for others, the latter. There are those who enjoy the intricacies of verisimilitude, and don't mind accepting a degree of railroading of themes, outcomes, etc because it still gives them a greater feeling of immersion than watching the History channel. Then there are those who are in it for the gaming, and for whom, as has been said, the key thing is that a historical setting can offer colour, perhaps in a new and intriguing palette. Neither is right, neither wrong. However, the first variety really does require a high level of 'buy in' that you are more likely to find in an established group that has made a consensus decision. A con game, where players ought to be able to just pick up their characters and play, and where there will generally be a finite time slot, frankly suits the latter. IMO, of course.<br/>
<br/>
2. Ironically, I didn't get to run Mythic Russia at that con, in part because of other commitments and in part simply because I wanted to allow myself _some_ time to play and chat. However, I did write and run a big (41 player) Mythic Russia set freeform (LARP) game, Rising Tsar. Each Russian character received a single side of paper with a bare-bones outline of Russia in 1382 and another on 'Russian Ways' (superstitions, ways of address, etc) really just to ease them into character. OK, some characters with particular specialisms such as clergy received more, but even then I kept each such source to a single sheet of paper. Then, after a brief introduction, the players were unleashed. They really were amazing, and while on the one hand did work themselves into a Russian idiom, they also came up with far more weird and wonderful stuff than I could possibly have scripted. The moral, I would suggest, is that very lightly sketching the outlines can be at once stimulating and permissive for the players but nonetheless still give a game a very different feel evocating of its setting. After all, while what happened in the game proved very different from how events unfolded in the real world, (a) the players seemed to have fun and (b) it was still very much within the dramatic context of the real world challenges facing Russia at the time, something they all seemed to take on board.<br/>
<br/>
3. I'm not in any way criticising Andy's GM, who I know is a keen HQ/MR GM -- and, as a university lecturer, I'm always keen to see people reading history! All I would say is that my own experience of teaching and hopefully enthusing is to start with very broad and colourful brush strokes and then, as far as the needs of the class or lecture allow, find a way of tailoring the paedagogic lessons you want to impart to the interests and enthusiasms of the audience. Some will appreciate detailed analysis of historiographical debate, others want to hear all the gory rumours. What is entirely certain is that trying to force-feed detail into a class that hasn't already been primed to want to learn it, is as futile as, say, trying to force a gamer who wants to play a game instead to enjoy listening to an episodic lecture...<br/>
<br/>
All the best<br/>
