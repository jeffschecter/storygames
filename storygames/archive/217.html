                    Hey all, just a heads up in case y'all missed the thread:  Ross suggested some changed to the style sheets to make the yellow bar for Unread Posts more prominent.  I took that a step further and downloaded and readied about 6 new Stylesheets that you can choose. These are only available to forum members.<br/><br/>Go you your Accounts Page and choose Stylesheets.  The Clockwork ones are kinda like vanilla with different colors that look like they spilled out of an iMac commercial (I'm fond of Green and Purple). There's also Root Light and Dark, which are REALLY cool, but they also flip the tabs from the left to the right side. Feel free to play around and see which ones work for you.<br/><br/>Every now and again I'll import and test out new cool stylesheets as they become available.<br/><br/>If you stumble across a cool stylesheet for Vanilla, LMK and I'll test it out. If it passes, I'll throw it up here (note: Some don't pass, like "Rage" &lt;-- Cool style, but about 2-3 things were broken on it).<br/><br/>Also, another new feature that some of you may have noticed was the clever "Network Problem: Website Not Available" feature that my web provider offered story-games and all my other hosted sites. :-)  I've been assured that it's just growing pains (we did a HUGE server migration), and it only should last for no more than a minute or two, and only a very few times a day.  Still, though, for the next few weeks, I'd almost recommend that if you're writing a long post that you "Select-All and Copy" on your post before you submit, just in case something happens.  It's a habit I've picked up on other message boards (RPGNet in particular), but applies here as well.<br/><br/>I'm assured that it won't happen forever, but it's something to be expected for the next few weeks, especially early in the AM.<br/><br/>Uh... what else?  State of the Union? It's been about a month since this place started, so I might as well:<br/><br/>* Traffic is managable, and we average currently approximately 1/2 to 2/3 the traffic of the entirety of The Forge. Some of it is the nature of the forum software: I know when I post to the Forge or RPGNet, I won't return to the forum until I get the email ping saying "Someone responded to your subscribed thread!". This forum software is getting more and more features installed as time goes on, so I'll keep my eyes out for performance improving stuff.<br/><br/>* No moderation currently needed. Yay. Everyone's been civil.  There's been a few touchy bits, but most of that was resolved via whispered posts or just some simple human empathy and opsn discussion towards understanding. My Zen is intact.<br/><br/>* I think we've found our niche.  Someone else said to me, "Hey, you've just created The Gaming Outpost Mark II". I never really participated in good 'ol GO, but that sounds about right: The fine fat harvestable land between actual productive discussion and silly-fun, that's where this place firmly rests. I like the fact that I (or anyone) can bounce into a productive thread here and just drop a totally non-productive joke into a thread without totally derailing it, and everyone is cool with it.  Like Ross said, it's like "The Pub".  <br/><br/>* Originally, I planned on waiting "X Months" (2-3) and then locking this place down so that only members can view threads (save for the rss feeds, which will still export, and I'm fine with that).  I was planning this to curb growth to only folks who were really interested, or were recommended by others.  Basically, with lots of growth will come more people to be aware of, more chances for things to get out of whack, etc.  It was to be a growth-limiting procedure, only made to go live once there was enough of a regular user base.  I'm kinda rethinking that now. Or, if nothing else, creating a Guest account so that people can sign in and view threads but be unable to respond to them.  Just a "small step" to limit this place blowing up.  Thoughts?<br/><br/>* Personally, my participation on other forums has dropped significantly since this place started.  I just find the company appealing and the discussion fun.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            The new stylesheets are nice, but still, the distinction between read and unread is not quite enough for my eyes. But better than the just barely yellow and a smidgen more than just barely yellow of the original style. The root styles make good distinction, but I like to read text on the right hand side of the screen, not the left.<br/>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
I'm with JBR on this one.  We're at a nice size now.  I don't want to stop growth, but managing it would be a good thing.  Yeah, we're more freewheeling here at the Forge, but the "spout off whatever you want" mentality of the RPGnet variety is something I'd prefer to avoid.  I'd definately like to see a reincarnation of the old Gaming Outpost.  I really enjoyed that place.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

As I posted on someone's LJ about the issue, "Abso-fucking-lutely not".  If you see something cool that folks were talking about before, and you have a thought on it, for god sakes post on it. <br/><br/>I'd request no "lame resurrections": "Me too!" "LOL!" etc.  But if you have a THOUGHT you wnat to share, or you want to bring something new to a months-old discussion, give it a shot., It might take things in a new direction.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            It may well become a clique if you stop new people from coming in, or require people being vouched for.<br/>
<br/>
Only friends can come in? No new blood infusion? What if a dozen prolific posters go AWOL and you're not letting new posters come in?<br/>
<br/>
It also feels weird, I was going all sorts of "Hey, what is going on around here, how come I didn't hear of it?" when I first heard of this place. I think it was you Andy, that name-dropped it on RPG.net in a post. Many people won't even hear of this place, it's secretive, very secretive if a prolific RPG.net poster such as myself only heard of it by accident.<br/>
<br/>
I think either spread the word and limit the joining, or keep it secret but don't limit the joining. Keeping it both secret and close-fenced will make this place more stagnant and closed-minded than other fora, which is what this is here to solve in a way.                        </div>
