Cutthroat was a game that won a Ronny Award way back in 2005.  It just took me that long to figure out how I wanted to release it.  I went with a <a href="http://www.divine-games.org/products.htm" rel="nofollow">Periodical Model</a>, which was something new for me.  So far, it's had the ammount of success I was hoping for.  The ammount of money I've made from it will increase the quality of next year's releases 10 fold.

Matt and I shared booth space atthe Key20 table, but also recieved very nice support from everybody at the Forge booth. The game was very well recieved at the show, selling enough copies to completely pay our first print run.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe saw very nice sales directly following Gencon, which continued fairly steadily for several months. What I find is that when I promote the game it sells well and when I don't it sells only okay, so as I've been working on my new game since December sales have slumped a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n75% of our sale have come from our own site, but the book has also sold fairly well through distribution, and we continue to see monthly reorders. The PDF version of the game sold very well last year on our own site and on stores like DrivethruRPG and e23. PDF sales have dropped with the new year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game has sold... poorly... on IPR. I think there are a few reasons for this. First, Panty Explosion had already been available for 2 months before I was finally able to ship books to Brennan. By that point I belive a number of people who would have bought it through IPR had already purchased it other places. Secondly, since Matt and I operate our own store on our site I don''t feel the need to drive customers to IPR to get the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn October of last year I discovered that the PDf version of the game as being widly distributed via several file sharing sites. We experienced a brief sales drop but after contacting several of those sites and replacing the file with a tryout version of the game our sales came back very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial stuff: The big suprise for both Matt and I was how the game was recieved. For everybody who  really like the game there were just as many people who felt like it was a personal attack against them. People who had never seen, read or played the game felt very justified in publically labeling our game as a product for child molesters, rapists and perverts. I recieved several really nasty emails accusing us of creating a game that objectified young women and embiodied everything that was bad about the gaming industry.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunatly for everyone who seemed to hate the game there were people who actually took the time to play the game, read the book, review it, write actually play reports or teach friends how to play. When we were creating the game Matt and I were both afraid that we were making something that no one else would ever play. It's been a relief to see that that just wasn't the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58994/#Comment_58994" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T08:31:47+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  8:31AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/coldprev.html" rel="nofollow">Cold City</a> has given me a lot of personal satisfaction since the release at Gen Con.

It is a character-focused game set in a steampunk space opera setting.  I've sold about 80% of my first print run (and really need to get another one going so I don't run out of stock) and broke even a little over a month ago.  I've run a number of games at conventions and did in-booth demos at GenCon SoCal.  Colin did a <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12685.phtml" rel="nofollow">review</a> at RPGnet, which gave me a little latter-day bump in sales.<br><br>Response has been good with the people I've played with, but otherwise I sometimes feel that I'm shipping the book out into space since I don't hear much afterwards.  This isn't too surprising, since the game is nichey and the book is pretty dense; with the number of indie titles out there, setting time aside to read through the damn thing may be difficult.

A little ironic that that's the start date of the range. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br/>In May 2006, I published Don't Rest Your Head as a print-on-demand product.  Somehow, it caught fire -- possibly because it got the attention of Phil Reed -- and became a decent-sized hit (from small press perspectives).  When DexCon rolled around, I got a chance to meet Brennan Taylor and talk about signing on with IPR.  Evil Hat joined the IPR crew a few weeks later, starting with selling DRYH and hinting that Spirit of the Century would come along soon enough.  Meanwhile, on RPG.net, Phil Reed's DRYH thread kept going and going, getting dubbed "Don't Rest Your Thread" by Ben Lehman.<br/><br/>I hadn't planned on attending GenCon in 2006, but a surprise offer from Clinton Nixon to sit in on the Lulu booth got Rob Donoghue and myself to make the road-trip.  This, plus DexCon, amounted to a year in which I met a ton of people from Story-Games, the Forge, and elsewhere.  Good stuff, from a networking and friendship perspective.  While at GenCon, IPR sold DRYH in the Forge booth, since this was (I think) their first year running it.  To my surprise, DRYH sold out.<br/><br/>In late September 2006, the preorder period for Spirit of the Century began, running through up to early November.  Thanks in great part to two things -- a pre-established fan-base for Fate, and our decision to make the PDF free and immediately available to anyone who preordered the product -- the preorders were very strong, and lead to another big surge of product awareness over on RPG.net (not due to Phil Reed this time, but his function here was replaced by our army of Fate devotees).  We expected sales to taper off following the preorder period, but they really didn't, and continue to be strong through to today.  Over the course of the last 4-5 months, SOTC got some outside-of-RPG.net boosts on two big fronts: voices of authority in the RPG scene (such as Bruce Baugh) came out very positive, very enthusiastic about SOTC, and SOTC got a chance to bite hard in the RPG podcast arena, getting some pretty impressive air-time in all.  It seems to be getting another boost recently thanks to the announcement of the development of a supplement for SOTC entitled "New Horizons", taking on the issues surrounding minorities in the pulps head-on, to be written by Bruce Baugh.<br/><br/>In both of these products' cases, their steady and strong "viral" spread throughout the RPG market has been very much supported by actual play experiences.  Folks have been running these games at conventions or at home, and each time the game gets run, some of the players come away wanting to own the products.  I'd heard the maxim that "actual play sells games" before, but hadn't had any direct experience with that.  Looking at the recent Dreamation convention as an illustration, however, it seemed to be pretty strongly supported: three Spirit of the Century games were run there (none of them by Evil Hat staffers!) and SOTC came away one of the strongest sellers for IPR.<br/><br/>If you're interested in Evil Hat's sales numbers, I try to post about them quarterly on my LiveJournal.  <a href="http://drivingblind.livejournal.com/tag/sales+numbers" rel="nofollow">Follow this link for more.</a>  2007's first quarter is looking pretty strong too.<br/><br/>During this time, I also got the chance to do layout and minor promotional work on Chad Underkoffler's Zorcerer of Zo, probably the best version of the PDQ system to yet emerge from Atomic Sock Monkey Press.  It's a great little project and I was very happy to be a part of it.  It also gave me a chance to watch a product I wasn't directly involved with from the inside, allowing me to compare and contrast things with my own experiences with Evil Hat's products.  Which leads me to...<br/><br/>If I were to distill the lessons of the year, it would be something like this: (continued in my next post)                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59000/#Comment_59000" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T09:42:56+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  9:42AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<ul><li> Be available to your fans.  Give them the thrill of direct access to the creators.  Let them know they are heard, they are respected, and that they are awesome.<br/><br/></li><li> Thank your detractors and show them respect, even if it doesn't feel like you should.  The classier you can look in the face of bad press, the more fans you'll create of you as a person.  When people like you, they want to like your games, and they want to buy your games.  (I've ended up falling on both sides of this, both succeeding and failing at it, during the year, and both cases have been pretty fucking enlightening.)<br/><br/></li><li> Encourage actual play and conversation about actual play.  But more importantly, be sure your encouragements make it clear that actual play without a <i>public expression</i> of it doesn't help the game sell anywhere near as much.  When someone writes to you telling you about their awesome play, ask them to go to a well-traficked site (like RPG.net for example) and post about it.  (This is one of those ZoZ lessons; I realized it was happening with SOTC but not with ZoZ as much, so I encouraged folks posting to the Zorcerer of Zo mailing list to take their actual play reports over to RPG.net.  It definitely helped spread the word and the enthusiasm about that game.)<br/><br/></li><li> Cherish your fans.  Build them slow and steady, and lose none of them.  They are your sales base, to be sure, but more, they're your sales *force*.  And they're a sales force that doesn't cost you a thing, dollar-wise.  They get out there, they tell others that your game is cool, they get others to buy your game.<br/><br/></li><li> If you've got a "fan-donated sales force", paying for advertisement isn't much use at all.   Fans get the message out about your product with more authority, more pervasively, more reliably.  An ad is you telling someone why you're cool; that's never as effective as someone ELSE telling someone why you're cool.<br/><br/></li><li> Speak with authority, but don't speak with finality.  When you're interacting with your customers and fans, definitely give the official word when they're asking for it, but also uphold your fans' ideas as being just as valid, if not more valid, than your own.  This helps online conversations continue, instead of dying out when you speak your opinion (thus, finality -- which is bad).  Continuing online conversations are active, interesting, engaging billboards for your game.  <br/><br/></li><li> Give your game something chewy, even if it's "rules-light".  People really, really love to fiddle around with an unusual game mechanic, and this spawns conversations about your game.  Think of it like a caramel candy: it needs to be something that sticks to the teeth, that prolongs the experience of eating it, and rewards with continuing sweetness as it's being eaten.  DRYH's odd little die mechanic and ratcheting on-the-brink stuff offered this for that game.  SOTC had plenty of aspects and stunts notions for folks to fiddle with.<br/><br/></li><li> Make sure your roleplaying game is a game as much as a tool for roleplaying.  When I was working on DRYH and playtesting it, the first version didn't really click, didn't sell the premise and feel that I wanted, and I wasn't sure why.  But then my Evil Hat partner Rob piped up saying "This game is a good story, but I'm not really feeling like I can take away the narration parts and still have an interesting 'board game' or 'dice game' to play with."  That one statement from him set off a huge light-bulb for me, and got nearly all of the current-form mechanics of DRYH set down on the page within 48 hours of hearing that.  If you want your game to grab onto the brains of the people who play it, you gotta make the *game* fun on a level pf parity with how the *roleplaying* is fun.<br/><br/></li><li> Character creation should be just as much fun as playing the game.  I've expounded on this elsewhere; see my <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23429.0" rel="nofollow">impromptu character creation manifesto</a> over on the Forge.<br/><br/></li><li> Explain, explain, explain.  Never ever assume that something should be left unspoken in your game.  Provide copious examples.  Don't just provide rules for your game; tell people how to apply the rules effectively, and take the extra paragraph to explain why the rule is there.  Connect the functions of your game with real, practical, actual play technique.  When people feel like they "get" the game right down to its bones, they feel freer to customize it for their own play and preferences.  This means that your game becomes *more perfect* for them, even if it ends up being played not quite like the game the way you'd run it.  And that's cool, because it means everyone's getting a lot of fun out of the game -- which feeds back into the whole fan supply thing.</li></ul>\nI'm sure there's more, but that's where I'm at today.

But more importantly, be sure your encouragements make it clear that actual play without a<i>public expression</i>of it doesn't help the game sell anywhere near as much. When someone writes to you telling you about their awesome play, ask them to go to a well-traficked site (like RPG.net for example) and post about it. (This is one of those ZoZ lessons; I realized it was happening with SOTC but not with ZoZ as much, so I encouraged folks posting to the Zorcerer of Zo mailing list to take their actual play reports over to RPG.net. It definitely helped spread the word and the enthusiasm about that game.)</blockquote>\nI've said it before, I'll say it again: Word-of-mouth is key. (Demos, APs, and suchlike all count as "word-of-mouth" here.)<br/><br/>And I am beginning to think that it is possibly even more than that: it is the ONLY way that adventure games get sold. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Fans get the message out about your product with more authority, more pervasively, more reliably.

And, in some cases, you telling someone why you're cool is anti-effective.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Speak with authority, but don't speak with finality. When you're interacting with your customers and fans, definitely give the official word when they're asking for it, but also uphold your fans' ideas as being just as valid, if not more valid, than your own. This helps online conversations continue, instead of dying out when you speak your opinion (thus, finality -- which is bad). Continuing online conversations are active, interesting, engaging billboards for your game.</blockquote>\nAgreed. This is something I struggle with constantly; there is something about the manner or method in which I communicate about my games that often carries (unintentional) finality. I am working hard to overcome this, but a good chunk of it is just shutting up... which is difficult enough for a motormouth like me. <br/><br/>CU                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59009/#Comment_59009" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T10:22:16+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 10:22AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bully Pulpit Games released <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/index.php?game=roach" rel="nofollow">The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</a> last March, originally selling through our own site and after a few months through IPR.  Since the game ships with cards,  we have not made a .pdf version available.  The game has been a success for us and we made back our initial investment in the first 48 hours of sales, and have gone on to do two reprints.  We also had a great Gen Con.  I demoed relentlessly, which helped a lot.  Right now I'm obsessed with our <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23427.0" rel="nofollow">next game</a>, but I'm really proud of what we've done so far and excited for the future.<br/><br/>I'll echo Fred's comments about actual play, which has been a major part of The Roach's success.  To every person who has posted an actual play experience somewhere - many thanks.  Now go write a review!<br/><br/>Here's some of what I've learned:<br/><br/>1.  People will make it their own.  In the case of The Roach, this typically means truncating or cutting scenes to fit a particular time slot, or house-ruling stakes-setting.  It's also a joy to see the game kit-bashed into weird shapes that I couldn't anticipate, like a simulation of rock and roll bands.  <br/><br/>2.  There's a large and positive community of people who will support your efforts if you are motivated and contributing in turn.  The spirit of DIY mutualism is really a wonderful thing.  I've made many friends and received great advice along the way, and try hard to help others in kind whenever I can.  I'm also a third of a team (with segedy here at S-G and the <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~murphy/mad_irishman/" rel="nofollow">Mad Irishman</a>), which is also a very satisfying arrangement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59010/#Comment_59010" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T10:27:54+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 10:27AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, this thread is serving to illustrate quite how much cool stuff came out in 2006!

All 50 copies sold out, due to the book cover (which reminds people of <i>300</i>), running lots of demos, and the excellent salesmanship of the Forge booth people.<br/><br/>Since GenCon, sales have been great (IMO). I usually post my exact sales figures to <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">The Mighty Atom</a>, but in short, I'm averaging around 50 copies per month. I expected sales to decline slightly over time, which they have. I'm curious to see if selling at IPR will cause a new spike in numbers. Ken Hite will be reviewing the game in Out of the Box, which will probably create some interest as well.<br/><br/>I tend to have better sales days when someone posts about the game on RPGnet, so I try to foster discussion there without being too mercenary about it. Fred Hicks is a good person to emulate on that front. Some of the RPGnet regulars like Robert Ahrens and Dyjoots have repeatedly said nice things about the game, which has definitely driven sales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59017/#Comment_59017" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T10:40:51+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 10:40AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: andrew_kenrick</cite>Those comments on creating buzz and driving sales are pure gold, Fred and Chad!

Created buzz tends to die down pretty quickly. <br/><br/>You can encourage true buzz, and you can try to harness it, sure -- but buzz arises in and of itself, ultimately.<br/><br/>My opinions on driving sales are similar, but I do think a publisher/author has a bit more power and control over that.

It has definitely moved me to a different level, sales-wise, than where I was before; but on the other hand the objective numbers haven't been that high. It seemed to take a long time for it to percolate through, and it did by stealth rather than with a fanfare. It still hasn't got a review at RPGnet, which I think is an important boost to have, though I have now provided them with a hardcopy.<br/><br/>But it did get an Honourable Mention in the Outies, which was a nice surprise.<br/><br/>I also put out some minigames in the NUGGETS series, capitalising on the 2-page ruleset I've had knocking around to get some ideas out of my brain without spending a lot of time on them.
