I apologize if this has been discussed in detail elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm currently in a place where it's virtually impossible to get a gaming group together, so my options for games is limited to PbF or with my SO. We only have a couple of boardgames with us, an internet connection, and a desire to play some story-telling games. From what I've read about Fiasco, it would be a great fit for us, but I've never seen anyone discuss a 2-player variant, nor does it seem like it would work particularly well. Microscope also looks interesting, but a bit heavy on the scene rules and details. We are also more inclined towards games where we influence persistent characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the point: Archipelago II looks like it would work fine with two-players, but is there enough creative back-and-forth with such a small group? Some people have said that they have tried it with two people, but I haven't been able to find a writeup of such a session. Does anyone want to chime in? Are there any suggested changes to the game for playing with two people? I think increasing the number of destiny points we write for each other would be a good idea - anything else? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any insight or other suggestions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377286/#Comment_377286" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T08:21:43+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  8:21AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played 2-player with my son, who's ten. It works fine as written (but then, I would say that, having written the game). It's a bit intense - you have to pay attention the whole time. And you might want to allow more than one Fate card per player for the session, just in case someone needs a bit of extra input. I suggest having small breaks between turns to give you some breathing space. Also, wine is often great (although I didn't use that particular technique when playing with my son).<br/><br/>(One of my absolutely favorite two-player sessions was with "Society of Dreamers", playing with my wife. Intense, atmospheric and just really nice. "Catherine", however, just ended up horribly sad.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377289/#Comment_377289" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T08:37:53+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  8:37AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two-player Archipelago sounds totally do-able. One kink might be the limited ownership of elements, so double up on those so there are four.<br/><br/>If you wanted to try two-player Fiasco, set it up as a four-player game and own two initially-unconnected characters each. I've never tried it but it'd probably work all right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grepth" title="Grepth"><img alt="Grepth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grepth">Grepth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377404/#Comment_377404" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T21:27:38+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  9:27PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, a response from both creators!
