The idea is that not having any visual distractions would presumably make for a different imagined experience (including time-distortion, potentially).<br/><br/>I haven't played significantly with impaired people (that I know of), but I'd go for written mediums if I was deaf, myself. Being blinded here and now wouldn't affect my roleplaying so dramatically, I guess, although it would certainly affect everything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159025/#Comment_159025" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T03:07:31+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  3:07AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing a game deaf and blindfolded is a good approximation of playing any game at all through IRC or email you know                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159030/#Comment_159030" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T04:47:53+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  4:47AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2008 5:41AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Nathan,<br/><br/>I know half a dozen visually impaired or blind gamers and the ones I'm closest to are really into L5R and D&amp;D 3.5 right now.

In terms of techniques, the L5R and 3.5 guys both use laptops, screen readers, die rolling apps and spreadsheets for their character sheets.  <br/><br/>I wrote a small game that is intended to level the playing field between sighted and non-sighted players - <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/ghosts/ghosts_01.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ghosts</a>.
