The idea is to reboot or reimagine crusty old ideas, taking whatever in there was actually cool, ripping out the rest, then turning the cool bits up to 11. <br/><br/>It's a bit like a meal I had once which, according to the restaurant menu, had 12 prawns in it. The rest of the meal was pretty unexciting, so I ended up just picking through it looking for prawns until I found 12. Like that, only with extra hot sauce to dip the prawns in.<br/><br/>So: clerics. D&amp;D introduced them as some kind of descendant of the Militant Orders of the Crusades (because in D&amp;D, you don't want a character who can't or won't fight), but we don't have to stick with that. What would make professional religious people interesting as a type of character to play? What have you done in the past? What kind of special abilities and powers should they have, if any? What should set them apart from other types of character?<br/><br/>D&amp;D clerics tended to end up as just hit-point-dispense-o-mats.

The religious ones are clerics, and the power point system makes playing one similar to a D&amp;D cleric. There are also healers, who heal yb transferring others' wounds onto themselves and then healing them. Finally there are Lay Healers, which heal by laying on hands and giving prosthetic limbs.<br/><br/>The latter two are the most interesting to me, especially the healers. You can play one and have an extremely resilient combat dude, with or without the spell list that lets you transfer wounds onto yourself. Basically I guess what I'm saying is that a "cleric" type class should be playable without ever using a healing spell on someone else. Whether that means they transfer wounds or not is secondary to the ability to be free of the stereotypical healer role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85675/#Comment_85675" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T15:58:33+00:00" title="August  5, 2007  3:58PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2007 4:02PM by noclue.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D clerics essentially are paladins.

They only take a few vows, act as military arm of the church, may or may not have magic powers. I'm thinking most of all of the 4 Military orders in the Eddings books (not the mallorean, the other ones... Elene?): the Pandion, Genidian, and so on are the only heavy cavalry in the setting, and the only ones allowed to study magic.<br><br>2 - Keepers of the knowledge: think medieval monks. They were practically the only ones who could read and write, worked at copying texts to preserve the knowledge, and some of them travelled very LONG distances (for the period standards, anyway).

Almost everything that's been said about how to awsemofie clerics is already contained in HQ. Starting with ditching the idea of a common list of "spells" for priests and such. HQ has several entire models for what could be considered "clerics" in other settings, to say nothing of dozens of examples of actual cults that could be followed. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the general breakdowns for magic keywords in HQ:<br/>\n - Liturgist - The "western priest" (based largely off Christian models)<br/>\n - Orderlies - The "western religious order" guys<br/>\n - Orderly Liturgist - One can even follow the "friar" model<br/>\n - Devotee - The "ancient polytheistic adherent" model <br/>\n - Shaman - The "medicine man" model <br/>\n<br/>\nThen combine these with any occupation to get more combinations of models:<br/>\nDevotee + Warrior = Paladin of Thor<br/>\nDevotee + God Talker = Village Priest<br/>\nOrderly + Warrior = Knight Templar<br/>\nLiturgist + Warrior = Fighting Cleric<br/>\nLiturgist + Priest = Local Pastor<br/>\nShaman + Warrior = Spirit Warrior<br/>\nShaman + Spirit Talker = Local Medicine Man<br/>\nOrderly Liturgist + Warrior = Friar Tuck<br/>\nOrderly Liturgist + Priest = Order Spiritual Leader<br/>\nDevotee + Farmer = Inspired Farmer<br/>\n<br/>\nThat last is to show that there's any number of combinations, not just the typical. You can have any character with any occupation with any sort of magic background. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's all before you get into the individual cults, which further multiply things:<br/>\nDevotee + Warrior + Odin = Paladin of Odin<br/>\nDevotee + Scholar + Odin = Holy Scholar of Odin<br/>\nDevotee + Warrior + Loki = War-trickster of Loki<br/>\nDevotee + Thief + Loki = Trickster of Loki<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic abilities vary by each sort of cult. So Odin has different abilities than Loki, who both have very different sorts of abilities from, say, some liturgist organization, or the spirits that a Shaman learns about. Add to this the skill-sets for occupations, and you can see that the possibilities are endless. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy limit yourself to just one pattern? When you can blow it wide open into the myriad sorts of religious characters that one can imagine to play? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85768/#Comment_85768" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T08:55:49+00:00" title="August  6, 2007  8:55AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kaare Berg</cite><strong>Or, y'know ... make the rest of the playing party concerned about the state of their souls.

In game terms he forces an alignment audit, wherein the character's behavior is compared to his alignment, and he may be in trouble if he's found wanting. The most extreme case follows the AD&amp;D strategy of losing and level and changing alignment to match your behavior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85851/#Comment_85851" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T12:24:30+00:00" title="August  6, 2007 12:24PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Get rid of bards.

Tough combatants, and some of the most useful and interesting spells in the game. WotC folk have said that this is intentional, to alleviate the "Somebody's got to play the cleric" syndrome of previous D&amp;D versions.<br><br>I think the key to "awesome-o-fying" them, however, is to <i>alleviate their necessity</i>. What diminishes their awesome-ness (in the story sense) is that <i>every party needs one</i>. Ergo, having a cleric in the party isn't typically a choice made for story reasons. It's made because, unless you really tweak the other PC builds, the party is going to <i>die</i> otherwise.<br><br/>Someone, maybe Mearls, once said that one of the awesome side-effects of the Reserve Point optional rule was that, having eliminated the need for lots of healing, clerics could instead focus on using their other kewl powerz and be more than just the party medic.<br/><br/>Ergo, I think a key to awesome would be to make it so that players chose to play a cleric because they wanted to explore the role of magical divine servant, and not because "we gotta have a cleric."<br/><br/>I also think you could not change a thing about D&amp;D, but still make play interesting by actually working together to create a party with a unified religious theme, instead of the typical bunch of grave-robbers + guy who worships Pelor. E.g., an entire party of Pelor-ites led by a cleric: cleric, paladin, mystic theurge, some sanctified rogue/scout type or divine bard. Then, focus their adventures on missions given to them by the church elders.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86063/#Comment_86063" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T08:09:42+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  8:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You need a source for healing. You don't necessarily need a cleric. That's just one of the many routes to the goal. <br/><br/>There are now a whole bunch of classes that can cover that, ranging from highly combat focused martial adepts, to dragon shamans who can make better support characters than bards, to feats that fill the slot. And many of them have limited infinite healing and ooze flavor (Dragon Shamen and Crusaders for instance). You can even cover the need for healing without a single spellcaster in the group by stocking the rogue withseveral wands of cure light wounds. There's definitely a "we need a cleric" mindset, but it's based in an incomplete understanding of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86084/#Comment_86084" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T08:47:25+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  8:47AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>There's definitely a "we need a cleric" mindset, but it's based in an incomplete understanding of the game.</blockquote>\nWotC has indeed made great strides in "spreading the healing love" among lots of cool new classes. That said, the cleric is still really, <i>really</i> good at it. Eschewing the class involves some planning when putting a party together. Granted, this is often true of all the core archetypes, but the cleric is just the most obvious.<br/><br/>Mearls' <i>Iron Heroes</i> totally removes clerics as a class, as well as magical healing. Yet, one of the sample PCs in the "To Kill A King" demo adventure is a religious fanatic (a berserker, iirc). It's way cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86098/#Comment_86098" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T09:29:38+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  9:29AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The cleric is good, but nowhere near the beat.

The system and setting work together to have damn near everything in Creation possess a little God or more, and you can pray to these gods for benefits. The difficulty is insanely high, and priest status just gives you a few bonus dice. The benefits are also left intentionally vague (the GM determines some sort of subtle bonus that the god can provide later, preferably a non-numeric one).<br/><br/>As GM you could easily enhance the priestiness of cleric-types by upping the impact of successful prayers, and basing the bonus for being a priest on the character's overall priestly nature as revealed through roleplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
