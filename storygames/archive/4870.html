A possible reason comes to mind:<br/><br/>Imagine that Player A just framed a scene. Now it's the next player's turn. Player B might be hesitant to scene frame and narrate something that Player A introduced in the last scene. Why? <br/><br/>-Player B might not be into whatever Player A introduced, and might want to focus on a different part of the imaginary space.<br/><br/>-Player B might feel like he or she _has_ to narrate something different, so as not to feel like a plagiarist--you gotta come up with something new and different, or you're just copying the previous player!<br/><br/>-Player B might feel like they're stepping on some of Player A's territory by doing that. For instance, if Player A did a great job roleplaying the Duke of Ingham (as an NPC), Player B might hesitate to introduce Duke Ingham because he or she feels like they couldn't roleplay that NPC as well as Player A just did--they wouldn't be doing the Duke justice..Or, if Player A introduced a mysterious chest, Player B might assume the player had something in mind, and thus hesitates to create their own "contents", preferring to leave it up to Player A to reveal that mystery.<br/><br/>-It seems "safer" to stick to your own, new material than risk warping or corrupting another player's fictional material and getting into an argument or creating bad feelings. <br/><br/>-Finally, everyone's got some ideas. With your turn to frame only coming around so often, by the time you're up you might be itching to introduce your idea and make your creative input. Following up on the last player's contribution would mean losing the chance to introduce your own new material.<br/><br/>Any of those sound familiar?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109235/#Comment_109235" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T19:45:34+00:00" title="November 21, 2007  7:45PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2007 7:46PM by Ry.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite>Basically, there's a party by default - even though intra-party dynamics are different than they typically are in, say, D&amp;D.</blockquote>\nIf you were rotating GMing responsibilities on a scene-by-scene basis in D&amp;D, do you think the problem would persist, or would the increased efficacy of a group serve as a counterweight?

So, if the number of players is limited and one player is producing, there is less chance of multiple PCs interacting in the same scene.<br/><br/>2) The knowledge is shared. In the traditional RPGs, there is a lot of "you know this but your PC doesn't because he wasn't there" or whatever. When I play games like PTA, the knowledge is more easily shared and it is frequently assumed that a PC not in the scene may use the knowledge acquired by a different PC as long as it makes sense and is good for the story ("you have a good excuse"). This could lead to a more dynamic plot and even though the players are not in the same scene, they are interacting in a way. If I think of my traditional games, even when the players are together, they are doing separated things and interacting much more with the environment and NPCs rather than within the group.<br/><br/>3) If your session time is limited, I think it tends to exacerbate the other points.<br/><br/>4) It could have to do with the style of the game/plot. If you play a game where there was a murder and some or all of the players are trying to find out who the assassin was and at the same time some or all of them are among the suspects (with the real possibility that the PC was the murderer), there is no way they wouldn't interact quite a bit. <br/><br/>5) I don't think it has to do with the fact that the game was designed to play with a GM. The way I see it, PTA is much friendlier for multiple characters in a scene than, for example, Polaris. In PTA if your PC is included in a scene initiated by another PC, even if your screen presence is lower, you can participate in the conflict to attempt your agenda. While in Polaris, only the heart and the mistaken have an active participation in the conflict.<br/><br/>6) I think that unless you play with the intent of increasing PC-to-PC in-scene interaction, the tendency you noticed will persist. On the other hand, I don't think the current status means that the PCs/players are playing several different games. I think the interaction is happening at a different level.<br/><br/>I like your method of rotating the producer. One concern: there needs to be trust as the producer has no incentive in holding back the budget. If he/she uses a high number of tokens to increase the difficulty, this means that the future producers will have less budget and there is more fanmail available to the players including him (or her).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109328/#Comment_109328" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-22T20:55:13+00:00" title="November 22, 2007  8:55PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you follow the suggestions in the book.

In my experience, ask players of a traditional D&amp;D group to describe "what their characters did in the 6 months between the last adventure and the kick off for this one" and they will explode out in as many different directions of solitary activity as there are players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109572/#Comment_109572" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T12:26:15+00:00" title="November 25, 2007 12:26PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, if I'm understanding bubble-play term correctly, I've observed the same phenomenon in Polaris. That is, we tend to have almost-completely-separate story arcs for each protagonist. Sure, there's some cross-over, but I'd say 80% of our scenes are single protagonist only.<br/><br/>One set of exceptions involved a very sharp hierarchy: one character was the General, another was a Full Knight, and the third was a Squire to the Full Knight. When multiple characters were present, the subordinate would fade into the background as a supporting character.<br/><br/>Another exception resulted in a major in-character argument between knights. I was playing the non-scene protagonist, and I started to feel like the scene was becoming about my protagonist. Since it was the other players "turn" to have a scene about him, this made me uncomfortable, so I removed my character from the scene by having him storm off.<br/><br/>I think it has something to do with pro-active agendas. Polaris knights tend to be highly resourceful, driven, and pro-active entities. When multiple such people get together, they either share an agenda, or they don't. If they share an agenda, one person tends to naturally become the leader. If they don't share an agenda, they tend to get into conflict with each other. It's possible to get shared agenda with equality, but its a knife-edge case.<br/><br/>With GMed games, I've been thinking about how one would handle a game with multiple pro-active players - where every player is trying to push an agenda. again, either the agendas line up, in which case one might as well have one leader (one proactive player, every other player reactive), or they don't line up, and the game focus changes to PC versus PC conflicts. <br/><br/>Basically, I'm starting to think something like "There can only be one hero" at any given moment of time. So one solution is to rotate who gets to be the hero from scene to scene. But if some characters are inherently heroic, then this amounts to rotating the characters. <br/><br/>We did some experiments with this in an otherwise traditional game. I made two characters - a very high status character and a very low status character. The other player had a medium status character. We then rotated scenes. In one scene I played my high-status character, and dominated the agenda. Then I switched to the low status character, and the other player dominated the agenda. My scenes focused more on big-picture politics; his on small-focus skulduggery. They were about the same overall plot, but even here it was kinda like two separate "bubbles"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109603/#Comment_109603" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T21:51:09+00:00" title="November 25, 2007  9:51PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite>In fact, yes.
