For a long time I've been hesitant to run with my group, The whole time thinking of something Jason said about playing 6-player fiasco "Why would you want to?" Well, because that's the size of my group and I wanted to play fiasco with these people. Well, I decided to say "To hell with limits" and just went ahead and did it. <br/><br/>We didn't do any group splitting or anything else to otherwise modify the game to accommodate 6 players. And, well... It went perfectly. There were absolutely no issues. From start of setup to end of aftermath it took about 4 hours, which for us is a standard gaming session, and this was a group of 5 people who knew nothing about how Fiasco worked. I don't know what all the fuss is about. other than a few hiccups with how setting the scenes worked it went totally smoothly.<br/><br/>So, just thought I'd let people know it can work just fine.<br/><br/>We played Boomtown. We had Three Needs, Two Objects and 1 Location (The two objects each kind of offered implied locations).                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407114/#Comment_407114" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T16:04:06+00:00" title="February 24, 2013  4:04PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad you had a good time!<br/><br/>The two big reasons I think playing with six is a bad idea are the time involved (four hours, as you say, which is double what a four player game should take) and the way relationships and details are distributed (you begin with three characters who have no connection to yours, instead of one, and a scattering of needs). <br/><br/>The former is problematic because lots of people don't have four hours, and the latter is a genre emulation issue - neo-noir tends to keep it in the family and focus on one thing.<br/><br/>But like you and others have demonstrated, if you're down with it a six player game can work.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tensen01" title="Tensen01"><img alt="Tensen01" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/257/nJB7ZNBC44W33.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tensen01">Tensen01</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407122/#Comment_407122" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T16:40:18+00:00" title="February 24, 2013  4:40PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can certainly see it being a problem in some Genres. Noir for one as you mentioned. But I think a lot of them easily accommodate lots of character. And those that wouldn't necessarily can easily be made to by an good group who focuses Setup a little bit. I think next time I may actually suggest two of every detail, as one of the Needs didn't come into play other than to introduce an NPC antagonist who became central to the conflict and I think we could have used a second Location. But that will depend on the playset. Thankfully there's enough that we can kind of pick and chose ones that fit a large group... Though we've already had a vote for LA 1936.<br/><br/>The way our relationships worked out, three of the characters were family-related so at the table we kind of assumed if you had a relationship with one of them you easily knew the others. So we only had one player who didn't know the family on the cards, but she was pulled in because she was the Crime boss and had her fingers in everything and actually owned the mortgage on the family ranch.<br/><br/>We had a great time and everyone agreed to include Fiasco in our Rotation                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
