So we made <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/animal_rescue_vigilantes/animal_rescue_vigilantes_1.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">Animal Rescue Vigilante</a> - I came up with a very simple resolution system and Autumn made up some lists.  We tried it out last night and it was really fun.<br/><br/>A few things that are thought-provoking to me about this experiment:<br/><br/>First of all, Autumn "hates roleplaying games".  She doesn't <i>really</i>, but that's her line, and she's got a firewall where our respective hobbies are concerned.  But building the game around something she was interested in not only engaged her, but got her to participate in building it.  Her request was "a game where I get to kill people who are mean to animals".  OK, then!  <br/><br/>The system is very simple.  You compare cards; there's a tactical trade-off between the amount of harm you want to inflict and your chance of success at saving an animal in peril and punishing the evil-doer.  You can finesse this a little bit but not much.  This was all inspired by Autumn, who thinks dice are a buzzkill  and doesn't hold with any sort of complexity, but loves to invent people and situations and tell stories.  It was a good challenge for me, because I'm trying to learn to off-load some of the possibility space in my designs from the mechanics anyway.  <br/><br/>So we played and it was fun!  A coherent and engaging story emerged and the random card-draw missions hung together nicely.  Autumn played the Rescuer (of course) who she named "Autumn", and didn't have a ton of success - one out of six challenges, in fact, but we had a great time.  One set of elements was Skunk - Athlete - Exploitation - Shopping Mall, and that ended up being a promotional tour for Skunkworx running shoes, with star athlete Jordan Aire and a de-scented skunk who was kept cramped up in a box.  The missions were sort of adorable, even in failure.  <br/><br/>It really felt like we'd crafted something that was just for Autumn, hitting all her buttons, and she was delighted.  I'm very happy with it, and big thanks to Graham for suggesting the contest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126191/#Comment_126191" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T10:09:12+00:00" title="February 13, 2008 10:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like fun. I really like the lists.<br/><br/>I think it's interesting that failure was still fun for Autumn in a game so tuned to her wish-fulfillment. How did you handle it when the Vigilante failed to rescue? I'm guessing that the animal remaining in peril and abuse wasn't an option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126196/#Comment_126196" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T10:17:03+00:00" title="February 13, 2008 10:17AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually it was - she accepted that she wasn't going to save every animal out there.  Her 1 in 6 record across three missions meant she failed to even ruffle a bad guy's feathers, and left a middle school science class octopus and that skunk behind, but she took great pleasure in rescuing, tending, and finally liberating a deer that was being used as bear bait by an evil trapper named Suckerfish (yeah, that was all me).  I was a little surprised, too.  The odds are stacked against Rescuer success unless she shepherds her resources and take a few losses.  <br/><br/>This is barely a game, but I'm really interested in that liminal space between game and not-game anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126202/#Comment_126202" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T10:27:27+00:00" title="February 13, 2008 10:27AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grand Theft PETA.

He delivered for a well-known carbonated beverage company, and with his company cell phone frequently called in dogs left in cars in the summer sun.  Sometimes he'd break in and give the dogs water, but mostly he just called it in to avoid being brought up on charges. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day he came across a white subaru with a dog inside, and he called but Animal Control didn't have any trucks available immediately.  So he managed to pull the window down a crack, pour some water in for the dog to lap it, and then, because he had to leave to finish his rounds, He pulled out a sharpie.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe called Animal Control back and told them he had to go, but to look for the white subaru that said "Dog-Abusing Mother Fucker" on the hood, and left. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo days later, he saw that guy trying to scrub the sharpie off the paint at a car wash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Laura%20Bishop" title="Laura Bishop"><img alt="Laura Bishop" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/433/nKL1G7M6ODYGZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Laura%20Bishop">Laura Bishop</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127892/#Comment_127892" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T02:22:49+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  2:22AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a volunteer with the <a href="http://natcat.org/" rel="nofollow">National Cat Protection Society</a>, I approve of Animal Rescue Vigilante!<br/><br/>&gt;^..^&lt; o O ( Thanks, Autumn! )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128171/#Comment_128171" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T15:53:46+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  3:53PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>I feel like you missed John's first question.
