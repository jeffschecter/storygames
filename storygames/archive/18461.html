I really like narrative driven games and plan on working that out. I have the setting down (A medium fantasy setting), basic layout of the 'overarching' story (I.E This is the world and this is what's happened up till now) and am about to start working on the system. So far I have some flavor text and a list of things I'd like to see in my game (It's really rough but this is going somewhere I promise!):<br/><br/><b>This is Domhaine.</b> A world similar to ours, a world where the natural evolution of man was altered by a unique property of their universe. A power known as the Aivictus, Aivictus permeates the world laying just beneath the surface of the seen. Areas high in Aivictus are changed and the art of Ivclinio, or The Change is possible. Ivclinio is the ability of some, particular, special individuals, to bend reality to their wills. <br/><br/>Those humans who lived in places of high Aivictus took on the properties of the dominant beasts.  These people are the Bjorn, the Wulf, Ophidia, Panthera and the Otariidae.<br/><br/>Despite the amazing attributes of this world, or because of it, this Domhaine is dying. Because of the actions of one Ivclinio invoker, chaos has fallen over the world. <br/><br/>The Bjorn people are hearty folk, generally covered in this body hair, large and muscular. They are lethargic during the winter months. They don't seek out conquest and are only interested in protecting their lands and holdings. Slow to anger but devastating when provoked.<br/><br/>The people of Wulf are lean, slightly pointed ears, elongated canines. Tactical masters, their armies work in perfect unison. Family or the Pack is the most important aspect of their culture. <br/><br/>Ophidia people are a strange alien people. Slender, long limbed with large black eyes with slit like pupils. Forked tongue and a love of alchemy, particularly poisons. They are said to hate all Hot Blooded peoples and employ ambush tactics from the shadows. <br/><br/><br/><b>Flavor Quotes:</b><br/>"It came as a shock, the betrayal. Ulther's actions that day brought ruin on the Wulfguard and damned the world to chaos. Our people are shamed." Galthor Howlkeeper, telling of the fall of the Wulf - year AF 143<br/><br/>"And then, the balefire fell from the bruised sky to burn everything it touched. Not in a cleansing fire, but in a wave of corruption that forever changed our world." Galthor Howlkeeper, telling of the fall of the Wulf - year AF 143<br/><br/><b>System ideas:</b><br/><br/>City building/guild ownership features. (No idea how to do this right now...I want it though!)<br/><br/>Ditch the Charisma stat, play your character like you would, be convincing, or not.. Maybe have a system to help like WOD etiquette. <br/><br/>Gm-less or close, maybe have a Director who handles rule disputes...<br/><br/>Write in skill system (Suggestions and examples but no set skills and abilities. Base cost + specialization I.E Guns/Speed loading)<br/><br/>Action resolution - attribute score + d6 (D6 is pretty universal) vs opponents. (Maybe have live action variants?)<br/><br/>Assumed any skill is average unless specified specifically either way.<br/><br/>Emphasize that your character should have faults (award players for playing fualts) and overall personal goals<br/><br/><br/>Ok, so right now it's pretty short list right? But some of those things in there are pretty daunting! A City building/guild ownership system? <br/><br/>So along with ANY help you want to give me (verbally that is), do you suppose I'm thinking too big? Do you think a Director/Judge and not a GM is feasible or even fun (Maybe a player who is voted as the go to for rule disputes? But then who stops him if he wants to always vote on his own side in the matter of personal disputes)? Does this setting sound unique enough to get your attention (despite the poorly written nature of the flavor text) based on a quick read?<br/><br/>Any other ideas or suggestions you want to give me?<br/><br/>Thanks a ton!<br/>Patrick                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415738/#Comment_415738" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T12:41:03+00:00" title="June  8, 2013 12:41PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tons of GMless games out there.

If you write the game correctly, there will be no disputes. Perhaps the older always wins unless in certain cases? Perhaps the person to the left narrates? Perhaps a <i>goal</i> always win over a <i>will</i> and each scene is made by a goal in mind?<br/><br/>It seems like the ideas are somewhere between narrative based games and traditional games, so I would suggest to start reading some more games. I would suggest reading <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/a-thousand-years-under-the-sun/" rel="nofollow">A Thousand Years Under the Sun</a>, <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/archipelago-iii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a> and possibly <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b>.

This is as stremlined as you can get. You can add futher descrptions, detail resources and have personal agendas for every member, but all that can be worked as you play. This can be something quick made by all players in prep and would help them a lot to get familiar with the setting really quick.

So I take it that those things are super important to you and to making the game be what you are envisioning.<br/><br/>So to start with, how do you envision your group of players interacting with the race/culture definitions? Would an ideal group of players be each playing one of the races, or would it be more ideal if they were all of the same race/culture? Or perhaps you don't have a one player one character relationship - maybe each player basically represents a whole race/culture, or at least those people of the race/culture that are in the play area?<br/><br/>The other idea you are focused on is city building and guild ownership. So what does that mean to you? Do you want something similar to the late game Adventurer Conqueror King elements? Maybe something similar to Pendragon?<br/><br/>And again, how do you see the races/cultures interacting with city/guild level play? Would an ideal player set consist of the movers and shakers of a single city and it's guilds with one race/culture dominant, or multiple cities of different races/cultures near each other? Are the players in heavy conflict with each other or allies?<br/><br/>And how do you reconcile city/guild politics play with wandering adventurer out to save the world from the evil Ivclinio invoker stuff? What do you want the players to actually be doing during the game?<br/><br/>Honestly, the "evil Ivclinio invoker" stuff sounds more like video game plot (where there is exactly one story to play through, though it may have plenty of side quests along the way) than a productive tabletop setting element. If you're not extremely devoted to it, I'd consider dropping that part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415935/#Comment_415935" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T19:52:35+00:00" title="June 10, 2013  7:52PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like your world history is a big part of the fun for you!  I used to write and GM that way, and I miss it.  I had good reasons for stopping -- world meta-plot seldom has any bearing on these player characters fighting this monster in this tavern right now -- but if I had to go back, I might try the exact opposite.  Make play <i>completely about</i> the uber-plot, such that character creation is about defining where characters fit into the history, factions, and larger forces in the world.  Maybe put the player characters <i>in charge</i> of some of these elements.  <br/><br/>Just a thought.  <br/><br/>There's also some wisdom in just leaving the big stuff as background flavor and aiming play at other things.  From your description, I don't really know what those other things might be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
