We picked the God Kings of War oracle, and got these 4 elements:<br/> - <i>The very first time that a certain young soldier, impressed against his choice and wanting nothing more than to return to his home, has killed.</i><br/> - <i>A genius of flame, imprisoned within a brass mirror.</i><br/> - <i>An order of magician-monks who punish blasphemers.</i><br/> - <i>The campsite of a traveling army, not long deserted.</i><br/><br/>From these we came up with the following ideas. The traveling army belonged to a king who had come to the monks' home city and imprisoned the monks' god, the genious of flame, within a small, handheld brass mirror. Doing so made them blasphemers in the monks' eyes, so they were chasing the army down in order to free their god. The young soldier belonged to the king's army. The abandoned camp would be that of the king's army, mostly abandoned while they invaded the city and imprisoned the god.<br/><br/>My 4 players selected the following Player Characters (in quotes is the description they wrote on their character sheets):<br/> - <b>Pope Thunderblat VIII</b> "The Stout", leader of the order of magician-monks. "A spherical, balding man with a bushy mustache and a great fondness for women, drink, food, and squat ponies, which he collects."<br/> - <b>Talos</b>, the Abbot of Uncleanliness, a lesser leader in the order of magician-monks. "Magician-monk who specializes in battle magic, especially plague and shields."<br/> - <b>General Baharanth</b>, of the king's army. "6'3", piercing ice-blue eyes, muscular, big blonde beard down to his waist, imposing, slightly blustering aura. Fond of Amazonian blondes, big-ass weaponry, horse-manship, his men, and pork pie. Ambitious as hell, despite his humbler pursuits."<br/> - <b>Morfen</b>, the young soldier with his first kill. "Young soldier for the king, first time in battle."<br/>And that left 2 NPCs for me:<br/> - <b>King Nikanuur</b>, leader of the traveling army and imprisoner of the flame god.<br/> - <b>Ahkrimaz</b>, the genious of flame, revered as a god by the magician-monks.<br/><br/> These were the Best Interests everyone came up with:<br/>  - <b>Pope Thunderblat VIII</b>: <br/>  \t- Reclaim the genious of flame<br/>  \t- Force the blasphemous general to recant his heresy and join the order<br/>  - <b>King Nikanuur</b>:<br/>  \t- Escape with the genious of flame<br/>  \t- Make Morfen into a real soldier of a man<br/>  - <b>Talos</b>:<br/>  \t- Defeat soldiers of the army<br/>  \t- Free Ahkrimaz<br/>  \t- Protect the Pope<br/>  - <b>Morfen</b>:<br/>  \t- Run away<br/>  \t- Resurrect the soldier he had slain<br/>  - <b>Ahkrimaz</b>:<br/>  \t- Escape imprisonment<br/>  \t- Ensnare Morfen into his service<br/>  - <b>General Baharanth</b>:<br/>  \t- Defeat monks<br/>  \t- Secure the mirror for his own use<br/>  \t- Convince the Pope to let him become his apprentice                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Serpentine_Cougar" title="Serpentine_Cougar"><img alt="Serpentine_Cougar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Serpentine_Cougar">Serpentine_Cougar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404688/#Comment_404688" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T14:30:23+00:00" title="January 26, 2013  2:30PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started by asking where the magician monks lived, and the Pope's player said that they lived in the wilderness, in a great city of obsidian. So we began with a scene in the city, right after Morfen had killed his first enemy soldier by slicing him through the throat. Morfen was with a group of soldiers under General Baharanth, and Talos was just arriving on the scene with a posse of monks. Morfen nearly fainted when he realized he had killed a man, and Baharanth picked him up. As Talos' men moved forward to attack, Morfen leaped for an alleyway, dragging Baharanth with him. Baharanth tried to get back out to lead his men, but tripped and fell on the cobblestones. Talos's mages killed a large portion of Baharanth's men with necrotic magics and chased him off.<br/><br/>In the next scene, the pope attacked the king in a different part of the city by invoking magic from his chamber at the top of a tower in the center of the city. Thunderblat sent bolts of lightning down on the king from the sky, while the king's bodyguards protected him. The king also sent a squad of assassins into the pope's tower to slay the monks' leader. The pope killed the assassins, but the king was blasted and wounded. I think there was some more fighting involved here that involved Talos and Baharanth, but I can't remember the details.<br/><br/>Then Thunderblat called lightning down on the king again, whose mages popped up a magic shield that blocked it, but then Thunderblat sent lightning up from the ground and killed the king that way instead. Morfen ran up, snatched the pouch containing the mirror off the king and ran away with it. The king's bodyguards flung magic bolts after him, but they fell short. Morfen clambered up a ladder onto a rooftop and started running along the roofs, Assassin's Creed style. Baharanth picked up a bow and shot a couple arrows after him, and the king's mages hurled more magic his way. Obsidian roof shingles went flying, shimmering in the air, but didn't touch Morfen. Then Morfen fell through a ceiling and out of sight. Baharanth and the king's bodyguards gave up.<br/><br/>While hiding in the building, Morfen took the mirror out of the pouch. Ahkrimaz whispered through the mirror to Morfen, offering him power beyond belief. After some brief negotiating, Morfen agreed to free the genious of fire and serve him for two years in return for protection and the resurrection of the soldier he had killed. Speaking an incantation provided him by Ahkrimaz, he smashed the mirror on the floor. With a burst of fire, the genious of fire emerged from his imprisonment. As part of his breaking free, a great shaft of fiery light sprung up into the sky from the mirror, breaking holes in the ceiling and roof of the building and giving away their location.<br/><br/>Talos (at the telepathic command of Thunderblat) and Baharanth broke away from their fighting and moved towards the building as Morfen and Ahkrimaz left for the slain soldier. Ahkrimaz brought life back to the soldier Morfen had killed, though the man remained unconscious. Talos arrived and groveled before his god, begging to be told what to do, while Baharanth hid himself behind some cover on a nearby rooftop. Ahkrimaz at this point most wanted revenge, so he told Morfen to go to the army's camp and set a trap for them. Talos he told to kill the king's remaining soldiers and chase them back to their camp.<br/><br/>As Talos and Morfen left, Baharanth had some wizards under his command begin a ritual to entrap the genious of flame in a sword. After muttering incantations and sprinkling holy water on the sword, the general swiped the sword in the air. Ethereal bars appeared around Ahkrimaz, who lost the conflict rather poorly and became entrapped once more, this time in Baharanth's sword. The general then made his way back to the camp.<br/><br/>Back at the army's camp, Morfen set the tents on fire. Baharanth and the remnants of the king's army showed up, as did Talos. Fighting ensued, General Baharanth perished, the sword was shattered, and Ahkrimaz freed once again. The End.<br/><br/> * * * <br/><br/>This was only the second time I have ever run In A Wicked Age. Three of my players had played in my first game; only for General Baharanth's player was this the first time with the game. I felt bad that Baharanth lost so badly, since it was his player's first time, but that outcome just seemed to fit the fiction best. Still, they seemed to enjoy themselves, and I can't wait to play this with them again.<br/><br/>Things went much more smoothly this time around than my first game. Part of that was because we were all more familiar with the mechanics, but part of it was also because one of the players from the first game didn't play this time. He has a tendency to take things more gonzo and not-fitting-the-tone than I like. We had 4 players this time instead of 5, which I think helped the game go more smoothly as well.<br/><br/>By the end, no one was left on the Owe List (everyone had wanted advantage dice). You may have also noticed that I didn't mention any Particular Strengths. We hadn't used them in our first game because people were already confused enough with the base mechanics. I didn't bring them up for this game either because of Baharanth's player. I think I'll introduce them next time though, now that people have a grasp of how the mechanics work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
