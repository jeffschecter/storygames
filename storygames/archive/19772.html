It was great! We'll try to keep this conversation going on and one of the best ways is showing you what we're talking about around here, some of our games and impressions on how things are working out here. The cultural differences are really huge and I guess there is much to learn from both sides.<br/><br/>For those that don't know The Analog XP yet, it is a Patreon project I started earlier this year to introduce our community to English speaking gamers. I don't really like the Patreon interface so I created a wordpress where you can download each issue. You can find the new one <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> at the following link:<br/><br/><a href="https://analogxp.wordpress.com/2014/09/25/the-analog-xp-issue-4/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="https://analogxp.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/downbut4.jpg?w=474&amp;h=174"/><br/>https://analogxp.wordpress.com/2014/09/25/the-analog-xp-issue-4/</a><br/><br/>Now we're talking about the Brazilian game conventions (nothing near Gen Con), one of my theories on game development i call "Narrative DNA", and then a discussion that is going on for ages here about 'why can't all the games we make possibly be called RPG' as most people here do. I really would like to know if any of these is something you already discussed or it is also a regular topic for English speaking gamers and developers.<br/><br/>You can support this project on Patreon!<br/><a href="http://www.patreon.com/encho" rel="nofollow">http://www.patreon.com/encho</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
