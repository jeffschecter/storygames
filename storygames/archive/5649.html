I realized modern plots can fit as well as fantasy tropes.  Everyone else, your ideas are awesome as well.  A few of my own...(I have a system of my own where I call gods/goddess Divinities).<br/>\n<br/>\nA cruel entity is imprisoned underneath a volcanic mountain range.  The PCs are in charge of keeping it from the outside world.  It is whispering to them, promising them power in exchange for being released.  Its favors start with information and slowly evolve to greater interference in their affairs.  However, accepting help means the prison grows weaker.  Will they be able to find out before it\u2019s too late?  Are the promises genuine or were they lies to get out of its prison?<br/>\n<br/>\nMany creatures have stories which trace their origins to being transformed by a Divinity.  One of the animal species has gathered together and they demand to be changed back.  There were not changed by the PCs.  They tell a tale of woe designed to move them.  However, their removal from the natural order will cause environmental harm.  Is it more important to right an ancient wrong or to save the environment?<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce an eon, a creature who is able to increase the power of one divinity has been roaming the galaxy.  The Great Hunt is on.  Will the PCs partake of this event and if they find it, how will decide who receives the benefit for catching the creature?  <br/>\n<br/>\nA group of divinities has decided to dispense with priests and other church officials.  They are charging a set rate in exchange for various benefits.  Followers start to worship them because they think that they have easier access to the divine.  Are the divinities engaging in a social experiment or are others forcing them to sell their power to the highest bidder?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126814/#Comment_126814" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T09:26:39+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  9:26AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a rumor among divinities, a strange and wondrous substance has been spotted among mortals.

After some investigations, the Ambrosy is tracked down to one Immortal who is selling it to mortals. What's the true agenda of the immortal?
