I wrote my second game last night.<br/><br/>The Wanderer.<br/><a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dg94g5hc_7d88xt7cq" rel="nofollow">Black-on-White Googledocs version.</a><br/>\u201cA long time ago there was a wilderland both terrible and lonely where the beasts and devils of this world lay in wait to devour the flesh of men and mock their folly.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThe Wanderer\u201d is a simple roleplaying game invoking the conventions of the Sword &amp; Sorcery fantasy subgenre but adding a few modern twists. The players jointly narrate the adventures of a single protagonist as he travels through a land of both heartbreaking beauty and deadly adversity. <br/><br/><i>\u201cThe Wilderland is a Place of Devils. Built on the bones of countless slaves, the palace-fortresses of the devils lie isolated about this place, trapped by some forgotten misfortune. Decadent and wicked, the devils live in prideful, smoke-blind luxury as self-proclaimed sultans and sorcerer-kings. Armies of spirits and orb-like watchers patrol their nations, forever warring and spying on one another and those who dare trespass.\u201c</i><br/><br/>I get no points for originality, but if you have the time to read (2700 words) and appreciate storytelling mechanics and the Sword &amp; Sorcery genre I'd kill for some feedback.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/> Mike.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250132/#Comment_250132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-08T19:30:46+00:00" title="January  8, 2010  7:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, this looks cool, Mike!<br/><br/>I say "Looks" because i haven't read it - the tiny white font over black is killing my eyes.<br/>&amp; i was about to just copy it into an office document, but thought that since others have given <i>me</i> a hard time about <br/>small font illegibility, and i appreciated their input... well, that i should pass these savings on to you.<br/><br/>besides, when i copy it, the numbered or bulleted entries' respective numbers and bullets aren't copied, and i thought those might be important.<br/><br/>hurry up! make it better for me!<br/><br/>-jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250134/#Comment_250134" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-08T20:42:25+00:00" title="January  8, 2010  8:42PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second Jackson's comment about it being hard on the eyes to read.<br/><br/>A.)

For the Scenario? I've heard of people taking to a game, but making a cover immediately after reading... you must need more creative outlets. <i>[wink]</i><br/><br/>My design philosophy was, as put eloquently by another: "Don't write what you won't use." As for the advice, the game needs to be played in a fashion distinct from the traditional GM-Player axis (I'm a jeepform fan) so I needed to establish this from the outset for otherwise it's a game with very few gimmicks. <br/><br/>Never having played the game myself, I've no idea if the voting resolution would work. My thought was that play continues uninterrupted until someone goes "No, wait, I don't like that. It should happen like X,Y,Z" and then the group votes on which path play should continue. I'm wasn't sure of much, but I was sure I didn't want random-chance as part of this game; all the inventiveness at the table should be what the group brings with them (for better or worse). <br/><br/>If a story develops quickly and entertains the participants within an hour, I see no reason why it couldn't be shorter than the traditional evening's worth. Alternatively, I was toying with the idea of an hour's run with the Director writing down events as they happen then re-starting the Scenario for another hour's play and either a) exactly the same events as last time but everyone swaps characters or b) new characters but events of the first hour are happening in the background (and players get tokens for finding connections 'Yeah, you know when my fifth first-hour character knocked down an old man with the Camaro? Well, I'm playing that old man.') - although I wonder if the paradoxes inherent in that kind of play would be possible to work with. I could include both in an 'alternate re-play' section. Hm.. this is what playtesting is for!<br/><br/>The IRC-channel playnow (as muchly advertised by Sam H) is amenable to playtesting. Show up, Jackson.

Also, I think you should consider the concept of Facts &amp; Reassurances from A Penny for My Thoughts, this kind of creative free-for-all can easily get derailed if you don't set down a baseline from the get go. If I were to try this out, I would probably construct a set of cheatsheets with the rules and bullet point advice to leave in front of the participants. If you make some to go with the game from the start, it'd be a powerful packet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that I love the weight you have put on giving advice to director and players, plus that as director you're not bogged down with any other obligations than keeping the story fresh and rolling. That alone makes it great warmup, as the gamemaster is not drained of creativity by having to juggle npcs and setting. I have been looking for something like this and I hope to bring it to the table for some playtesting, next time I have geeks in the house.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250241/#Comment_250241" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-10T17:01:54+00:00" title="January 10, 2010  5:01PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2010 5:34PM by Potemkin.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, let's do this in reverse order. <br/><br/><b>RivoClavis</b>, thanks for reading. It's awesome you find this cool. I'm really very excited about improv-around-the-table; I want something like Norwegian free/<a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/" rel="nofollow">jeepform</a> but combined with just enough rules/restrictions to make those theatrical elements sing like crystal. The Scenario is me trying to fine-tune and perhaps the second draft (and later games I write) will find that balance of player-driven creative/active freedom and safe-zone, table-sitting 'R.P.G' legitimacy.<br/><br/>You, and others, are right about the short-and-sharp aspect, but I need to playtest to see <i>how</i> right you are. I would hope in the format that a group could fit 3+ hours of narrative progress into 1. I might try for an anthology of one-hour games which, while being distinct experiences, could fill a evening and reinforce one another. <br/><br/>You've a point about the tokens. They're there to encourage (positive) groupthink behavior: the group expects certain standards of behavior/action etc and reinforces the the same through token reward. I shouldn't have to use it at all! I'll work out what's absolutely necessary and reduct.  I haven't read <i>A Penny for My Thoughts</i>; if you could explain Facts &amp; Reassurances, I'd be grateful. <br/><br/>Advice! Advice! So few games actually guide potential players in how to play, I mean really <i>play</i>, not just what the rules are. I hope I give sound advice. I'd die, literally die of creative fulfillment if someone was to play this game. God, I'm lame - but thanks.<br/><br/><b>Deadlytoque</b>, thanks to you to. I'd glad someone else appreciates the class of white-on-black. Fight the man! The game is meant to be quick, following the inclinations of the director: a character sounds interesting, let's follow him, see if he fleshes out. If not, let's go somewhere else. No regrets. <br/><br/>I'd hope it could be picked up, read aloud and gotten into. Cheers for the feedback. <br/><br/><b>Jackson</b>. Freekin' sweet! Is... is that my name in print? Oh, oh... I like this feeling. I like this feeling <i>a lot</i>. Now I just need to figure out how to do .pdf files. <br/><br/>We're going to get a little <i>Being John Malkovich</i> here. I can see myself writing games-within-games whose conflicts are resolved by the action of an overarching ur-game. I urge you to be online and play with me sometime, although I'd imagine it'd loose a lot of possible improv charm in text-form. Play it with real people if you can, I'd love to see if it works, at all! <br/><br/>Thank you, the cover's stunning and your responses heartening.<br/><br/>Edit P.S: In any second-drafts I was thinking of upping the 52 example Signs to ten-times that number, all closely packed on a single page maybe.

In the game you are also starting of at a blank start so to speak, and improvise the setting as you go along. The F&amp;R is a sheet where you have the basic rules and restrictions on what kind of setting you may build into. It is actually just being up front about how far the creativity can go, so you don't break the other participants immersion by introducing a 300 year old vampire out of the blue, when they thought the game was being played in a normal world. The function is to remove the need to negotiate the validity of input during gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250285/#Comment_250285" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T05:30:57+00:00" title="January 11, 2010  5:30AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>RivoClavis</b>. Me, understand game theory? Ho ho ho. I was told off by Ron Edwards once over on the Forge for questioning, admittedly inarticulately, the nature of shared imagined space. I just know how I'd like to be addressed by a game manual and reproduced to that effect. <br/>Hmm. Facts &amp; Reassurances certainly sound like a practical solution to the not-quite-blank-canvas dilemma. A twist on the premise might be to put the creation of these imaginative-perimeters (a perimeter mustn't be thought of pejoratively here; it's a focusing-lens not a prison) into the hands of the players; pre-game the players would specify one element that will not appear in the game. They could, in addition, specify an element or theme they'd like to see occur but I feel that's a little heavy-handed.<br/><br/><i>"There will be no supernatural</i> characters <i>in this game."</i><br/><i>"There will be no depictions of sexual abuse in this game."</i><br/><i>"There will be no Hollywood machismo in this game."</i><br/><i>"There will be no genuinely attainable riches or power in this game."</i><br/><br/>This nice broad spread frames our canvas-world without any direct intervention from the designer or the GM; the players self-regulate and enforce their own expectations. Hm, I'll think more on this. I don't <i>really</i> want to have to lift from pre-existent games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250337/#Comment_250337" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T11:52:48+00:00" title="January 11, 2010 11:52AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not lifting from existing games, its setting up common expectations for the game, something everyone should do, verbally, each time they sit down to game. But you've got the right sight on it, perimeter is a good label. Also remember that restrictions bread creativitiy, it's a clich\xe9, but true.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, being chewed out by mr. Edwards has nothing to do with anything, least of all roleplaying theory... don't get me started on that whole mess. Not using The One True Model of the Forge does not mean that you don't have an understanding of how roleplaying ought to work and attempt to put that into practice via your writing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250370/#Comment_250370" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T16:12:54+00:00" title="January 11, 2010  4:12PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RivoClavis</cite> Also remember that restrictions bread creativitiy, it's a clich\xe9, but true.</blockquote>\nI think I put that in the fifth paragraph. <br/><br/>As for perimeters, perhaps an improv-based mini-game could be devised before play begins proper: The Director starts an 'And Then...' story, perhaps, and at each juncture the players are prompted to cheer or boo whatever comes up. <br/>Viz.<br/><i>"A man wakes up in his bed." [Boo! Dull!]</i><br/><i>"And then realises another man is sleeping next to him." [Wheey! Meow! Hubba-hubba!]</i><br/><i>"And then realises a space-monster is sleeping on his other side!" [Boo! That's stupid!]</i><br/>The play-group's expectations are gauged and the director can turn play to that end. <br/><br/>I'm with you on the Forge thing.
