If it attacks it's usually because it hunts for food, or because it wants to defend its nest (a cave or burrow in the forest). The snake would rather eat horses than humans and does not stay for to fight if it can retire with a tasty snack. When the snake attacks with its tail, it is to trip opponents.<br/><br/>The snake has an icy breath that can envelop its victims like a very cold smoke or fog. Those who are trapped in the smoke only have clear view for a few feet (-2 to attack in close combat, aiming a ranged attack is basically impossible). The smoke disperses after 1T6+2 rounds. It takes one round for the snake to use its icy breath. In the meantime, it can't do anything but defend itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379777/#Comment_379777" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T15:33:28+00:00" title="May 25, 2012  3:33PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Here's something I found on an old site of mine when I was rummaging:)<br/><br/><code>Dear Mr. or Ms. NYGMA:<br/>Thank you for submitting your DESIGN for an ELECTRONIC TOY, GAME, OR DEVICE.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we cannot produce your ELECTRONIC TOY, GAME OR DEVICE at this time.<br/><br/>Good luck in your future endeavors.<br/><br/>Herbert Lando<br/>Schumacher Games, Inc.</code> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379784/#Comment_379784" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T17:31:21+00:00" title="May 25, 2012  5:31PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yrididheosis Heididisus<br/>\nLevel 8 Disease<br/>\nThe Yridithe bird carries a terrible virus that can infect many other species, most notably humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttack: +10 vs. Fortitude<br/>\nEndurance: improve DC 24, maintain DC 20, worsen DC 19 or lower<br/>\nThe target is fully cured<br/>\nInitial: The target experiences smells like a whiff of poisonous fume<br/>\n2nd stage: The target must move 5 feet back for ever 20 feet moved in a straight line<br/>\n3rd stage: The target screams incoherently when attempting conversation of any kind <br/>\n4th stage: The target walks in circles screaming at least ten minutes out of every hour, or collapses in convulsions (also convulses while asleep, waking with the exhausted condition)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379785/#Comment_379785" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T17:31:42+00:00" title="May 25, 2012  5:31PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2012 5:32PM by Brian_Minter.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>LYNDON JOHNSON</b><br/>Senate Majority Leader, Bitter Vice-President, President, Inspiration for Foghorn Leghorn<br/><br/><b>Traits</b><br/>Master Legislator: <i>Governance, Arm-Twisting, Vote-Counting, Keys to the Senate Cloakroom, Earmarks, [Secret Files]</i><br/>Texas Hill Country: <i>Born in Meager Circumstances, Johnson City, Barbecue, Oil Money, Southwest Texas State Teachers' College </i><br/>The Chief: <i>Big Man, Imposing, Arm-Clasping, Back-Slapping, Iron Gaze, Mean Streak, [Oval Office]</i><br/><br/><b>Keys</b><br/>Key of the Politician: <i>Hit this key when you pass a bill, defeat your political enemies or win an election.

The mercenaries tried to enter the country illegally, but were captured, tortured, and executed.<br/><br/>President Allende of Chile notified the White House that he had already commissioned an excavation of the area, and that the mummy was the property of the Chilean people. Frantic, the administration ordered Section Zero to retrieve the mummy at all costs, lest it wind up in the hands of the Soviets.<br/><br/>General Hiram West, head of SZ at the time, orchestrated a coup d'etat. On September 11, 1973, President Salvador Allende was overthrown in a US-backed military coup. Augusto Pinochet seized control of the government. However, when Section Zero troops finally located the ruins in the Atacama Desert, the mummy was gone. The ruins were clearly Inca in origin, and the writings found nearby indicated that the mummy was an entity known as a Lanshoi -- clearly a reference to the Lanshoi angel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379792/#Comment_379792" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T22:12:24+00:00" title="May 25, 2012 10:12PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Goal: Eat Cheese.

Apparently they were actually on their way to Habberat, and only stopped at Okkarn Pehak because they followed the Kose too far south before it rejoined the Great North-East Road.<br/><br/>Some of our words matched, but we mostly spoke in a pidgin Old Sarasinean (thank the Three Left Standing that we kept that tradition alive). We swapped tales of our respective Revered Ancestors, and were honored to create a dreamline from our village to theirs through the Closed Conscious.<br/><br/>I memorized their stories, and added their Revered to our list-of-knots:<br/><br/>Sakie<br/>Pashitur<br/>Ao <br/>Kevidjadj <br/>Tolan Te<br/>Djuk<br/>Brinnhadjam<br/>Leth Te<br/><br/>Speak their names. Good. The rest of you will all hear their stories soon.<br/><br/>I plan to escort Mathematical Supreme Spirit Hidj and the others to the enlightened capital Habberat tomorrow. I... Well, it's clear that their visit is one more of emergency than exploration and travel. Unfortunately, Sarasinean is failing us a little and I'm sure the lecturer-scholars at the Lyceum under Habberat will be able to assist. As far as I can tell, there is some kind of sickness or plague that originated in their capital of Coiur. They apparently are remote enough that it is not an immediate threat. However, by the dark glances and hushed whispers of Hidj and his close aide Drowning Moon Calendar Spirit Lekk, it must be some sort of problem of communication.<br/><br/>What we understood was:<br/><br/>A sickness created by "the greatest and last human kings of Coiur"?<br/>"They bear ten times the blood" was a term they kept repeating. This part was clear, but not the nuance in which they were using it.<br/>Sacrifice? No, Kheft, as far as I can tell this isn't a story of new sacrifice or some kind of shetani life-stealer. They were indicating that these greatest ones somehow had the... yeah, it's unclear to me as well, feel free to talk to them further later. The sickness may just allude to a problem with crops, like in our old sayings: "Tay'l" means both in both our words and Old Sarasinean.<br/><br/>Whatever it is, it is driving more shetani and lessers to their village and causing unrest in their area. We've created the dreamline, so our village is now the sister of theirs, our fates tied. We will do what we can to help. I need some to come with me to Habberat, and some to stay behind to harvest the closed conscious. <br/><br/>Hands?

The character possesses healing powers and can, through the laying on of hands alleviate and cure diseases and injuries. The ability takes its toll however:<br/>\u2022 The character may freely halt bleeding, relieve pain and heal simple fresh fractures.<br/>\u2022 In order to heal an old fracture that's healed incorrectly, cure minor ailments such as skin disorders and simpler diseases the character must pay one hit point*.<br/>\u2022 To heal injuries (restores 1d6 hit points for the receiver), or cure serious ailments such as pneumonia the character must pay two hit points.<br/>\u2022 In order to cure severe diseases that are normally considered incurable, such as plague or leprosy, the character must pay three hit points.<br/><br/>To use the heal someone takes time, at least 10-30 minutes depending on the severity of the disorder, and the character feels faint afterwards. A healer is almost completely immune to disease (always escapes infection from even the most communicable diseases at 2-6 on 1T6), but can not be healed by magic and must therefore heal all hit points naturally. Those who possess this ability are sometimes proclaimed to be saints, or burned at the stake.</blockquote>\n<i>* Charaters have 1d6+6 hit points, and they heal at a rate 1 per day if you've got the medieval Doctor House tending to your every need, 1 per week under basic medical care, 1 per 2 weeks if you just rest, and 1 per month if you're running around.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380009/#Comment_380009" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T20:00:12+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  8:00PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2012 8:00PM by Brian_Minter.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you are <b>exposed to the storms of Winter's King</b>, roll+CON.

But if I ever did make one, this would be part of it.<br/><br/>When you <b>become a vampire</b>, you gain a hunger score of 0, a humanity score of 6, and you and your sire get 3 bond with one another.<br/><br/>Hunger can go as low as -2, or as high as +3. Lower is better (for you and for everyone). Humanity goes from 6 down to 0, like a countdown clock. Higher is better.<br/><br/>As a hard move, the Storyteller can cause a PC to feel the urge to frenzy. (Good times to do this: When the vamp acts under fire when interacting with a mortal and misses; when the vamp hunts and misses; when the vamp goes aggro on a mortal or seizes by force from a mortal and misses; etc.)<br/><br/>Also, sunlight now counts as "harm as established". Maybe 1 wound for a few brief seconds' exposure, followed by annihilation.<br/><br/><b>Session start.</b> At the beginning of the first session, your hunger is 0. At the beginning of every session after the first, you gain +1 hunger.<br/><br/><b>Sense pulse.</b> Whenever you interact with a mortal while your hunger is +1 or greater, you act under fire. Whenever you smell the freshly shed blood of a living human being, no matter what your hunger score, you act under fire. (Usually, the fire is, do you feel the urge to frenzy?)<br/><br/><b>Frenzy.</b> When you feel the urge to frenzy, you can give into it, or you can resist it. When you resist it, roll+hunger. On a miss, you manage to compose yourself and remain in control of your faculties. On a 7-9, choose two. On a 10+, choose one.<ul><li>You do not kill a mortal.</li><li>You slake your thirst. Reduce your hunger to -2.</li><li>There are no witnesses. (Watch out for Masquerade breaches!)</li></ul>When you give into frenzy, the MC may choose one of the above, two, all three, or none.<br/><br/><b>The hunt.</b> When you hunt, roll+hot. On a hit, you find a suitable victim, and have the opportunity to feed. On a 7-9, you get -1 hunger. On a 10+, you get -3 hunger. In either case, the victim suffers 1 wound.<br/><br/>(I would also probably want some sort of move for growing a cult or following. I might use the hocus's <i>fortunes</i> move as a model, and it would cover the conceptual space of both Herd and Retainers.)<br/><br/><b>Blood bond.</b> When you drink the blood of another vampire, but do not kill it, it gains +1 bond on you. The vamp from whom you drink can choose to take a number of harm, and you reduce your hunger by the same amount.<br/><br/><b>Diablerie.</b> When you drink the blood of another vampire, and kill it in doing so, reset your hunger to -2, mark experience, and note that you are henceforth +tainted.<br/><br/>You can use the supernatural power of Vitae to <b>heal yourself</b>.

The Iron harp, or the black harp as it is also known. An instrument said to have been created during the reign of the druid king Aldroc.<br/><br/>In the songs the harp is used to put listeners to sleep, raise a fog so cunning warriors can sneak up on their enemies, and to win a heart in a case of unrequitted love.<br/><br/>What the songs don't say is that the black harp is just a harp made out of iron. There's nothing special about it at all apart from that. But just as the Sidhe can't handle iron objects, so does the music of the iron harp cause them discomfort or agony. Any Sidhe who hears the harp will come to it, hoping to make it stop. Whoever plays the harp can then negotiate for a favour from the Sidhe. How willing the Sidhe is to deal is decided by it's mood:<br/><br/>Mood (roll 2d6):<br/>2. Angry (might attack or punish the one who played the harp)<br/>3-5. Unwilling (demands a high price \u2013 a beloved memory, or an emotion perhaps)<br/>6-8. Neutral (willing to negotiate further)<br/>9-11. Amused (demands a low price \u2013 maybe a lock of hair, un unwanted memory, or an item the person values)<br/>12. Helpful (asks only an insignificant gift - a kiss, a trivial item, or a single strand of hair)<br/><br/>The probability that there is a Sidhe near for the iron harp to attract depends a lot on where you are. In cities, it is basically impossible, but in the wilderness \u2013 especially near pools of water \u2013 chances are better.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403367/#Comment_403367" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-10T17:22:50+00:00" title="January 10, 2013  5:22PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you cannot pick it up, for it was not meant for your hands, weep.<br/>So long as you have wept longer and harder than any others, you are the Kingmaker.<br/>As Kingmaker, you can discard a token to declare someone else its True Heir.<br/><br/>If you lose it in the wilderness, gain a token.<br/>Upon its recovery, you may elect to discard a token to give it +1 Fatal permanently.<br/><br/>If you kill its True Heir, you become its True Heir.<br/>At this time, Your Shadow may elect to discard a token to splinter away (with implications attendant).<br/><br/>It cannot be destroyed or contained by the contents of this world.<br/>If you destroy it, begin a new Chapter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403379/#Comment_403379" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-10T18:39:20+00:00" title="January 10, 2013  6:39PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If its not nailed down, I can take it.
