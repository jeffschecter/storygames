The latter does not require dice rolls for investigation so the game progresses much more quickly, or you might say it leaves more time for character interaction and development of the fiction.<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed is that players want their characters to be busy all the time. In RQ3, for example, if characters had any spare time at all, players would assign this to training so as to increase their skills. In Pendragon the winter season allowed no adventuring so players would engage in horse breeding to make money. I slowed this down by introducing tasks around the running of their estates such as court cases to be seen, dignateries to be entertained, children to be raised etc.<br/><br/>In a recent game of Trail which I set in an Asylum, instead of adapting to the rhythm of the place, players wanted to know what their characters were up to <b>all the time</b>, any spare time was spent trying to escape. The best way I've thought of for slowing this down is to change the characters' drive to something about "getting better" rather than escape at any cost. It's something of an imposition but it would make the roleplaying experience much richer.<br/><br/>Fiction doesn't happen all at once, or in an unremitting stream of actions. I think game developed fiction could be improved by slowing things down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_291744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291744/#Comment_291744" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T04:51:31+00:00" title="September  6, 2010  4:51AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2010 4:53AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>... there's a big difference in the way Call of Cthulhu and Trail of Cthulhu run.

They are GM-tools, and is largely focused on setting the tone and speed of dialogue.<br/><br/>Dialogue is a wonderful tool. Your voice works in very simple ways. By reinforcing it you may be a GM from hell (and heaven). Some examples from the top of my head:<br/><br/>Calm voice = calm dialogue = calm players -&gt; fits calm, reflective situations<br/><br/>Pitched voice = pitched dialogue = stressed players -&gt; fits critical situations<br/><br/>To slow down tempo: describe details, focus on relationships, make food an issue, maintenance, reflection and moral qualms<br/>To support slowing down tempo: use calm voice, give players ample time to ponder and take action, ask follow-up questions on what they do, how they do it, and if they take this and that into consideration, be caring and thoughtful<br/><br/>To speed things up: deliver effective descriptions, aim at intensity in interaction, press for conflict<br/>To support the change: be direct, clear affirmation of actions, matter-of-factly language, essential details, praise actions with direction, encourage pro-active stances (researching, guarding, bivouacking, investigating, etc.)<br/><br/>Critical mode: use wild mimics and gestures, hard eye-contact, short descriptions, demand concrete answers NOW (punish delays in answer with: "Your character hesitates! NO action!")<br/>To crash into the overdrive of a crisis: stand up, slap the table for effect, give the sergeant-yell, act mercilessly with NPCs, give instant consequences, go from player to player in frenetic tempo, blast them with critical situations<br/><br/>To end critical mode and kill the tempo: sit down, use tired, panting voice, talk slowly, rest your hands and slump your body<br/>To support drop-dead effect: give narrative and social affirmation of "crisis is over"; touch players, be empathic, smile, tell the players their characters are through it, lick their wounds, gather their wits, goes home ...<br/><br/>- and so on ...<br/><br/>You need a flexible and robust resolution-system to support this, simple enough for you to quicken resolution in critical mode. You may use it as slowly as you like in other modes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291799/#Comment_291799" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T14:20:20+00:00" title="September  6, 2010  2:20PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>I could see a really cool mechanic wherein people had a limited amount of real-world time to resolve a conflict (group conflict resolution).

It is challenging at first, but really reinforces the pulp action feel once you get the hang of it. <br/><br/>To give a short summary:<br/><br/>The scene is set and when a conflict arises, opposition dice are rolled and added to give a total that must be beaten with the PC dice. The player rolls dice and sets them all aside. A timer is set. The player puts forward a die and describes their action that will attempt to neutralize the conflict. The opposition then describes a compication that keeps the conflict going. The player then puts forward another die and describes an action, only to be countered by a complication by the opposition. This back and forth action-complication only ends when the action dice total exceeds the opposition total or the timer runs out. If the total of the action dice does not beat the opposition total, then other resources can be brought in or other players may help out. If they still can't beat the opposition total or the timer runs out, then the game experiences a complication that the whole group must overcome.<br/><br/>This style of play favors short narration until it is obvious that the conflict has been overcome, at which point there are rewards for extravagant narration. It reinforces the pulp action style of the game as well as the boastful, over the top style of the characters. It is quite fun, especially since it incorporates a drinking game in the game mechanics.

It has some merit. A lot of players find it very good to have this option, not the least due to the fact that they may choose to make unimportant conflicts in a hurry, and focus their game-play on the important ones. I like it!<br/><br/>In my own design I am working with the finale of really important conflicts being played out in great tempo, to simulate the real world tempo of it (as is often the case, but depending on the conflict, of course). By emulating the real world tempo I try to help the players "live" the conflict. I am not fond of players managing conflicts in a game-tactical manner, so I work with tools to keep the conflicts from going in that direction. Tempo and rhythm are very central in that work.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>The TSOY thing is kind of neat ... because if you're just smacking down a few orcs, boom, you can do it in one roll, but if you find yourself evenly- or over-matched you draw it out.</blockquote>Or; if you have a transitional conflict; one of lesser importance - you deal with it offhand ...<br/>- and the peak-conflicts, the important ones, are dealt with in ways that instill more energy and intensity in them.<br/><br/>One way of instilling energy is to go closer to the character with the conflict (the stakes), and then to reflect on it more (playing out the aftermath in greater detail). In some games there is more detail to be had in the aftermath, when the characters retell or relive their conflict in one or more reflective scenes, than in the actual conflict, which is played out in one, explosive scene. This is, of course, a bit more sophisticated way of narrating such conflicts (jumping back and forth in time, letting details coming after the conflict, feeding the reflection rather than the conflict-scene). Sometimes this is the perfect way of doing it, and sometimes you need a big, blasting conflict-scene, and no reflective aftermath ... only brutal consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_292000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292000/#Comment_292000" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T11:23:10+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 11:23AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2010 11:33AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Sometimes this is the perfect way of doing it, and sometimes you need a big, blasting conflict-scene, and no reflective aftermath ... only brutal consequences.</blockquote>But; on the whole people tend to do the "brutal" variant all too much, and forget about the aftermath as an option for reflection. So I am more inclined to talk about the reflective aftermath, with its <i>greater potential for showing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mental</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">social</span> consequences</i> of a conflict.<br/><br/>And that is one effect of working deliberately with tempo and rhythm too; you get an overall better balance between the physical, social and mental elements in the characters, as they get more chances to shine in different scenes. A slow scene, reflective in content, is a much better arena for mentalities to be developed. And homely scenes of friendship, family and love are the best arena for social skills and emotional bonding to emerge, and fill out the character.<br/><br/>You will most likely have more complex and "whole" characters in your campaign, if you let the tempo in each game-session go from reflective slowness, through homely conversation, and up through the layer of active preparation, towards the explosive finale ...<br/>- and then down again. Or varying the tempo, and changing it, in any order you deem beneficial to the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
