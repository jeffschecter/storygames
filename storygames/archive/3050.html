It was fun and illuminating, and I thought I'd tell y'all about it.<br/><br/>The gist of the game: <i>You're all Courtiers in the Palace of the Sultan. You live in luxury, but you also can't leave. To pass time, you tell stories, enabling you to get in all the subtle digs you don't dare come out and say regarding your little grudges and rivalries and petty ambitions.</i> So you're playing Courtiers telling stories, and whoever's Storytelling also "GMs" that story, casting the other Courtiers as the characters in the story, and at the end of each tale you check to see how the Courtiers' ambitions were advanced and such.<br/><br/>We had five players: Charles was facilitating and had a copy of the game rules, Serita and I had both read the rules online, April was coming to this game cold, and Annie, my Fiance, was new to roleplaying entirely. I've gamed with April a couple times before, and had previously met Charles, but that's about all the history I know of.<br/><br/>So 1001 Nights characters are described by the Five Senses, as broadly interpreted as you like (E.G. for Sight, anything from "My shining countenance is lovely to behold," to "I am blind to the motives of others"). Then you define an Envy toward another PC, and an Ambition stemming from that envy.<br/><br/>We had:<br/><br/><b>Nevita</b>, playing <b>Jalaizra the Perfumer</b>, lovely, refined, and ambitious. She envies the Water-boy his inconspicuousness, and her Ambition is to use him in a plot to kill the Sultana.<br/><br/><b>Charles</b>, playing <b>Hassim, the Food-taster</b>, beautiful and seductive, frustrated for he no longer enjoys the food he tastes. I don't remember his envy and ambition. Envies the Waterboy his simplicity, maybe?<br/><br/><b>April</b>, playing <b>Sidi the Water-boy</b>, simple and lowly. He envies the Food-taster for he is able to taste while the boy can only serve. I think his Ambition was to get promoted to higher station, maybe even the Taster's job.<br/><br/><b>Annie</b>, playing <b>Serit the Midwife</b>, a Bedouin, modest and dutiful. She envies the Perfumer her colorful extravagance, her Ambition, to humiliate Jalaizra before the Sultan and take her position.<br/><br/>. . .and <b>Myself</b>, playing <b>Cassim the Master of the Hunt</b>, Coarse and proud, handsome but rough and smelly. He envies the Food-taster his lovers, and his Ambition is for a woman to choose him over Hassim.<br/><br/><br/><i>Gameplay goes like this: The first storyteller sets up the story, all in-character-like, and casts the others in their roles, either all up front, or as they appear, or whatever. Then he kind of GMs the story along; you can take a varied amount of control--from just winding it up and watching the players go, to tightly narrating every transition and even internal motives about the characters. Everyone but the Gm gets to ask questions about where the story will go, like "Will the lover betray the peasant girl?" or "Will the Dancing girl get her freedom?" You stake a die ("Gem of the Sultan") out and when the question's answered, you roll it--odds go to the Gm, evens you keep. Doesn't matter if the question was answered yes or no, you're just investing <i>interest</i> in the story.</i><br/><br/>So: I began, in in Cassim's bellowy, declarative style: "I will tell you the <b>Tale of the Thrice-Foolish Lover</b>. You, Hassim, shall be the Lover, Midwife, you shall be the Dancing Girl, Waterboy, you shall be the Peasant Woman, and Perfumer, you shall play the Haughty Sultana." (I screwed up at this point--when casting the women, I was trying to be bluntly ironic with all of them, but I merely pointed instead of naming them, and I got them mixed up. Midwife as Dancer was fine, but I meant to cast the Perfumer as Peasant, and the lowly Waterboy as Sultana. Oh well.) I ran the story by leading up to a line suggestive of a course of action, then cutting off and waiting for response: "And so the Lover, having been driven from his village, came to the great city, where he espied a Dancing Girl of surpassing beauty and grace. After her performance, he approached her." Then I'd let the respective actors do their thing until a transition was called for, and break in: "And so the Lover set off to find work that he might earn the Dancer's freedom." Worked pretty well. There was a bit of "Oh, um, should we say something here?" pause, but not bad.<br/><br/>So Annie had her Midwife play the Dancer tragically (I clarified that she danced at a brothel, and everyone was like, "Oh, <i>that</i> kind of dancer"), having been slold into slavery and forced to this wretched life. Which was pretty much perfect. On the way to look for work to buy her freedom, the Lover met the peasant girl, scrounging for food. He smooth-talks her just like the dancer, learns from her that there may be work at such and such place, and suddenly has <i>another</i> girly on the line to spend his Shekels on. Going to the merchant for work, he meets the Sultana, who takes a liking to him and his strapping bod, and invites him to work in the Palace wink, wink). So he spends his last night of freedom continuing to string along both his girls, with much misunderstanding, coincidence and just plain lying.<br/><br/>He comes to the Palace and the Sultana sets him to work in the garden. . .he tries to climb the wall to visit his girlies, but the Guard Captain catches him and pulls him down, and for his betrayal and ingratitude to the generous Sultana--he is  beheaded. I felt the story had dragged on quite a while; we were all having fun just "playing out" each scene and adding complications, but once the Lover had met with all his Three Follies and suitable closure was possible, I felt it was time to end it so others could tell some stories.<br/><br/>One thing that strikes me about the tale, it was a bit long and rambly, but still for all that had a nice, satisfying structure to it that wouldn't necessarily come about in other roleplaying contexts. We <i>knew</i> right from the start that there would be three Lovers' Follies, so every woman that the Lover met, Charles and whoever his co-star was made sure to take the story in that direction. The Dancing Girl and Sultana were obvious romantic hooks for a ladykiller character, but the Peasant Woman had no real cue to forge a romantic link with the guy other than <i>that's what the story was about</i>, and the players may well have not done that without that cue. Which would be a perfectly fine way for an RPG to go, but in this case it felt really satisfying for the story to have a nice, symmetrical, "classic" feel.<br/><br/>This is getting pretty long, so I think I'll cut myself off at this point and let it simmer; feel free to comment and I'll make separate posts for our other two tales (and the Court scenes in between) later. Thanks, Meg, for a super-fun game and for being a part of introducing my Fiance to roleplaying!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS I realized after the fact that I pretty much duplicated the romantic rivalry of two characters in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19908.0" rel="nofollow">Vincent Baker's old playtest report</a>, which I'd read just prior to play. It was mostly unconscious, but there it is; hell, it was tons of fun and I regret nothing! Just wanted to give credit where it's due. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69726/#Comment_69726" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T12:52:36+00:00" title="May 16, 2007 12:52PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!

These should be shoter than the OP, since the stories themselves were briefer and there's less explaining to do.<br/><br/>Now, then, Court Scenes:<br/><br/><i>When the story concludes (the interest invested guides the plot, since you've got to address all the questions people have raised), everyone splits the Gems they've accumulated between three interests and rolls 'em. At least one Even rolled in "Safety" means you <i>didn't</i> incur the Sultan's wrath (three strikes and you're beheaded). Any Evens you roll in "Ambition" or "Freedom" advance that goal; Ambition being your goal within the court and Freedom being release <i>from</i> the court. Takes 5 to get your ambition and 7 to gain your freedom. After these have been rolled for everyone you narrate the results (how an ambition was furthered, how you gained the Sultan's displeasure), then go to another story, told by the player with the least Gems. You play until one person gets the axe, their ambition or their freedom, narrate that outcome, then do epilogues for the other characters.</i><br/><br/>For our first Court scene, nobody lost Safety, so no Sultan's displeasure--just a bit of furthering agendas and freedoms for mostly everyone. The Perfumer gets on the good side of the Waterboy to use him to deliver poison to the Sultana (or was it the Sultan's new wife and current favorite? I can't remember), and now has to cozy up to the rest of us as her intricate plan requires everyone's help. The Hunter and Food-Taster begin a rivalry for the affections of the new wife, as she has been enjoying the Taster's affections on the sly (and may even be pregnant with his child!), while the Midwife forges a bond with friendship with the wife as she cares for her in her pregnancy.<br/><br/>Nevita had to leave at this point (told ya my tale went too long!) so we were down to four players. The next tale (which goes to the player with the least dice from last time) was Charles' (as the Food-Taster): <b>"The Tale of the Bandit and the Crocodile."</b> The Midwife was the Bandit, the Waterboy the Singing Harp stolen from the palace, and the Huntmaster was, of course, the Crocodile--the ugly, hideous, snaggle-tothed, foul-breathed crocodile.<br/><br/>Simple set-up: bandit is fleeing with the Harp (who is quite unhelpful--"We're over heeeeere!" she constantly sings out.) with guards in hot pursuit, comes to the river where he (actually, we never specified gender, and the role was played by a woman. I guess I just keep thinking "Ali Baba" and "Aladdin") encounters the Crocodile, whose help (s)he needs to cross the river and escape.<br/><br/>I did a nice, slow grumpy crocodile voice, like a malicious Treebeard: "What is that noisome and shiny thing upon your back? I like it not." But! Charles did an interesting thing. He narrated: "But the crocodile was lying, for he secretly cherished the sound of music, and began then to conspire how to obtain the harp for himself." This was fascinating! In my tale, as GM I constrained <i>action</i>; I said things like "And so the Lover set off for the Sultan's palace. But I left characters' heads alone. Here Charles didn't trod on what anything was <i>doing</i>, but he freely issued decrees regarding what they were <i>thinking.</i> And it worked out great. The story was shaping up to be a "Fox and the Scorpion" (Or Gingerbread man) kind of deal, but now there were competing ambitions and all sorts of complications. Neat!<br/><br/>So the Croc gives a ride to the thief, and makes up a story about a better spot upriver to unload them so he can swim by the den of a lady croc and woo her with the harp's song. The Thief is thinking on his feet and makes a bold bluff about being a powerful wizard, so the Croc won't eat him. Well, it turns out the she-crocodile can't <i>stand</i> the harp-music, but is pleased that I brought her a tasty snack. I make like that was my plan all along, and let her devour the thief while I try to swallow the harp. And then Charles finishes: "In clamping his jaws on the harp, the crocodile snapped a string which cut in his mouth. Thus wounded,  his blood attracted the lady crocodile who devoured him in a feeding frenzy. The end."<br/><br/>One thing about this story: Annie was a bit paralyzed as the Bandit. She got caught up in this mindset of "how do I, the character, get out of this alive?" and all her energies were put to that purpose. And since the situation was so seemingly hopeless, she got a little panicky. And couldn't think of any questions to ask for dice, being so occupied. Whereas I, as one of the chief providers of her adversity, was caught up in this freedom to take the story anywhere without fear of "wrecking it," based on, e.g. Mike Holmes' "Make Failure Interesting" wrt Heroquest. To me there was a twin freedom in the fact that A) nobody HAS to die no matter how bleak it looks, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> it won't ruin anything if the character dies anyway. But to Annie it was just paralyzing. She did well, though, bluffing her way along as the "Sorceror," pretending to cast spells with flash powder, etc. But it meant practically nil dice by the time we were done.<br/><br/><i>Court scene:</i> Well, my reccollection is a bit hazy, but I believe Annie for having very few dice nonetheless rolled well toward her ambition. She might have gained the Sultan's displeasure, though; I know someone did. (Interesting, our Sultan was a real placid and likeable fellow, all "you know, I hate to even bring this up, but I really need you to attend more to your duties," like. You got the impression that if he did have to behead one of us, he'd feel just <i>awful</i>.) I made some gains in Freedom, and narrated that as the Sultan's pregnant wife hearing the tale of the Crocodile and being fascinated with such an exotic beast; Cassim is able to bend her ear about his longing to go abroad and hunt such animals in the Sultan's name. (Actually, I'm starting to wonder if it wasn't the Sultana that Cassim and Hassim were competing for, not the pregnant wife? Damn fuzzy memory.)<br/><br/>Well, one more tale (the shortest to recount, I hope) to go!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70087/#Comment_70087" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T15:29:56+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  3:29PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All right, last tale, plus analysis.<br/><br/>Annie told the third story, having the least dice from the previous round. She set the storytelling in the chambers of the new wife, now great with child, immoble, and welcoming of company and cheer. So Serit told a comedic tale, entitled "Something smells funny," about a Perfumer's attempts to create the perfect fragrance for a young Prince's wedding. Cassim the Huntsman was the Perfumer, and Hassim the Taster his assistant. I took a tack of gross parody--shrill-voiced, limp-wristed, and generally clueless and flitty--with the tact and grace that only Cassim could muster (heh heh). So the Hunter took his digs at at those who do useless and extravagant things for a living, and the Taster took his at those who smell of animal fat and musk ox sweat, rising in a shrill crescendo (at least in the perfumer's case). April added an element of sex farce with the impressionable Prince seeking the obviously worldy-wise assistant's advice on what to do on his wedding night ("Well, let me <i>show</i> you. . ."). great fun all around, the Wedding Fragrance is a disaster, the Perfumer is beheaded, and the Prince receives quite an education.<br/><br/>I was starting to get a bit frantic to accumulate dice here, since I had a shot, though a long one, at winning Cassim's Freedom. I tried and tried, but ended up shy of the amount of dice I would need to even have a chance this round. I ended up two away. Annie, meanwhile, met with great success and won her ambition! So it went down like: "The Sultan hears the riotous performance of Cassim as the Perfumer and realizes there is no need for such a superfluous position--not when the Midwife, who has just delivered his new child, is such a master of herbs and potions of all kinds! So the Midwife is honored with the position of Royal Herbologist, while the Perfumer is demoted to a menial and humiliating position." And for my almost-freedom: "the Sultan takes Cassim aside and informs him--gently! He's such a nice Sultan--that he values the hunter's services but he has been too familiar with his women of late--first the Sultana, and now his newest wife! Therefore, to remove such a tempation from his path, the Sultan will generously allow him his fondest wish--to hunt twice the lands around the Sultan's palace, as long as his waking moments will allow him. And so Cassim never found love, and never was allowed to venture off in search of exi\\otic prey, hunting the Sultan's estate for the rest of his days."<br/><br/>Re-reading the text afterwards, I think we screwed up on the dice--it says to keep all the odds you roll for the next round, but we were starting fresh each Tale with three dice. Also, there's a mechanic where the Storyteller can grab a die and roll it on arbitrary parameters ("OK, 1-4 he catches her, 5-11 he doesn't, 12 she catches HIM") to resolve an event. I made amble use of this in my story, kind of test driving all the mechancis available. Sometimes it did resolve an issue where I was attracted to more than one outcome; others I found myself thinking, "AWW, I kinda wish X had happened instead." The other Storytellers ignored this rules option and their tales went just fine. It was a bit of a letdown to resolve the Humiliation of the Perfumer without that player present. But what can ya do? Hopefully someone that knows her wil relate what happened at least.<br/><br/>But enough of that; now to the <i>obviously</i> most important element in this play report: <b>How did my fiance enjoy it?</b> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Well, judging from at-the-time, on the spot fun--she enjoyed it quite a lot. She talked, she laughed, she had inspired moments of acting or narration, she grooved on those same moments of others, she bonded quite quickly with a bunch of strangers. It was great.<br/><br/>She also had a lot to say after the fact. Her biggest impression was that while she did enjoy both the game itself and the stories created, she felt it was rather abrupt--in the sense that she was just getting to know the characters, and already their stories are ended. She said she'd probably find a longer-term development where you get to settle in to the characters and plot, at least for a <i>few</i> sessions, ultimately more satisfying.<br/><br/>We also had a bit of a talk about capital-s <i>Story </i>itself the other day. . .I was trying to relate some forum discussion stuff about using RPGs to creat Story. Annie remarked that she wouldn't really call what we produced in 1001 Nights a good story. . .I disagreed, and we discussed it. Turns out she means that the story produced has a really rough form--it's not up to prose fiction or screenplay-level of polish--and so in that sense not "good." My own position is that we <i>did</i> produce a good story in the sense that it had all the themes, conflict, and satisfying resolution of a good story even if the form is rough. I think Annie agrees with me on that level, but if she wishes to correct, clarify or expand on anything, she just might drop in herself to do it.<br/><br/>So thanks again, Meg! You've got a great game, and you've helped make a special shared experience possible!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS: Sorry if the length is off-putting to anyone. . .I really lack the skill to summarize.

It makes me want to relate <i>everything</i> that happened in the session. Most games don't do that ("and then we spent a couple of minutes subtracting the defense roll fropm the attack, and trying to remember what the rules for dodging firearms were. . .").<br/><br/>To be fair, we did have a couple of "wait, what are the rules on this?" moments, but they were few and quickly dispatched.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meguey</cite>If you want to keep playing these characters, just adjust the Ambitions and Envies to meet the new conditions, and go on.

The standard procedure is of course to narrate epilogues for all the non-dead, non-free folks, but it's easy enough not to. It does rob you of endings like "And he never left the palace again," though that can be saolved by choosing an ending point--"OK, <i>this</i> session is the final chapter; your character's fate is final."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meguey</cite>Also, some of the Stories are more polished than others.

Everyone was fairly formal, flowery, and "Arabian-ish," with occasional exceptional moments. I also come from a long RPG-playing background, so I think my standards may be different than Annie's-compared to my usual fare, this session was the frikkin' Rubiyat.<br/><br/>Thanks again!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
