I am hoping to do this in a way that lets the players decide who the betrayer is if there is one at all. I know that some games like Wilderness of Mirrors already has mechanics for this sort of thing in place, but I am more looking for a stand-alone technique for use in a traditional game or two.<br/><br/>What techniques are out there/have you seen used?<br/><br/>Right now, I am thinking of making the pregens with a pecking order for betrayal. The player who choses the pregen on the top of the "betrayal" order gets a card that lets them opt to be a traitor. If they choose yes, I either or both:<br/>1) give them more info on who their contact is and the nature of their betrayal, or<br/>2) give them the option to narrate their own<br/><br/>The later sounds more interesting, but the Con situation may make it a little less practical if I try to keep the presence of the betrayer secret from the rest of the group.<br/><br/>If the first player decides not to be a betrayer, they get a consolation... the player now knows there will be a betrayer; give that player a reason that their character suspects there is a traitor.<br/><br/>So what do you think? Any other games that do things like this, and con experiences like this, or any further ideas along these lines?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127301/#Comment_127301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T10:25:06+00:00" title="February 18, 2008 10:25AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2008 10:28AM by Remi.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Mountain Witch is custom-built for exactly this kind of play. You give people 'Trust' tokens, which are effective when used against GM opposition, but are even more effective when used against the Trust giver (becoming 'Betrayal' tokens in the process). This, combined with the Dark Fate cards (hidden cards with a dark secret for each character), pushes the players towards betrayal. The pressure to just go, "Ah screw it, I'm betraying you all to get what I want," is really high, and the decision to stay loyal to your comrades is a moral choice in the most wonderful sense.<br/><br/>This is great because betrayal happens as a result of the way the game is set up and through events in the game. No one is 'The Betrayer' at the beginning, but everyone has the potential to be one.<br/><br/>tMW is a fantastic game.

Is this merely a matter of the character isn't actually betrayer until the moment that the opportunity arises in game, or that the character is retroactively revealed to be a traitor?<br/><br/>Because if the latter, that's REALLY what I am looking for. (What inspired this was 24 Season 1. Sarah Clarke didn't know her character Nina Meyers was a mole until like 5 episodes from the end, but within the mileu of the show, the CHARACTER was a traitor since the beginning.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127303/#Comment_127303" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T10:42:28+00:00" title="February 18, 2008 10:42AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You choose to betray and earn a hefty mechanical reward for the betrayal in The Mountain Witch.

Have everyone secretly write down on an index card (with their name on it) "yes" or "no," then collect them all.  If there are more than one "yes," pick one (or more!) to be a betrayer.  If there aren't any yeses, there's no betrayer, but don't tell anyone that.

Sometimes stuff can just pile up against a character enough to make them turn (they're made an offer, or their need is ignored, or what have you) or they have a Dark Fate card that, when revealed, puts their actions in clear context as a Betrayer all along. Since the player knew they had that Dark Fate, though, it's not like it's a surprise to _them_, they just had a motive that they were working with, hidden from the other players.<br/><br/>Also, all of this is out in the open. People are giving each other Trust tokens and they know it has the potential to fuel betrayal in the future. Everyone has a Dark Fate card, so the players are watching each other, waiting for the Big Reveal. It's great for a certain kind of betrayal, but it's not always "OMG! YOU WERE THE TRAITOR ALL ALONG SYSTEMATICALLY SELLING US OUT" kind of betrayal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127309/#Comment_127309" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T11:07:15+00:00" title="February 18, 2008 11:07AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, I'm getting an idea for a system based on Jason and Willow's posts.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I am interested in putting it to a public vote whether there is a traitor.<br/><br/>Perhaps at the outset, triggered by an event in the game, the player answers two questions secret ballot style:<br/>1) Who if the traitor, if not you? (Perhaps phrase this allowing the player to narrate and/or describe why the character thinks this.)<br/>2) Do you want to be the traitor?<br/><br/>If the player voted as the traitor has declined to play a traitor, there is no traitor. But you still have the reasons that they suspect each other.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the "winner" of the secret lottery becomes the traitor. Everyone receives a secret card saying either that they are not the traitor, or are given a card with their MO or previously unrevealed actions they took that they now have to guard against.<br/><br/>Hmmm. Nice first draft; perhaps to keep the secret ballot from making the game into an early defusing, also add a question #3: which character do you trust or (regardless of trust) act to defend? (e.g., a relative, a secret relationship, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127310/#Comment_127310" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T11:16:31+00:00" title="February 18, 2008 11:16AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar Slaad</cite>I'm not sure I am interested in putting it to a public vote whether there is a traitor.</blockquote>\nI was suggesting that everybody vote on who the traitor is going to be.<br/><br/>I like Willow's idea, too, if everybody has a powerful motive for betrayal and they get to choose.
