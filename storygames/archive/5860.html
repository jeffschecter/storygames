You know how cool they can be in movies, comics and books? How they make you forget to breathe and perhaps even your heart beat a little faster. How, for instance, a fight in Usagu Yojimbo can be over in just three frames? Or take up several pages?<br/>But - both of us admitted to struggling to make fights similarly spectacular and exciting in rpgs. Often, they seem repetitious and sort of stale - like a glimpse of old-skool d&amp;d but without all the excitement from playing with a new toy. <br/>So - does anyone here have any great advise or tricks to make fights more interesting? Preferably something that's usable for any system but references to specific system are of course cool. Oh, and I don't really want to hear "No, I haven't had this experience!" If so - cool for you! Instead - please share how you run fights!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131119/#Comment_131119" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T04:47:23+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  4:47AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Peter, the best fights I can recall are all about things that really matter to the players.<br/><br/>I had a fantastic fight last night, and it went down like this:  I had to choose between abandoning a young woman to a horde of zombies or put myself - and my friends - into extreme danger for a stranger.  I made my choice - abandon her! - and she obviously did not want to be abandoned.  And the zombies did not want us to close the door between us and them.  So she and the zombies were actively working against me.  This was cool because my character has the Key of Not Caring About People, and this sorely tested it.  Everyone watched in stunned horror as I pushed this screaming woman out into certain death so we could get the door shut.  Now win or lose, that made a great conflict.  It said something about my guy, everyone cared about the outcome (I even got a bonus die from somebody), it was fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert" title="jbuchert"><img alt="jbuchert" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert">jbuchert</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131120/#Comment_131120" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T04:58:54+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  4:58AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few things pop to my mind.<br/><br/>First off, make them meaningful. A totally random encounter isn't usually very interesting because it's .. well, random and disconnected. Make the fights about something. Look at flags on characters and fire on all cylinders, embed meaningful moral issues into the fights, press the players' emotional buttons, etc. Anything to make the combat more meaningful. I think this is the most crucial element.<br/><br/>Second, don't neglect the terrain and environment part of the equation. Make the surroundings interesting, in the sense that it challenges the players and their characters. Especially in crunchy combat heavy games usually the players know exactly what to do and when, so use the terrain and the situation to mix that up by making some things impossible, other thing difficult and some entirely new things possible. A fight on the roof of a moving train, where the players need to duck every other round or hit an overhanging object? Sure! How about a fight on a crumbling half-built skyscraper, with structural beams falling off as things progress? Sounds good.<br/><br/>Lastly - and at the risk of sounding obvious - be descriptive and encourage the same from the players (maybe via game mechanical bonuses). This ties into the above as well. If you created some interesting terrain, make sure to communicate it evocatively - if you're fighting in a room with whirring blade-traps and clunking death machines, all swinging and snapping beside their ears, make sure they feel it. Also, sometimes a game (such as Shadowrun) severely limits what a player can do in his turn (things like "you can say only 3 words"), which usually ends up hurting description far more than it limits their min-maxed game-play options. I usually throw out such limitations out of the window and allow them considerable leeway in description, either on their own turn or indeed to shout some warnings or comments on other people's turns (and I do the same with NPCs). It makes things less routine, more interesting, more hectic, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131123/#Comment_131123" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T05:21:16+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  5:21AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (stupid browser ate this post TWICE, and in the intervening time some of what I said has already been said by other people.  But my patience is too strained to edit it now, so please pardon the repetition.)<br/><br/>This is kind of obvious, but I'll throw it in anyway -- some of the most exciting and memorable fights are the ones where the stakes are interesting.  And just to make it clear, life-or-death stakes are actually pretty dull when it comes right down to it.  (Seriously...a win doesn't automatically lead to anything cooler than what you had before you started the fight, and a loss ends the game.  Who's supposed to get excited about THAT?)  Some games (I'm thinking here of <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> in particular) seem to do a really great job of putting interesting stakes front-and-center in a conflict; other games can require more effort.<br/><br/>So a great fight scene should have something great to drive it, something that really clicks with everyone.  Maybe it's defeating an annoying arch-nemesis, maybe it's rescuing a loved one, maybe it's conquering some inner demons, maybe it's making a billion dollars and sleeping with supermodels.  Whatever prize is most appealing is going to be the one that can take even a simple "I punch you and then you punch me" struggle right over the top.<br/><br/>Great fight scenes typically have a great location, too.  It doesn't necessarily have to be a stunting paradise a la <i>Feng Shui</i>, but it should have some features that everyone can interact with.  Things like restricted lines of movement, for example, or dangerous areas to avoid/shove your opponent into (this is why a swordfight on top of a zeppelin is always a winner, especially if there are spinning propellers involved).  If it makes sense for an object to be there, it should be there, even if it's something no one mentioned in the original description.  And that description should be evocative, but simple enough that everyone can picture it without needing ten minutes of heavy narration.<br/><br/>In crunchy games, a good fight scene really lets you dig in with the mechanics of the game -- so a great d20 fight scene should give people reasons to make interesting skill checks, the opportunity to use their weirdo feats and talents, and enough space to cut loose with crazy powers.  Limiting the tactical options available to the characters doesn't always preclude having a great fight, but I've always felt it's something that should only be done sparingly...otherwise, why even bother with a system that includes those options in the first place?<br/><br/>A lot of great fight scenes I've been part of have had a moment of choice -- do you save the hostage, or chase down your enemy?  Do you accept their surrender, or take your revenge?  Do you step through the mirror, or smash it?  Do you grab the cleric and retreat, or do you fight to the bitter end?  It's that simple little moment when all the sound and fury of the combat drops away and you actually feel a little bit of anguish over whether the decision you are about to make is the right one that tells you "holy shit, this fight is BIG."  If you're the one running the fight, it totally pays off to look for those choices and bring them out, and to know when to slam on the brakes so that people can appreciate the gravity of it.  (And, of course, when to lean on them to CHOOSE NOW, to keep the tension high.)<br/><br/>This is obviously not a complete list, YMMV, all sales final, etc. -- but maybe you'll like some of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131129/#Comment_131129" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T05:55:15+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  5:55AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to echo some earlier comments. I think terrain plays a HUGE role in good fights, and often is overlooked in rpgs. I'm really interested in The Red Box Hack in part because it uses different arenas to give fights a different feel both story-wise and mechanically (I'm still learning the game so forgive me if I get anything wrong when talking about it).<br/><br/>Think about the fights in the first Lord of the Rings movie, down in the dwarven strongholds, how characters were dodging around pillars, securing doors, smashing coffins. The scene with the crumbling bridge was in part awesome because the bridge was working against the heroes. <br/><br/>For me that can really be hard to pull of in an rpg fight scene, in part because the way I view the terrain might differ from the way the players see it. I tend to like games where players can lay down tokens or hero points or what have you to change terrain features, like a super hero game where a player can say "I rip open a nearby fire hydrant (lays down token/point) to spray a jet of water at the flaming villain." <br/><br/>I've played waaayyy too many D&amp;D style games, some with or without miniatures, where the characters and villains/monsters engage one another and just stand there trading blows. Thats not to say I haven't had exciting, mobile combat while playing D&amp;D, just that the combat system seems to lend itself to that kind of static grinding.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

This is a very different experience from what can be acchieved through voice or text only. A classic example is the end sequence of Lord of the Rings I, the battle with the Balrog. The script said something like "They run". The final sequence with falling stairs, flying arrows etc. was created by the special effects people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing that *can* be used to add tension when story gaming action, is of course to include difficult character choices into the sequence (as said by many above). My advice is: let one player do the narration, skip most of the filler stuff, and get to the choice points and the resolution quickly. Especially, avoid draws and stand-offs, they tend to block creativity. If you can't make a strong raise, cross cut to another scene or jump forward in time, even to the point of leaving the outcome open.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more action, go for gamism or simulationism. Dice rolling, 100% character ownership and random character death as an option bring that tension into the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131190/#Comment_131190" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T09:31:01+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  9:31AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the thing: losing hit points is boring. Rolling damage so the other guy loses hit points is boring.  Rolling attack after attack and defense after defense, all so a number can creep towards zero, is boring.  You can mitigate this somewhat, which is what the "be descriptive!" thing boils down to for me, but if at the end of the day you're still whittling a guy's Number of Badassery down to 0, I'm yawning no matter how cool you look doing it.<br/><br/>Go back and watch those cool fight scenes.  They are not about losing hit points.  In fact, usually the fight is just a complication to some other thing -- the protagonist is trying to get through a defensive line to a place of safety (or the big red button), or trying to get non-combatants out of a dangerous area unhurt, or trying to convince his opponent to switch loyalties, or trying to prove his own mettle, or any one of a thousand things.  The fight is rarely about the fight!<br/><br/>It may be hard, however, to find a game system that does not drag everyone's attention back to killing everybody who stands in their way.  The wargaming roots are strong, and while they may make for an awesome wargame, they often make for shitty fight scenes.  One of the things that I always look for is a game that, while it may have hit points and dodge rolls, still allows space for something else.  <em>Dogs</em> immediately springs to mind; <em>TSOY</em> is explicitly about this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131191/#Comment_131191" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T09:32:52+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  9:32AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frederik J.

Unless your hit points are what keeps you alive, and lets you keep everything you've earned in the game. Unless you don't know whats going to come next. Unless you don't know if your line of escape could easily get cut off, and the resources you so carefully managed to stay in the safe zone are now totally fucked and you're going to die and have to start over at level 1. <br/><br/>Seriously, playing nice and having fights that won't actually kill your fucking character fucking dead are a great way to destroy the thrill of the fight in a gamist game. JBR is right about the wargaming roots and how it fucks up other styles, but I also think the other styles have fucked up the wargaming roots. Wanting to keep PCs alive and see them win, even when they don't deserve it, is a fast track to boring. <br/><br/>It isn't the same kind of excitement as a movie, but as its a different medium, I don't think that's always a bad thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131235/#Comment_131235" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T11:01:56+00:00" title="February 28, 2008 11:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, look at a modern-setting movie like Die Hard. He is beaten and bloodied by the end of the movie, and half the fun of that movie is seeing him take damage and keep going. I think in some situations hit points can reflect that, but again, too many games by default treat it as a grind. I mean, I used to describe characters taking damage and its effects, then give the "hit point cost" of the attack, but that was really outside the mechanics of the game.

If you're interesting in recreating the feel of movie fights, it's important to recognize that most American action movies are really different from the Bruce Lee / Shaw Brothers tradition, which is, in turn, pretty different from the Yuan Brothers / Tony Ching tradition, which is pretty different from Japanese samurai films, which is pretty different from the awesome shit Jeff Imada put together for <i>The Bourne Ultimatum</i>, which is pretty different than what they did in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.  Personally, I find it really hard to talk about "what makes a good fight" unless I know what kind of fight you're trying to go for.  Different kinds of fights require different elements.<br/><br/>One weakness I think many American movies and games have is in CLARITY and PACING.  In some of my favorite fight scenes, like those by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0950759/" rel="nofollow">Yuan Heping</a> or the big fight in <i>Bourne Ultimatum</i>, there is never a shot within which nothing happens, but the blows are not relentless, an endless flurry of punches and kicks.  Things happen.  Someone gets knocked down and has to get back up, strengthening their determination or showing a sign of weakness.  Each section of the fight is punctuated by a change in the emotional or physical status of one of the characters, so the audience knows which way the fight is going.  Also, the physical actions within the fight are not murky or too quick to really follow.  Rather, even if the camera is shakey (as in the <i>Bourne 3</i> fight) or cuts quickly between a variety of different angles (like in a Yuan Heping fight), the choreographer ensures that the audience can tell exactly what is going on. This makes the actions of the characters meaningful and significant, instead of seeming to be so much flailing.  I think both of these can be replicated in roleplaying, but it takes some practice and skill.  I don't think I'm particularly good at it, but I don't think most game systems do a good job of supporting that kind of fight.<br/><br/>Best systems for these kinds of fights: <i>The Riddle of Steel</i> and <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>.  If someone could combine the speed and attention to fight detail that <i>Riddle</i> has with the back-and-forth, give-and-take of <i>Dogs</i> conflicts, with escalation and bringing in reserve traits and all that, I would play the shit out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131259/#Comment_131259" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T11:49:35+00:00" title="February 28, 2008 11:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 11:50AM by Tristan.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, I want to point out that, even as a narrativist player and GM, I (and the groups I use to play with) like crunchy games.<br/><br/><br/>It might sound controversial, but my personal opinion as a GM is that sometimes using miniatures and stuff can improve the dynamics in a fight (at least mechanically speaking).<br/><br/>I try to describe things as deeply as possible, and try to encourage cinematics and tactical thinking (as opposed to "just stand there trading blows"). And for the players to get a broader picture of the terrain, drawing it for them seems to help. Seeing how close the troll is to the cliff uses to make them realize they can actually attempt to trip him. Seeing a badly drawn table sometimes does make them jump into the table to get the higher ground. Watching how the monsters are located in a straight line makes them realize a nice lighting bolt would cause a nice effect...<br/><br/>I use the rules (and the pertinent house rule if needed) to cover as much of those tactics as possible without slowing down the games, but I usually try to make them think outside of the box...<br/><br/>And in my experience, not using miniatures (or any mean to visually represent the fight) tends to encourage the "just stand there trading blows" phenomena. Descriptions help, but they seem more like a tool than the only thing I'd need.<br/><br/><br/>A funny thing I noticed regarding hit points... Some times they bring some drama to the scene... Most of the times they do not. And I have found that as a player I like them. They help me measure how much risk I'm willing to take, how enduring my character is, and how badass my swordplay is. As a GM I hate them. They feel like a mechanical and limited resource, many times making me wish I could make the players do some more damage, just to shorten the agony. I try to give in as much description and drama as possible, but hp are usually more of a hindrance than a help for me.<br/><br/>I'm still looking for a midpoint kind of mechanic. Not as freeform as in most Story Games, not as crunchy and convoluted in most Trad Games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Especially in the moment.  Brand, I get that there are very broad, very hard-hitting consequences tied up to that -- but they are removed consequences.  They are not in the moment consequences, and I don't find them very suspenseful during a fight.  After and before a fight, yes.  During, not so much.<br/><br/>Matt clarified in a whisper (and Matt, feel free to unwhisper that) that what he meant is that folks often forget that hit points often have consequences beyond "the monster/character dies."  Getting that troll key, for instance.  Which is great and all, except when hit points are the only reliable metric to track those consequences.  The key here for me is reliable.  I have a pickpocketing rogue; I can get the key -- maybe.  If the GM decides I'm close enough / hidden enough / clever enough to even make the attempt.  If I can't rely on either always being able to make the attempt, or always being able to set up the circumstances in order to make the attempt <em>in the same way</em> that I'm always able to rely on the fact that I can hit the troll in the face until he dies, then I am highly, highly skeptical of those alternative methods.  Frankly, it makes me doubt that they are real options, and makes me wonder if the GM will just make me fight his troll that he worked so hard to make a combat monster.  I'm actually a little disturbed by a game where the only reliable way to make something happen is to kill things.  What does that say about the players who take up that mindset to play?<br/><br/>As Michael points out, you can have <em>stuff happen</em> that might be able to be quantified onto that hit point track, but really, why go to that level of abstraction?  If we're talking Die Hard, then hell -- I want my fight rules to allow me to blow out the windows and force the other character to cut up the bottoms of his feet for the rest of the movie.  If I have to choose between dealing 14 points of damage and giving the character a real injury with lasting consequences, I'm going to go for the real injury with consequences every time.<br/><br/>To put it another way: I play WoW.  Like, more than is probably healthy.  And in WoW, I play in the PvP battlegrounds a lot.  I play a hunter, and I've found that the most effective thing I can do in capture the flag is not shooting the flag carrier with the super-damage shot, and not to shoot him with the poison arrow that does damage over time.  It's to shoot him with the arrow that does NO DAMAGE but slows him down.  Other times, it's to shoot him with the arrow that knocks out one of his buffs.  I don't play rogue, but let me tell you, they have this ability called Distract which makes you turn around in a different direction.  Most annoying ability ever, and hugely effective.  I've got the flag, and I'm running towards my base... what the hell, now I'm running away from my base?<br/><br/>For my money, you make a fight interesting by making the things you do in a fight interesting.  You don't make it about some long-term, abstract, lose-my-time-investment thing.  You don't shackle all the actually interesting stuff to piddling away a pool of hit points.  You want to stop a guy before he hits the big red button?  Then make it about stopping him, not reducing his hit points to 0 before he gets to the button.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131293/#Comment_131293" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T13:01:29+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  1:01PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On hit points, I always think about Dogs, and fallout.  That's a form of interesting "hit point loss", from my point of view.  And it's interesting in two ways...<br/><br/>First, when you look down at that building stack of fallout, waiting for you to pitch it and find out how screwed you are, there's tension there.  Because you don't know how screwed I am - and neither do I, really; at least, not for sure.  So I'm gambling my future when I choose not to give, but I don't know all the results.<br/><br/>Second, because the damage is something other than a straight downward spiral.  It has...   other effects all tied into it, and decisions, and so on.  The "damage" is interesting in and of itself.<br/><br/>Games - whether through design or group procedures of play - that do one or both of those things with their "hit points" always stike me as having one more kind of grabbiness, in terms of keeping me hooked into a conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131297/#Comment_131297" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T13:05:48+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  1:05PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, <br/><br/>Yes, that can all be true.

Heroquest, TSOY, even my beloved Dogs in the Vineyard all have times where I'm like 'Can we just fucking end this now? I know its about important story shit, but we've been slogging through AP/Harm/Raises for 45 fucking minutes and I just want to move on.' <br/><br/>Anytime, really, that the mechanics become too responsible for having the say over the flow of the conflict, I feel you have the danger of something like that happening. <br/><br/>Of course, with time you can learn to avoid this in most of those games (learning to set giveable stakes being an important part of that, for example) -- but even with good stakes, narrative drive, and a solid system there can be times where the handling of mechanical bits grows dull.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131305/#Comment_131305" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T13:12:05+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  1:12PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Also, how did this become a thread about hit points?

I'm just saying there are times I would like to have the players on board with the goal of the fight before it begins. It really isnt their fault they see combat as a kill or be killed scenario every time. A lot of games just present it that way.<br/><br/>Heck, even with movies I'm the guy yelling at the hero for not taking out the bad guy who looks unconcious, because we KNOW he is just going to get back up and sucker punch someone.

For instance, one PC finds the hostage girl in the closet.  Twenty guys with guns walk into the room.  The PC is still in the closet with the girl.  Freedom is just outside the front door.  The guys are going to find the PC and the girl if they try to wait them out.<br/><br/>Now, the first part is the hard part.  The PC <em>is not</em> going to wade in and kill all twenty of those guys.  The hostage girl is not going to be his combat-effective sidekick to help him kill all twenty guys.  I call this the 'hard part' because lots of gamers have been conditioned to think that NPC antagonists are statted up to be killed.  We have been conditioned to think that there is no situation that the GM will throw at us that can't, in some clever way, result in our PCs standing on top of all the antagonists' bodies.  It's hard, hard, <em>hard</em> to communicate to players, "If you make this about killing, you will die."<br/><br/>The second part, though, is the easy part.  The player just needs to figure out what he actually wants to accomplish in the scene.  Does he want the girl to escape?  Does he want to escape, as well?  Does he want to distract the guys while the girl escapes?  Does he want to shame the guys into honorable, one-on-one combat with their champion?  Given a good and robust system that <em>doesn't</em> rely on hit points, you can usually pull off any and all of these. The trick is getting the first part across -- combat to the death is not a viable option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131330/#Comment_131330" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T13:59:00+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  1:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another reason I think a lot of roleplaying fights suck: they're competitive when they shouldn't necessarily be.<br/><br/>Think of the competitive fights you've watched: boxing, ultimate fighter, fencing, wrestling, fights at your local karate dojo.  All times where one person was trying to humiliate or beat the crap of another person.<br/><br/>Now think of the cooperative, staged fights that you've watched: all movie fights ever.  In movies, the fighters are cooperating to tell the story of a fight, which is way different than actually competing to win.  This actually came up in the giant shark game I ran last night.  I didn't make it clear to the players that their role in the story was to be actors in a giant shark movie, which often required them to willingly put their characters in danger or die in really interesting ways.  Instead, they like kept trying to survive and stuff, just like anyone would if they were faced with giant sharks.  It was a very "duh" moment for me as a game designer and player.<br/><br/>So, yeah, we're basically <b>really bad</b> at narrativist fights or even creating the expectation that conflict should be expressive and not about survival or winning.  Issues surrounding hit points are just the tip of that very large iceberg.<br/><br/>Here's another issue: in all of roleplaying, but especially in fights, we're really focused on delivering <b>pictures</b> when what we're got are <b>words</b>.  We're not video game designers or movie directors, and, unless you're working with miniatures, our visual tools for illustrating what's occurring are very few (even with miniatures, the visual vocabulary is still pretty limited).  I can say, "I pull off a butterfly kick that lands on the top of his head and tips him backwards into the vat of acid," but that takes WAY longer to say than it does to watch on a movie screen, which robs roleplaying fights of a lot of the pacing and clarity that I mentioned earlier.  Also, since the moves in a roleplaying fight are generally described on the spot, not prepared beforehand, it can be hard to pull that crazy ultra-awesome kick description out of your brain.  You can see it in your head, but can you describe it like a brutal poet on command?  Probably not consistently.  (Also, I hereby declare my copyright on "Brutal Poet" as the name of a future fight game).  Unless we can figure out a way to develop a verbal vocabulary of fight, one that's not an imperfect rendering of the pictures in our heads, then descriptions of fights will always be a pale imitation of the visual media we wish we were partaking in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131331/#Comment_131331" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T14:01:06+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  2:01PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thought came to me when I was reading Brand Robin's post above (re: "do you lose enough resources that going on is dangerous or not" fights), and that's that to some extent I don't believe that EVERY fight has to be interesting.<br/><br/>Or to be more specific, fights don't all have to be interesting in the same way, or serve the same purpose.  Those D&amp;D random encounters don't move the story forward and they don't typically have any meaningful stakes on the line, but they perform several important functions nonetheless.  The most important function is that they are good practice!  What you learn from whupping that gang of trolls on the road are the skills you'll be using when you get to the interesting fight in the bad guy's keep later on.  You get to work the kinks out of your teamwork, you get to test out your spells and abilities, and you learn -- pretty quickly in many cases -- what works and what doesn't work.  You can even try out weird ideas, because if they don't work it's not like you ruined the climactic moment of the game.  Really, I think the rehearsal/experimentation side of random "unimportant" challenges gets lost sometimes, and that's a shame.<br/><br/>(And if you noticed that experimentation tends to be a good way to add personal, out-of-character interest to a combat scene that doesn't have any in-game significance, I noticed that, too!  In lots of cases, people will manufacture, inject, find, or imagine their own entertainment directly into fight scenes that on paper look dull as dishwater, if they're given room to do so.)<br/><br/>"Pointless" fights can also have an appeal all their own -- there might not be anything interesting on the line at all and no challenge whatsoever when the greatest gunfighter in the world mows down the small army of jumpsuited thugs in under thirty seconds, but it still somehow manages to be fun on many different levels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131334/#Comment_131334" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T14:04:04+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  2:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 2:07PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pedyo</cite>So - does anyone here have any great advise or tricks to make fights more interesting? Preferably something that's usable for any system but references to specific system are of course cool. Oh, and I don't really want to hear "No, I haven't had this experience!" If so - cool for you! Instead - please share how you run fights!</blockquote>\nHere's what I like to do in fights, in general, regardless of RPG:<br/>* Equip the players with the ability to work in scenery &amp; terrain in a favorable way (rather than in a penalizing way) -- swinging from chandeliers &amp; using broken bottles as clubs is fun.  So is bringing said chandelier down and smashing a foe's broken bottle.  Let players be creative without penalty.<br/>* Equip the players with the ability to work with each other in a way that's better than if they worked solo and in parallel, in a way that involes all the players -- something beyond "oh, hey, flanking bonus" (Edit: as Jonathan Walton just said above, needless competition in combat is a downer.)<br/>* Equip the players with the ability to modify the situation beyond "hey, I damage you."  This ties into modifying the scenery/terrain<br/>* Create a sense of desperation in a serious fight.<br/>* Add in a physical element to play to create a more visceral experience (at its basic could be having your HP has a stack of coins on your sheet)<br/><br/>Here's what I wish I could do, but always seems to feel cheap in most systems I've played:<br/>* Tap into the chaos of battle and change up the situation on a moment's notice.<br/>* Make fear, confusion and other psychological effects on the same level as physical damage, so they could be used in concert.<br/><br/>Here's what I wish I could always do, but don't always achieve:<br/>* Make fights end on a bang rather than a whimper.<br/>* Make every roll of the dice feel like something potentially powerful.  Meaningless, rote rolls suck.<br/><br/>So, I'm working on my badass fighty game, Mythender.  While it's not hitting on all of these, this is a good list of my goals for the game.  Another goal of mine for the game is to make HP feel less like a pacing mechanic (and maybe even a reverse-currency) and more like a precious, scary thing to lose.  But that gets away from generic bits and into what I'm specifically trying to do with my game, and thus well off-topic.<br/><br/>Point of note: everytime I test out Mythender's battle system, the stakes aren't personal and there's no game beyond "hey, guys, help me test out my character creation system &amp; battle system again?"  In all but one test, everyone loves the shit out of the fight.  So, to put out something of a dissenting opinion, you don't need <em>story</em> to make your fight interesting.  Shoot, sometimes maybe that's a <em>crutch</em>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131342/#Comment_131342" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T14:11:17+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  2:11PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I can say, "I pull off a butterfly kick that lands on the top of his head and tips him backwards into the vat of acid," but that takes WAY longer to say than it does to watch on a movie screen, which robs roleplaying fights of a lot of the pacing and clarity that I mentioned earlier.</blockquote>\nI also find that with pacing and clarity you can sometimes have one without the other, or that both are on a sliding scale. <br/><br/>Like, I often focus on graphic novel description for action scenes -- where you have an image or two that stand for the whole of a fight. This can literally be an image or two, with everything between filled in by the "viewer" in the same way you do as in a novel, or by simply focusing on a couple of points in the action. (Like, "so he knocks him down and then chases him across the apartment, stomping and crushing through glass and the wooden table, while I'm grabbing shit left and right, trying to throw it at him to give me long enough to get back on my feet"  -- that could be two or three minutes on the screen, with lots of actions, but I'm just focused on the knocked down, get up again, with everything else more eluded to than described.) <br/><br/>In those situations you can have pace, but you don't always have the clarity. The more clarity you add, often, the more you slow down. <br/><br/>Personally, however, I don't always have a problem with that. I'd rather make sure everyone sees a few of the same images and results, and let them all make up their own vision of what happens between those key points (graphic novel reading style, again) than make sure everyone sees every blow and counter point by point the same. In a movie we all see the same thing (more or less), in a play less so. In a game, why worry so much about every specific?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131345/#Comment_131345" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T14:22:35+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  2:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 2:23PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I can say, "I pull off a butterfly kick that lands on the top of his head and tips him backwards into the vat of acid," but that takes WAY longer to say than it does to watch on a movie screen, which robs roleplaying fights of a lot of the pacing and clarity that I mentioned earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>This can literally be an image or two, with everything between filled in by the "viewer" in the same way you do as in a novel, or by simply focusing on a couple of points in the action.</blockquote>\nOne of the techniques I've been working to develop has a similar vibe, only I think I'm being explicit about it.

This mechanic allows any player to suggest a secondary goal for the current conflict as long as it doesn't short-circuit the already-stated goals of the conflict.<br/><br/>After that, either player can claim that goal or its opposite by sacrificing some of their advantage in the conflict.  If neither player claims the goal, the status quo is retained.  <br/><br/>It's very cool.

(I apologize for shotgunning it today -- doing a few things at once).<br/><br/>In the above situation, I'm not treating the roll as a piece of random information.  Yes, that's what it's doing, but it's not why I'm really wanting to use it.<br/><br/>Have you heard a really good public speaker or storyteller speak?  Said speaker knows how to say things well, and part of that is knowing when to use a pause.  That is the more powerful piece of making that roll -- at points in our narrative of this fight, we shut up for a moment and let that silence (or the claking of dice) fill the room.  It's the negative space in our story that makes the moments feel a bit more vibrant.<br/><br/>That's why I like breaking up the action like that.  The fortune is a bonus to me, not the reason for it.  (Specific to Mythender: the rolling isn't task resolution -- you're going to be successful.  It's more of a pacing mechanic on said success.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131365/#Comment_131365" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T15:06:33+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  3:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 3:08PM by Brand_Robins.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, <br/><br/>That's part of what I'm talking about with graphic novel framing. See, in a graphic novel/comic book the gutter between the frames is just as important as the frames themselves. What happens in one still frame becomes what happens in the next still frame, and that gutter is where the action happens, where you build your understanding of the work. (If you already know this, sorry for stating the obvious. If anyone doesn't and wants to know more, I HIGHLY recommend <i>Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art</i> by Scott McCloud. Hell, I recommend it anyway as a lot of the stuff he talks about with detail levels, projection, and avatar issues in comics ports almost 1 to 1 to RPGs.) <br/><br/>I find that when you think of it that way, putting the dice roll in the gutter makes perfect sense. And while it doesn't fit to movie pacing, it does fit to graphic novel pacing.<br/><br/>Also, and on the more general topic -- wasn't there a whole essay about how to run fights in one of the Amber RPG books?

I use to see the second not as deciding for the character, but as acting on the consequences of his previous actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131443/#Comment_131443" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T17:05:55+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  5:05PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, no, Tristan, I'm talking about telling the player that going out guns blazing would be a stupid move.

I kind of see a continuum between "outside the door, you hear movement" and "violence will get you killed," and that the axis is the GM's responsibility as arbiter of the fiction, you know?  Further down that axis would be "you're too afraid to leave the closet," which certainly starts to threaten character ownership.  But if the GM is thinking "there's no way to survive this fight," on some level that's a fact of the fiction that's as much the GM's to convey as the girl's presence in the closet.  (Granted that, systemically, the GM can make that assertion.)<br/><br/>I realize at this point that you're now helpfully standing in while I debate with myself, but am I at least making some sense?

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Here's another issue: in all of roleplaying, but especially in fights, we're really focused on delivering<b>pictures</b>when what we're got are<b>words</b>.  We're not video game designers or movie directors, and, unless you're working with miniatures, our visual tools for illustrating what's occurring are very few (even with miniatures, the visual vocabulary is still pretty limited).  I can say, "I pull off a butterfly kick that lands on the top of his head and tips him backwards into the vat of acid," but that takes WAY longer to say than it does to watch on a movie screen, which robs roleplaying fights of a lot of the pacing and clarity that I mentioned earlier.  Also, since the moves in a roleplaying fight are generally described on the spot, not prepared beforehand, it can be hard to pull that crazy ultra-awesome kick description out of your brain.  You can see it in your head, but can you describe it like a brutal poet on command?  Probably not consistently.  (Also, I hereby declare my copyright on "Brutal Poet" as the name of a future fight game).  Unless we can figure out a way to develop a verbal vocabulary of fight, one that's not an imperfect rendering of the pictures in our heads, then descriptions of fights will always be a pale imitation of the visual media we wish we were partaking in.</blockquote>\nThis is huge, and not limited just to fights. <br/><br/>The advantage of words was known to radio drama long before we were even around - and it was emotional, not physical. A desperate fight was established by buildup, not execution - what's a Western gunfight in sound except a few shots? But if you've had Black Bart gun down Shorty and Sherriff Bill and kidnap Miss Standish and sneer at all that's good and decent, a few ricochet sound effects becomes, in the mind's eye, a wild fracas.  I know, I know, all right thinking people just want to jump right in and get to 'the good stuff', but in the words of that one Cake video, "observe the rising action".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131513/#Comment_131513" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T00:00:10+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 12:00AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow - I go to sleep and when I wake up, "my" thread has exploded.

The reason the fight ended up being so good was:<br/><br/> 1.) changing terrain. The hero and villain battled across rooftops and eventually into a building, causing huge amounts of damage to everything around them. <br/><br/>2.) The fight alternated between different goals. At first the hero was just trying to get his wounded friend to safety and was being pursued, and then it became a rather bitter fight between him and the villain with both trying to kill each other. However, when he finally got the villain down and was tempted to administer the coup de grace, he realized more villains were coming, and he could either take vengence on his opponent or save his friend. It was a great moment for the player, who really struggled with it, but finally said to the villain "I guess for today I'm still a hero" and saved the friend.<br/><br/> And 3.) Both me and the player really knew the rules, and were using them against one another in a very competative but friendly manner. I remember near the end of the fight the player used an attack that caused a ton of damage and knockback, so I had the villain declare a simultaneous attack, meaning I don't try to dodge but you can't dodge my hit either. As I described the armored baddy being blasted backwards through the wall, I said "And that is when you see the cluster of micro grenades leave her hand." The look on the player's face as the building detonated was priceless.<br/><br/>The best part of that session, and all of the players talked about it afterwards, was the amount of buy-in felt by everyone in the room. It was a pivitol moment in the storyline, told us a lot about the characters themselves, and was just a lot of fun, even with some clunky game mechanics. I still have buddies who live in different parts of the country who call and talk about that session.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131596/#Comment_131596" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T08:25:02+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  8:25AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2008 8:26AM by Tristan.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is one thing about most combat systems I have seen that keeps bugging me. Initiative.<br/><br/>Usually, things work something like this:<br/><br/><b>Player 1: </b>I do this and that, and move there.<br/><b>Player 2: </b>Cool! Then I'll move after him and do this other thing.<br/><b>Player 3: </b>Wait for me! I need some help. Could you instead come here?<br/><b>Player 2: </b>Sure. I'll go with you then.<br/><br/>The point is that actions are reactive. You react to what happened to other people, or to what the opposition did before you, or in anticipation to what they will do.<br/><br/>In long term turns (such as the old AD&amp;D 1 minute rounds) it <i>almost</i> makes sense. In 6-10 seconds rounds it does not.<br/><br/>An example. Once, playing a high level campaign in D&amp;D, my brother's NPC monk was fighting our party. My character's high dexterity and a very cool combination of feats gave me a +9 modifier to my initiative. So I pictured him being a very fast man, with lightning reflexes and a high reaction rate... I rolled a total init score of 18. Cool. The monk got a 19. Mmm... Well, there are faster people out there... Then, thanks to my brother's cleaver (and power played) combination of feats and class abilities, he got to charge me, hit me twice, jump to the wall, do his Matrix stuff walking through the wall, and jump back where he started (just outside my movement limit). Then it was my turn. Second in the round to act...<br/><br/>It was a godammin 6 seconds round! It is not like we were spending time just waiting until he got his actions done! To be a little more technical, we'd have to consider that his monk, with only 1 point of difference in initiative, acted only fractions of a second before me!<br/><br/>And then I acted... I did my mumbo jumbo... Then it was the next player's turn... And so on.<br/><br/>Of course, talking about high level characters in a crunchy game is destined to eventually make combats last for hours (literally). But that is just highlighting the problem. Same thing would happen with many many less actions per round...<br/><br/>So turns are <b>reactive</b>. There is no simultaneousness, no adaptation (you act on what your opponent did, you don't get to act in a way you'll affect directly what he is trying to do at the moment), and definitely no realism. Anyone who has participated in any sort of martial art or confrontational sport will know what I mean.<br/><br/>Sure, some SG try to address the problem, but so far I haven't been satisfied by the way any handles it.<br/><br/>And some people could argue you could try to stay in character and handle things in the most realistic way possible, without reacting to things that just happened half a second before you did... Or that you could try to keep in mind the time frame where things are actually happening. The thing is that the systems themselves do not work on the problem; they work <i>around</i> it.<br/><br/>I have been trying to devise a system more to my liking. Still working on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131702/#Comment_131702" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T12:30:41+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 12:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been working on a new version of Console, in which fights can easily degenerate into the most boring sort in the world (and yet rarely do for some reason). Here are some tricks I've used to make things more interesting.<br/><br/>* Go halfway between the usual front/back row setup and a free-movement battle map. Battlefields include only the interesting locations.<br/>* Give each battlefield location some sort of effect. Nothing too complex, but a reason to want to be there or want to leave.<br/>* Give monsters and characters ways to push each other around the battlefield so people don't always hang out in the best locations.<br/>* Give every character 2-3 useful things to do, but not many more. They need choices beyond "I hit the damaged one," but too many choices wreck the flow of the game. Some character types will have a lot of options, but those are for people who enjoy playing the Swiss Army Daiklaive.<br/>* Make characters go down in 2-4 hits, so every hit is meaningful. Give them plenty of healing that they have to use often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131760/#Comment_131760" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T15:35:01+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  3:35PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two comments:<br/><br/>1) For cool initiative system, see Sorcerer. Players declare what the character intends to to, they roll, the roll determines initiative and level of execution, if they have to defend before they act, they have a choice of aborting the intended action for a good defense or sucking it up and hoping to survive to execute their action. <br/><br/>2) this thread drifted away from the consideration of "making the fight meaningful" which I think is actually more important to a memorable rpg fight than terrain and maneuvers, but also harder to pin down unless the game has a mechanic for it, like Riddle of Steel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131919/#Comment_131919" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-01T16:34:09+00:00" title="March  1, 2008  4:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I had a thought, in part inspired by an earlier comment (sorry I am not showing the actual quote) concerning duplicating the kinds of fight scenes we see in movies and television and why that is so difficult to do in an RPG or story game. I realized those kinds of media we most often refer to in looking at RPGs are visual, ie movies and television, while what we should be looking at is narrative combats, like books and stories. It is impossible to duplicate the kinds of combat seen in movies and television because they have the ability to slow down or speed up combat, show you details or give you an overview, it is just a really different way of presenting things.<br/><br/>I love R.A. Salvatore in part because of the way he does fight scenes in his books. I always thought he gives really good levels of detail in his works, describing individual moves and reactions but still keeping the pace of the battle really exciting. But I've also noticed there are ways he glosses over some of the more complicated manuevers, allowing the reader's mind to fill in the gaps, which really is a good way to do it in roleplaying games. We are often looking at the attempt (die roll) and then the outcome (results of the die roll, damage and effect). I remember one passage in one of the Dark Elf books where the hero Drizzt comes up behind a wererat in the sewers and it said something along the lines of the wererat being hit 10 times before realizing the first blow (im paraphrasing of course). And I remember thinking "How cool is that! That's what I want to do in my game." But Salvatore presented that moment of awesomeness in one line, not 10 to-hit die rolls and 10 damage rolls. <br/><br/>Also, I loved the way Robert Jordan presented skilled swordfighting in The Wheel of Time books. I think around the third book the main character Rand, who is still learning to be a swordsman and carries a blade that falsely presents him as a master swordsman, goes up against a true master swordsman. The combat was a paragraph of named fighting maneuvers with no real description of their actions or the fight, but it absolutely rocked and captured my imagination. Jordan never tells you what Leaf Falling on Water looks like, but everyone who read the book had an image in their head of what that fight looked like, and the individuals really filled in the awesomeness of that scene.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131921/#Comment_131921" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-01T17:09:21+00:00" title="March  1, 2008  5:09PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Pedyo,<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n How, for instance, a fight in Usagu Yojimbo can be over in just three frames?

Yes, I could easily be much better at making fights MEAN something, but even meaningful fights need something to make the blow-by-blow account (or however it's narrated) interesting. What do you say the fourth time your Strike hits (or misses) in a BW-fight? I need a better vocabulary for this. And this is where the Usagi Yojimbo example becomes meaningful. The visual language of the fights is very well developed and varied. I'd even say that you could read a four-frame fight from Usagi Yojimbo without knowing anything about the story, totally out of context - and still enjoy it immensely.<br/><br/>/Peter                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132232/#Comment_132232" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T02:05:35+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  2:05AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Hituro,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you missread the first paragraph that was quoted.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith UY, why do you know he'll get through?

You also know that, 99 times out of 100, the innocent child will not die. Of course there are occasional exceptions, which exist to shock and surprise you, and of course those surprises are less interesting the second time, but I don't think that has anything to do with the fights.<br/><br/>As Pedyo says UY fights are beautiful, expressive, and comprehensible on their own. I think it is true that while the context gives meaning you could enjoy a UY fight strip entirely out of context as well. They have a beauty all of their own, which is what I think we are trying to capture.<br/><br/>(Sadly I can't find any fight sequences online to include, but there are plenty of covers online that give you a nice feel for the dynamics of the moment to moment combat, e.g.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.usagiyojimbo.com/other/images/uycovers/uy3cov105.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132247/#Comment_132247" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T05:12:51+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  5:12AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pedyo</cite>What do you say the fourth time your Strike hits (or misses) in a BW-fight?</blockquote>Oh man, there's nothing worse than a fight that is a series of misses (or its equally-annoying cousin, hits-for-negligible-damage).  I hate combat systems that encourage that kind of thing, and whenever we use one of them anyway, I tend to make noncombat characters just so I don't even feel tempted to go into a fight.<br/><br/>Still, there are a few things that can be done.  One thing that's always appealed to me is changing what a miss actually means -- instead of telling the player "you miss," go with "your opponent parries the blow!" or "you realize at the last moment that he's luring you into a trap, and pull back!" or something else that changes the blow-by-blow account from being about how incompetent the character is into a tale about two skilled fighters squaring off against each other.  It helps reduce the sting a bit.<br/><br/>The other trick I like is rushing the rolls when they're going bad.  Don't even bother saying "you miss," just call for another roll, and another, and another, until finally he connects, so that you at least establish the <i>rhythm</i> of the clashing swords or flying bullets, even if the dice aren't being cooperative.  (It also helps if the player can feel the beat and abbreviate his descriptions accordingly.)<br/><br/>If you can steer the fight away from just trading blow for blow, that can also help break the tedium of endless near-misses.  Breaking off the fight and moving somewhere else, introducing a new complication, trying a strange tactic (tripping, grappling, disarming), something that lets you introduce a "moment of choice" as described earlier in the thread, so that the pattern can be broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133026/#Comment_133026" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T15:04:29+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  3:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi again, Hituro,<br/><br/>In terms of making fights interesting and what you account, I think:<br/>A: The author is adhering to an creative limitation that he doesn't nessersarily have to. Also, you as audience are sticking to the creative limit, even though you don't nessersarily have to (you could just want the kid to die, for example). I think there's also a strong social aspect here of sharing the same values.<br/><br/>B: The excitement comes from the author wanting to adhere to the limitation, <i>yet not knowing how to yet</i>. The art he makes is an attempt to adhere to that limit - eg, he has to depict some way of the child being saved. But how?? That's the excitement moment, where a rule must be adhered to, but it's uncertain how to do it. As a reader, with each panel of art, your finding out how he stuck to that rule.<br/><br/>That's how I'd put it, because when you write it out that way it begins to become clear how to port it over into roleplay. So I hope its of some help in that way and I can write more if it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5860/how-to-make-fights-interesting" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5860/how-to-make-fights-interesting" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5860/how-to-make-fights-interesting/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5860%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5860%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
