I have the Classic Marvel Game (FASRIP) which I love, and I have M&amp;M which I also love dearly.  I am considering picking this game up, but am not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you make your own characters?  Or do you have to play their characters?<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378500/#Comment_378500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T13:22:27+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  1:22PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: malachijohn</cite>Can you make your own characters?</blockquote>\nYou sure can. In fact, it has the same character creation options from the original FASRIP game.<br/><br/>You can play a premade character, you can randomly generate a character, or you can create a character from a concept based on their guidelines and instructions. There is NOT a system for mechanically constraining character creation (well, aside from the random generator) like a point buy system or even something like "pick X powers from a list". It's very open ended, which some people dislike, but it sort of has to be that way because they want to handle a very WIDE range of character concepts. You should be able to stat out any Marvel character with the system in the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/malachijohn" title="malachijohn"><img alt="malachijohn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/malachijohn">malachijohn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378503/#Comment_378503" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T13:32:37+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  1:32PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, that is good to hear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think of the game as a whole?

It plays fast and loose with objective, fixed benchmarks (i.e. it doesn't really care how many tons Spider-Man or Luke Cage can lift, they're both Superhuman Strength d10) but incorporates a lot of things other supers games typically don't (like how well you work within a team vs. solo, or background/personality/catchphrases, etc).<br/><br/>In general, I wanted to make it possible for heroes of varying "power levels" to be enjoyable in a single team environment without having to kludge one of them with loads of disadvantages or cheat with points. Points don't matter. Balance is achieved through play and with the game currency that loops around through player-authored limits and spent to do cool things.<br/><br/>Or you could go to www.margaretweis.com and check out our forums.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Cam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378510/#Comment_378510" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T13:56:07+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  1:56PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2012 1:58PM by stupidgremlin.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: malachijohn</cite>OK, that is good to hear.<br/><br/>What do you think of the game as a whole?

Any thoughts on this?</blockquote>\nConceptually, I think of it as Marvel Heroic is like co-writing an issue of a comic book or a movie screenplay. You aren't concerned so much with how much exactly someone can lift, or exactly how far they can teleport, but instead how effective their abilities are in getting things done. To that end, instead of having a bunch of little numerical details to represent every aspect of individual powers (range, damage, area of effect, duration, casting time, etc.), you have some broader abilities with a few dice to represent their relative potency, and SFX and Limits to further define what can and cannot be done with them. Add to this the things that motivate the character and distinctive aspects of their personality.<br/>When your character does something, you're not going to be concerned with every step that leads up to the attempt. If you want your character to rip a telephone pole out of the ground to hit a bad guy, you don't need to perform separate actions for moving over to the telephone pole, ripping it out of the ground, and then hitting the bad guy. It's all just one action (of course, assuming you have a power that makes it plausible that you could rip out that aforementioned telephone pole).<br/><br/>Task resolution itself is a matter of figuring out what aspects of your character apply to a situation, taking the associated dice, and rolling them. Take two of those dice, and total them up, which is compared either to an opponent's roll or the Doom Pool. Take one of the other dice, and that becomes the Effect (essentially how much your action impacts the rest of the fiction, which is measured in die-size as opposed to the die result).<br/><br/>But yeah, as J. Walton said, there are numerous discussions on Marvel Heroic already. This is just a recap.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: FigureFour</cite><cite>Posted By: malachijohn</cite>Can you make your own characters?</blockquote>\nYou sure can. In fact, it has the same character creation options from the original FASRIP game.<br/><br/><br/>...that is to say, it is available from their website as a PDF download. The main book deals with either pre-made characters, or free-form original characters.<br/><br/>Bottom line, at least for me, is if you like a whole bunch of granularity in your supers game, Marvel Heroic probably won't be your fave, though you might like it for a one-shot or a short campaign, just as a change of pace. If you feel bogged down by higher-crunch supers games (which is how I usually feel), then Marvel Heroic might be right up your alley.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/malachijohn" title="malachijohn"><img alt="malachijohn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/malachijohn">malachijohn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378612/#Comment_378612" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T06:00:09+00:00" title="May 16, 2012  6:00AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2012 6:01AM by malachijohn.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Guys!

A "real-time" medium is obviously better, though.  Not so much because of the back-and-forth interaction of the mechanics (though there's some of that) but more because the game takes some getting used to so there will be misunderstandings and mistakes.  Going back to do a move "right" in a PBP can totally kill the momentum.<br/><br/>Also, you need a way share the status of the Doom Pool and various die-rated effects that are in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378698/#Comment_378698" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T17:56:27+00:00" title="May 16, 2012  5:56PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2012 5:56PM by thadrine.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://onlinedungeonmaster.com/2012/03/05/marvel-heroic-rpg-maptool-framework-second-draft/" rel="nofollow">http://onlinedungeonmaster.com/2012/03/05/marvel-heroic-rpg-maptool-framework-second-draft/</a><br/>Here you go. <br/><br/>I have been running an online game using MapTools for the last two months and this system framework is great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/OnlineDM" title="OnlineDM"><img alt="OnlineDM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/OnlineDM">OnlineDM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379302/#Comment_379302" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T14:03:15+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  2:03PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thadrine - Thanks for posting about my MapTool framework here!
