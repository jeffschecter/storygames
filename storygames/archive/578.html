                    So, JBR brought up the idea of intertextuality in another thread (stories which explicitly respond to other stories).  For example, <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</i> relates to <i>Hamlet</i>, and <i>The House of Mirth</i> draws from Jane Austen's observations of the social realm.<br/><br/>I'd be curious to hear how and whether people here relate their games to existing stories.  Hence, here are some questions for thinking and discussion!<br/><br/>Do you ever set out to play or design a game with the intention of retelling, modernizing or exploring a familiar story?  What stories inspire you the most?  How does your game continue to relate to the original material?  What happens when your game, as games do, takes a left turn?<br/><br/>Do you ever set out to play or design a game that conflicts with, opposes, or brings into question a familiar story?  Which stories?  How do you incorporate the original material?  How do you decide which parts to oppose, and what does it mean to you?<br/><br/>Do you make clear to your players what stories you're drawing from?  How much do you actually use the original material, and how much is it 'inspired by'?  Are there certain kinds of stories that work better with certain games?  Are there certain kinds of stories that work better in general?<br/><br/>Do you find yourself turning to books, movies, television shows?  All of the above?  Do you find yourself looking to recent works or to older material?  Do you go out and investigate stories just so that you can work them into your game?  Do you often rely on what you know about a particular story from hearsay or cultural familiarity?  Do you plan to use other works in this way, or do you wake up one morning and realize your game is <i>Hamlet</i> (so to speak)?<br/><br/>I'm sure there are more questions that one could ask, but this should get things started nicely.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                </div>

                            Just as a quick note, with a more developed answer to follow, lots of gamers do this without even thinking about it.  If you're playing <em>Star Wars</em> or <em>Middle Earth</em>, your game is already interacting with other stories from film and prose.                        </div>

                            I don't know if I'd say that's "without thinking of it"...I mean...surely they chose to play Star Wars or Lord of the Rings based at least partly on their love of the existing stories and a desire to participate in the stories' setting?                        </div>

                            Right, Tony - I don't disagree with that.  What I'm trying to get it is how and whether it happens <i>intentionally</i> or <i>consciously</i>, or how it becomes apparent to you in retrospect.  When do you become aware that you're thinking of Joseph or Odysseus?  How does your awareness of the stories that you're playing with (or against!) change you as a designer, a GM or a player?<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            I do this all the damn time, but as a former literature student, it's actually pretty hard for me not to.  My default frame of reference when telling stories is that they are embedded in a context of other stories, and this is at the same time a potent tool and an occasional stumbling block.<br/><br/>I favor games that explicitly allow or even encourage this kind of play.  I've played lots and lots (and lots) of <em>Changeling</em>, for instance, which basically has you take a myth/legend/fairytale and live it out in the modern world.  In <em>Tribe 8</em>, the local goddesses are all based off of female figures of myth and history (Joan of Arc, the Black Dahlia, Baba Yaga), and coming from their tribe constitutes making your interpretation of the impact that those female figures had.<br/><br/>With my usual players over my gaming history, running out and doing in-depth research for characters and plot lines is de rigeur; I've played with lots of academics who don't bat an eye at plumbing the yellowed stacks of the library to satisfy a minor point of curiosity.  For a lot of us, it's also a way to recontextualize the things that are near and dear to us.  So we bring our backgrounds in, say, Indian history and myth to bear on our game play (*cough*cough*Brand*cough*).<br/><br/>So that's all the nice bits.  On the other hand, this can crimp your style if you're not too careful.  There's a difference between recontextualizing and simply re-enacting.  To take a terrible example, I once played in a game that was based off of the anime title Ninja Scroll -- but the GM didn't tell us that, and the GM was the only one who had seen the movie.  We faced a succession of badguys ripped directly from the movie, and no matter what we did or how we tried to overcome them, the only way to win was to do what the hero had done in the movie -- which wasn't always an obvious option (dude, you totally have to dunk the guy with a beehive on his back into the river, and then the bees will sting him as they drown -- <em>duh!</em>).<br/><br/>Now in my older-and-wiser days, I recognize that it's all good to crib <em>situation</em> from other sources and letting the characters create their own addresses to that situation, but expecting play to mirror the plotline is probably just silly.                        </div>

                            So, for everything everone else has said: yes. <br/><br/>I also like to do this very deliberatly. "It's like Buffy, but in South Central in 69" or "So what if we do something like Star Wars, but assume that the Jedi are a scary cult rather than the heroes?" <br/><br/>And themeatics aside, anyone who plays with me would probably be vastly disapointed in my "creativity" if they had read all the same books I read. The number of NPCs, locations, ideas, and conflicts that are just reimagings and serial-numberless hacks of the shit I gank full out of books and movies is overwhelming. <br/><br/>Not to mention that I carry my Comedia Del Arte types around with me in a bag whenever I go to game. Using typal characters that are reimaged and brought to life in response to the specific situation at hand is a tool that I cannot be without.                        </div>

                            I'm finding myself powerfully drawn to very specific sources lately - 19th century survival-at-sea narratives, Elizabethan comedy (OK, Restoration comedy, too), the 1944 Warsaw Uprising.  <br/><br/>In the latter case (Grey Ranks) I guess I'm taking the traditional war story and up-ending it by making the game about teen love and romance rather than the rate of fire of an MG-42.  At the same time I'm finding that in order to honor the subject matter, it's taking on a very documentary tone, so that your fictional drama is overlaid with real names, real places, real and horrible events.  I'm not sure it will work, but so far I'm really enjoying poking it with a stick to see what happens.                        </div>

<p>I try, with great deliberation, not to let this stuff bubble up to the conscious level.  It's a fuckin' hassle when it does.

                            I've been thinking about reusing things from other sources recently, and want to relate an experience of my own, from the other side of things.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, when I first started playing with some people who have become good friends, the GM would reuse things from various TV shows.  This made me unhappy, because he'd seen the TV show, his partner had seen the TV show, and I hadn't.  He'd introduce something to the game, and while I'm still asking questions and working out what the hell was going on, the other player is up and doing, because she recognised the situation, had previously thought about it, and knew what she wanted to do.  And she'd often recognise the situation while there were still major details unmentioned in the game.  So she'd set off to diffuse the diplomatic crises by talking to the ambassador's lover who holds the secret to the misunderstanding, while I'm still asking "Ambassador Who?  From where?" and have never heard of the lover.  I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get to do stuff that mattered, because I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what was going on.  It sucked.<br/>
<br/>
And after a little while I came to be able to tell what was going on.  The GM would also do things like introduce an NPC who was taken from, and named after, a character that he and his partner knew, and I'd treat them like an original NPC, while the other player was somehow amazingly good at guessing what was important about this brand new, shiny NPC weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never met before.<br/>
<br/>
So I asked the GM not to introduce any elements into the game taken from books, films or TV shows that I hadn't seen, unless the other player was equally unfamiliar with them.  He found this a bit annoying on my part, as it required him to both use more creativity, and stop the enjoyable fun of playing with elements of other people's fiction that he really liked.  Anyway, he agreed and things went better.  The game became really fun, though IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d occasionally wonder why the other two would decide my character was ditzy, when she hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done anything ditzy and stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
Later on the game died because we discovered that we'd been wanting different things all along.  A few weeks ago I had my wisdom teeth out, and beforehand I borrowed a bunch of DVDs off my friends to watch while I was recovering.  I watched some of the early seasons of Angel that I'd never seen.  And I discover a plot point I recognise from the game, that had happened after the GM had agreed not to use fiction I was unaware of.  And then another, and another.  It was actually kind of creepy at some points, because I can remember my character exclaiming things in response to these plots that were almost identical to things Cordelia said in the shows.  And at the time, my friends had laughed at my wit so much, and I'd thought I was so clever.<br/>
<br/>
I'm rambling.  Anyway, my take home points are:<br/>
1) Don't borrow from other fictions in ways that consistently advantage some players over others when it comes to ability to contribute.<br/>
2) Know how your fellow players feel about borrowing.<br/>

<code>TonyLB<br/><br/>I try, with great deliberation, not to let this stuff bubble up to the conscious level. It's a fuckin' hassle when it does. Suddenly I have to dedicate precious mental CPU cycles to the question of "Gosh, how does this relate to Hamlet?" </code><br/><br/>I totally get this.  I was halfway through running a great game when I realised I was actually running Le Guin's "The Farthest Shore"  (possibly my favourite fantasy novel ever).  Well not the story obviously, but the themes and the feel were right out of the book.<br/><br/>And of course as soon as I realised this, I just felt like a dick all the time, and it really threw me.  I think part of what made me feel wierd about it was the fact that it had been unconscious.  <br/><br/>I'm currently running a modern day surrealist conspiracy game set in Las Vegas and it's very consciously a mix of four different media sources:<br/><br/><i>Illuminatus!</i> Trilogy (novels)<br/><i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> (novel)<br/><i>Twin Peaks</i> (TV series)<br/><i>Bossanova</i> by Pixies (rock album)<br/><br/>I have told the players that the game is based on these sources and they are all to some extent familiar with them.  It's working quite well, but I'm using the sources as inspiration for types of NPC / Situation / Atmosphere rather than some kind of plot template.<br/><br/>It gives me a kind of handy shordhand for creating situation: any time I need to have something I just think "Hmm what would Wilson / Thompson / Lynch / Black Francis do?"<br/><br/>Failing that I just add in a surreal element and let the players interpret it into a cool situation / story.<br/><br/>What this means is that so far I haven't had any weird moments where I go "OMG I am teh plagiarist..." like I did with the above mentioned game, because I'm already aware that I'm ripping off my sources.  But also I feel ok about it, because doing it consciously means I am in control of how far I rip them off.  <br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>Also, Claire: that sounds shit.  I'd hate to be in a game like that!<br/><br/>Drew                        </div>

                            Hrm. Cool topic!<br/><br/>You know, like the other humanities survivors, I have a head pretty clouded with books, plays and so on. I draw from that big convoluted mass a lot when I'm playing, though often enough I won't remember where I'm pulling the ideas from. <br/><br/>I'm working on a game right now that's very heavily inspired by a computer game, of all things, and it turns out that the computer game was very much inspired by a TV show.<br/><br/>And I'll second the "eww" about what Claire posted. That'd make me want to seriously be absent from that game.                        </div>

                            Drew, perhaps it's also different since now you're borrowing from four sources rather than just one, so it's less emulation and more inspiration?                        </div>
