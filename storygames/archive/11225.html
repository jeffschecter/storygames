There's gotta be a name for it somewhere; it seems highly unlikely to me that I've come up with a new branch when there's all those fantasy authors out there churning out trilogy after trilogy.<br/><br/>(<b>edited to add sources where I took examples from fiction</b>)<br/><br/>It's the kind of fantasy where Barabbas is centuries old, kept alive purely by guilt;<br/>where the Black Circle is Corwin of Amber's sin against something he loved, and that's <i>the whole explanation</i> (not some big complicated thing about a Black Road through all shadows and whatnot) [<i>The Guns of Avalon</i> from Zelazny's Amber series];<br/>where Victor Frankenstein resurrects his slain wife at his monster's bidding, and she, enraged and grieved over what has befallen her, sets fire to the house and runs screaming down the hall, the rooms <i>exploding</i> as she passes, <i>because of</i> her rage and grief [<i>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</i> (film)];<br/>where Walter O'Dim plants a demon in a preacher woman's womb, and Roland of Gilead exorcises it with his gun in a manner that doesn't bear explicit description [<i>The Gunslinger</i> by Stephen King];<br/>where Roland of Gilead's guns deal more injury and damage than other guns of the same load and caliber, because of the tradition and heredity they represent -- <i>not</i> because the barrels are made out of steel from Excalibur [most of Stephen King's Dark Tower series].<br/><br/>I can try to think of more examples. But, in the mean time, does anyone know what we're looking at here? It's not high fantasy, sword &amp; sorcery, or super heroes, and those are the only fantasy genres I'm knowledgeable about.

I see some whiffs of myth and fairytales as well, but romantic fantasy seems much closer.  Then again, people may think you're talking about romance novels set in fantasy worlds, so that may not work for your ability to explain it to other people.<br/><br/>It can also pop up in sci-fi: see the<i> Coldfire</i> trilogy (starting with<i> Black Sun Rising</i>), where people's beliefs, emotions and dreams shape the real world on a strange planet colonized by humans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249371/#Comment_249371" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-02T10:43:08+00:00" title="January  2, 2010 10:43AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds to me like Gothic Fantasy, or even Gothic Horror. Or just plain Gothic. To quality that, I'll explain that the definition of Gothic Horror which I prefer is this: when the emotions and interactions of the main characters are more important to the plot than scaring the crap out of people and defeating evil. So here we see a fantasy game where what people think and believe is more important than what they are and what they do. <br/><br/>In other words, it's not about who killed who, it's about why. Would you say that's accurate?<br/><br/>Romanticism would certainly be another way of putting it, as Krippler said, but I tend to veer away from the use of the word 'Romantic' because it can give the often-false impression that it's all about lovey-dovey stuff.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249372/#Comment_249372" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-02T10:54:37+00:00" title="January  2, 2010 10:54AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2010 11:27AM by Burr.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's like the Fisher King trope generalized and made into a cosmological constant.<br/><br/>So maybe...F*King Horror Fantasy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249375/#Comment_249375" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-02T11:41:23+00:00" title="January  2, 2010 11:41AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>...or is it magic realism?</blockquote>Yeah; read one hundred years of solitude for this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249379/#Comment_249379" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-02T12:41:07+00:00" title="January  2, 2010 12:41PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To elaborate: what you're describing sounds like you want fantasy where the material causality of the real world is replaced at least in some instances with an <i>emotional causality</i> where things happen because of how characters <i>feel</i>.

In light of this, Allegorical Fantasy would be my definition; for while the Gothic contains the allegorical, not all instances of allegory are Gothic. <br/><br/>Let me just break down the most Gothic example to demonstrate the difference: <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Victor Frankenstein resurrects his slain wife at his monster's bidding, and she, enraged and grieved over what has befallen her, sets fire to the house and runs screaming down the hall, the rooms exploding as she passes</span>, <b>because of her rage and grief</b><br/><br/>The underlined is Gothic. The bold is Allegorical Fantasy. If you were just writing <i>'Frankenstein 2: Bride of Frankenstein'</i> then the former section would be fine, the fact you now have added a causal magical/surreal allegorical element (fire and explosions literally <i>because</i> of rage and grief, not implying them coincidentally) moves the example away from the Gothic. <br/><br/>Sorry If I sound preachy; there's an English teacher in me just waiting to burst out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249426/#Comment_249426" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-03T09:30:28+00:00" title="January  3, 2010  9:30AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2010 9:30AM by Rafu.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know what its name is, but it sure is a kind of fantasy I like to play. ^^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton" title="LaughingJackWilton"><img alt="LaughingJackWilton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton">LaughingJackWilton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249428/#Comment_249428" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-03T10:10:24+00:00" title="January  3, 2010 10:10AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The literature described falls into the genre of Gothic romance.

The particular literary descendants of the style are probably to be found more in Gothic literature than in oh-my-no-this-isn't-fantasy-because-its-very-serious Magical Realism, just because Gothic takes itself seriously in a way that most magical realist lit doesn't - the magician is showing his tricks to the audience with a wink and a nod, look how clever we the author-and-reader conspiracy are because we know that this isn't really an angel or a magic tree, it's a Metaphor. Meanwhile the Gothic is insisting that even though this scary gentleman with the sharp teeth is quite clearly a big honking Metaphor, it's really, really a scary monster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249561/#Comment_249561" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-04T12:05:29+00:00" title="January  4, 2010 12:05PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2010 12:06PM by Marshall Burns.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's magical realism -- aren't the magical events in MR something rare and unique?

It's a tad longer than a "One Sheet" but it gives all the details I feed to players when we start a game.<br/><br/>Humanity<br/><br/>This setting is all about Love.  Not only romantic love but love for family, love for country, faith, even life itself.  A character gains Humanity when he takes actions that strengthens the bonds with the things he loves in his life or bonds of love between others.  A meaningful gift to a lover, an observance of a family tradition, the blessing of a child into your faith, all bring Humanity gain.  But love can corrupt. <br/><br/>A character loses Humanity when he takes actions that damage the bonds of love between himself or others.  Coveting a lover who does not love you in return, using family tradition as a weapon of control and dogmatically following faithful tenants without practical effect, all lead to Humanity loss. <br/><br/>At zero Humanity a character is no longer capable of real love.  That might mean complete isolation or a total conversion of functional love into an all consuming obsession.<br/><br/>The Setting<br/><br/>The setting is mostly dense forest as far as the eye can see veined with many streams and rivers.  There is the odd mountain here and there and a swamp or two.  To the west the forest ends at a bleak coast of turbulent seas and rocky islands not far off the shore.  The night is longer than the day and the winters and falls longer than the summer and springs but the daylight is warmer and the smells of spring sweeter than we would understand them.<br/><br/>Culturally there are very few cities located far, far apart with no concept of a central government.  The highest ranking noble you are likely to find is a Baron or Marquis who controls the immediate lands.  The rare cities are dense and decadent as well as more "modern" with a late 18th Century feel.  As you go further out things become more primitive and more medieval in flavor.  Travel is dangerous as the woods are peppered with bandits.<br/><br/>Religiously almost everyone is in the cities is a member of The Church (or at least pretends to be).  The Church has Abbies dotting the forest lands everywhere spreading its faith.  However, many in the wilderness areas still believe in the older woodland gods and beings.<br/><br/>Sorcerers<br/><br/>Sorcerers are people with a stake in the health of the world around them.  They have and value whatever binds them to those around them.  That might be the company of a lover, ties to a strong family, a respect for the wilderness, their personal faith or any other worldly tie.  Where they stand morally relative to these ties is wide open from paragon of virtue to the utterly corrupt.  But these ties exist and drive them.<br/><br/>Stamina<br/>\tOutlaw born - You grew up among outsiders such as bandits or gypsies and your physical senses and presence are honed to their sensibilities.<br/>\tTrained soldier - Good with all weapons, used to the travails and conduct of war and soldiery.  Note that unarmed combat skills are very basic, limited to punching and rough-and-tumble grappling.<br/>\tBig and vigorous - Speaks for itself: you're a big person.<br/>\tJust healthy - This is for characters who are not physically special in any way.<br/>\tArcane Regimen - This is what classical sorcerers do to stay in shape: funny breathing, stretching, calisthenics, controlled diet, and so on.<br/>\tUnnatural means - Bathe in virgin lamb blood, run around naked in the moonlight, recite poetry in the shadow of the Frog God... this sort of thing seems to work for some people.<br/><br/>Will<br/>\tBrush with the Unknown - In the course of an otherwise normal life, the character has encountered true, all-encompassing insight.  Ever since, nothing has really been satisfying.  You must define the experience and the character's reaction to it ever since.<br/>\tAristocrat - This is not a social status as much as a state of mind.  The character is "the cat who walks by himself," and all places are alike to him.<br/>\tZest for life - Wahoo! If it's fun or feels good, you go for it.  If it doesn't, it's in your way.<br/>\tAngry - The character is pissed off and thoroughly ready to express this state of mind to all and sundry.<br/>\tVow - The classic motivator.  Vengeance, regaining property or status, whatever - you want it and you're going to get it.<br/>\tLover - The character derives great inner strength from the love of another, whether a specific person or anyone who's interested today.<br/>\tChurch faith - You are believer in the teaching of The Church.<br/><br/>Lore<br/>\tChangeling - You were raised by demons and know their ways well.  Now you live in the "normal" world; perhaps you are a bit unsure of yourself there.<br/>\tHalf-breed - One of your parents is a demon or undead.  You are by no means a normal human being.<br/>\tPagan - You know where the really wild things are.<br/>\tBloodline (Apprentice/Adept) - Sorcerous knowledge passes through a line of direct decedents in your family.  The seventh son of a seventh son or the first daughter of a first daughter.<br/>\tHeritage - Similar to blood line, but less linear.  Various members of your family practice sorcery.<br/>\tSecret Order - You are a member of some back-room cabal.<br/>\tChurch heresy - You know what's in all those books they keep locked in the secret rooms of the monasteries.<br/>\tNaive - These characters don't consider themselves sorcerers, but the demons do.<br/><br/>Demons<br/><br/>Demons are a sorcerers passions given physical form.  The perfect lover in the form a succubus.  A family heirloom such as a bloodstone necklace or watchful portrait of the patriarch.  The ever present spirit of the forest or river.  A biblical plague to wash away the sins of man.  The eye of the lich-king to carry his sight always.  The soul of your dead teacher housed in the body of another.<br/><br/>Demon Desires<br/>Love <br/>Corruption <br/>Power \t\t\t<br/>Sensual Gratification<br/>To Worship\t\t<br/>To Be Worshiped<br/>Creation/Artistry\t<br/>Knowledge<br/>Ruin\t\t\t<br/><br/>Rituals.<br/><br/>Rituals which summon and bind demons are based on acts of passion, devotion and obsession.  Imagine a man bathing his sword in his dead brother's blood as he calls a demon into the sword to guide his hand to his brother's killer.  Rituals which punish and banish demons are based on compassion, empathy and love.  Imagine a man renewing the wedding vows of a husband and wife to destroy the cursed gargoyle that has brought ruin and death to the family for generations.  These continue to be examples to get the flavor of the setting across.<br/><br/>A Sample Character.<br/><br/>Sorcerer: Myra Van Holten<br/><br/>Appearance: Round face framed by shoulder length black hair with wide green eyes, petite nose and mouth.

I really like seeing things like that, because it's fun and super-helpful (from a design standpoint) to look at it and say, "Yes! I agree totally!" and "...Nah, I don't think so," and occasionally "The fuck?" (there weren't any of those this time). Because now I get to think about those reactions, and work the reasons out in my head. So thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
