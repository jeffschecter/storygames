That's why I'd like some advice, as there are more than one way to see the same problem and we're probably not seeing it right anyway. I'm even hoping to find an opportunity in this problem.<br/><br/>Now, I'd better explain things from the start. A few years ago I found this spanish RPG called Anima Beyond Fantasy, which got a setting and classes oriented for playing a sort of Final Fantasy-like game. I'm not exactly too much into FF but I liked the ideas and the general vibe of the game. The problem was that it was based on Rolemaster, and thus featured rules and math too cumbersome for me to GM (on top that, if making PCs took a couple of hours for more or less experienced players, imagine generating stats for a staff of NPCs and monsters, since the core book didn't offered too much and at that time, and there was no sign of the supplements yet)<br/><br/>So I hacked, and hacked and hacked. And we played several campaigns and had lots of fun, but with my last two campaigns and iterations of the hack, it grew old and I felt that the players weren't having as much fun as before, so I ended the campaign quickly and let it rest in peace.<br/><br/>But then, three months ago, my friend J, who is a freak for details with a bit of OCD for game rules, tried to understand and create a character with the original Anima system. He end up so frustrated that he asked me to try and hack the game again. I realized he didn't mean that he wanted to revive the campaign, but just make a hack functional for what he wanted. Yet my old flame started to burn again and we went over the system and mechanics, taking the whole engine apart and rebuilding stuff from zero.<br/><br/>It went nice for a while until I had enough material to playtest and after a few tests it hit me that we two and the third playtester had completely different ideas in mind, which now I'm trying to take in account to see if I can make a game that satisfies the three of us. Let me go over what each of us want (or at least what I think they want, I may be mistaken so perhaps I'd have to ask them further)<br/><br/>-I can't stand arithmetics. My mind has to go into a different place to think of abstract numbers, so that really breakes my immersion (as in my concentration on what's going on in the fiction) I prefer single dice systems without too many rules and mechanics to solve different situations, and I absolutely hate to hunt hidden bonuses in obscure rules through long rulebooks. I have the worst memory for details, can't easily memorize formulas (nor dates, I keep forgetting things like birthdays and barely passed history at school) But I'm really good at using my intuition with statistics, and can improvise plot twists and consequences with no problem. That's why my own designs tend to be minimalistic (for a trad RPG) and make use of general rules instead of specific ones. I low how this speeds up battles in a way that makes them incredibly epic. About Anima, I'd like mainly to keep the over the top anime-like gameplay.<br/><br/>-J has a good memory for details, so for him powergaming and hunting for hidden bonuses isn't a problem. Neither is simple arithmetics. His frustration came from the fact that he wanted to make a rogue/sniper bowsman in anima and couldn't made a functional one without adding supernatural things. I've got the feeling that now I've gotta make our hack being able to balance anime-like characters with a 5e D&amp;D rogue, which is basically what he wants to play.<br/><br/>-T, the third playtester, is almost on the opposite spectrum of me, he loves math, even wanted to play with the original Anima system (strange, but I think I'd play the game using the original system, but I wouldn't GM it for all the gold in the word) he even feels the game is limited when he can't have tons of rules and bonuses to hunt. I feel the game is actually limited whan I have to deal with all that to get the character I want to play, and J does too at some point. T also seems to unintentionally misread most of the rules to his advantage, but doesn't make a fuzz when he's corrected. Also, he's got a knack for breaking systems. Broke ours with a debuffer necromancer on the first playtest, that made us re-think the whole conditions for the game, previously based on 5e advantage/disadvantage mechanic.<br/><br/>-We are all loving 5e, but we're definitely not using it as a base for our hack, at least not yet.<br/><br/>So, any ideas on how to please three different players with a single game design? We do have some of our own, but some may not be completely working, that's why I'm asking the advice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438265/#Comment_438265" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-11T11:36:26+00:00" title="September 11, 2014 11:36AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is going to sound silly given the name similarity, but have you looked at Anima Prime by Christian Griffen?<br/>* tone-wise, it's definitely got over-the-top anime.<br/>* math-wise, it's deep but not demanding. If you can manage a dice pool, you just need to add up how many of your dice are over a given point. However, the system can be a lot deeper if you want to dig into it, and there's a lot of room for adding bonuses and such. There's room to try to powergame and with the game firmly in the story game tradition, it's hard to firmly break and even if you do, overpowered combos does not kill the game.<br/>Basically: it's tonally right (works similarly off of a heavy FF and shonen anime base), mechanically simple, deep, and flexible, and it's quite hackable should you want things changed around.<br/><br/>Oh, and the art-free version of the game is free through Creative Commons.

Whenever someone tries to compromise (which is what serving more than one master is), they ruin perfection of the few in lieu of average to broken for the many. This was my fundamental issue with 5e from the beginning.<br/><br/>Now, 5e said they were going to solve the issue not through compromise, but through modularity. That way people would be able to mix and match components to arrive at exactly the play style they were interested in. While I applaud the idea, in practice that's essentially impossible because so many elements of game play are systemically inherent and either can't be changed, or don't work properly when fitted to other elements.<br/><br/>The bottom line, for me, is that people who want different types of gaming will only be well served by a system that fits their specific wants. Now some like many different things, or have only a mild to moderate preference, which lets them compromise on system and still have a good time. However they are not truly being fully fulfilled.<br/><br/>Case in point: I am a MAJOR simulationist, OCD, detail/math/fiddly-bit person who can deeply enjoy gamist elements (especially meta-gamist system mastery). My friend is a free-form, ABSOLUTELY anti-math narrativist who seldom even reads rules, never mind gaining mastery of them for meta purposes. Fortunately we can both give a bit, or fake it at least, so we often play together and have fun. However neither of us is ever truly happy with a single system. I'll ALWAYS want more math and detail for simulation, and he'll ALWAYS want simple and less for narration.<br/><br/>When it comes to game design we try to be honest about the specific goal up front, and then build for that. Once that's done we decide if there are optional modular elements that can be used to achieve some degree of compromise. Sometimes we don't believe the compromise works for the game, and it remains purely one or the other, requiring the 'left out' player to just not play that game, or accept a lowered level of enjoyment during it.<br/><br/>Once in a while we hit upon a pretty system that kind of serves both sides in some way. We did this when we came up with our MandE framework for Stupid Heroes. Unfortunately it has a lot of elements some people detest (table based resolution, heavy dm and/or player fiat, etc), and can only mesh with certain games and play styles (though its mechanical foundations required the exact opposite preferences to achieve). It also relies heavily on fiat and creative dm'ing to deal with breakage due to powergaming, but at least with the heroes game that's inherent and kind of the point, so it's not a big deal for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438268/#Comment_438268" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-11T14:15:50+00:00" title="September 11, 2014  2:15PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2014 2:16PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's a fairly straightforward way to please three players with diverging tastes.<br/><br/>1) Find the common thread.

If you can make a game that pleases all three of you, than you basically have a game that can appeal to three types of players at the same time. Now keep in mind, this will mean compromise. It won't mean a game that is the ideal game for each of you as individuals, it will mean a game that you all can enjoy together. <br/><br/>I've worked with three designers who have very different styles and tastes. Really it is no different from GMing for a room of people with different gaming sensibilities. <br/><br/>Basically find determine what all of you like in a game and also what you can tolerate. If someone really likes numbers and you don't, try to find a place where you can compromise on that point and still enjoy playing. So maybe he has to tone the math down a touch, but you also have to stomach a bit of it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438277/#Comment_438277" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-11T17:34:08+00:00" title="September 11, 2014  5:34PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you try to create something which aims to please several different goals, one view is that the ideal product will make everyone happy.

Well, in the light of our project, we realized that our differences approximate more to this  <blockquote>. Really it is no different from GMing for a room of people with different gaming sensibilities. </blockquote>\nthat's why I tend to the optimistic side of it. It means that compromise doesn't have to be a fun-breaker. We all have different kinds of fun with different parts of the game. You can have for example different mechanics for the exploration, combats and social conflicts, throw in some optional/modular mechanics to deal with the same things in other ways. Say, even when I think I had a minimalistic combat mechanics to rule them all, T added a side of combat we hadn't thought before, so we had to think of another couple mechanics to solve it. It complicated the math a bit, but I admitted I had to compromise, so we went with it. We're still trying to make heads from tails about how it all works together, while I try to convince them to think a bit more like designers and less than players, and while I try to convince myself as a GM and a designer that I should worry less about balance.<br/><br/>About Anima Prime, well, it isn't exactly a game that actually makes us crazy, but I think we may hack a couple of things from there. It's kinda outdated now with so many interesting indie stuff out there, not to mention actual japanese rpgs that capture better a lot of the feelings I'm looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438305/#Comment_438305" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-12T11:52:30+00:00" title="September 12, 2014 11:52AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know; I feel like I have to come down on the pessimistic side, because I feel like I come down on the pessimistic side of "GMing for a room of people with different gaming sensibilities." - even if the GM runs a game with great roleplay, if you get bored in long, tactical combats, you're going to be bored during the long tactical combats he puts in for the guys who like long tactical combats, while those guys are bored during the politicing roleplay sections or whatever.  <br/><br/>Even in the example you cite - you've compromised, making the game less fun for you, so that T could get a game he enjoys more.   While, yes, it's not entirely zero sum, and it might've been a small sacrifice that you made for great gains on his part, you are still pulling both extremes towards some sort of midpoint, and I'm concerned that the midpoint is going to be closer to "Eh, it's okay." than "Yeah, this is pretty cool."<br/><br/>Or, to put it another way, I don't think it's possible for this to be a GREAT game for all of you.

Seriously, it's almost like a mental condition, I do stress out when I'm around people who aren't having a good time, specially if it's because of me. That makes easier for me to compromise, but I admit that's me, I'm strange. Taking that aside and my own personal tastes, there's a moment when no matter how difficult the system, if you practice enough you get to internalize it. This goes better if you manage to have fun while learning. So instead of just yawning and crying from boredom while the tactical fight is going, players of social PCs can try to get what's going on and give some sort of support, and same thing can happen in reverse.<br/><br/>But let me go on your example Airk, there's something interesting happening there: there's an awful lot of designs that only allow players to empower their characters for one of the three main axis of the game: your character is either good at combat, good at exploration or good at social scenes. While not crucial, I actually consider this a bit of a design flaw.

Seriously, it's almost like a mental condition, I do stress out when I'm around people who aren't having a good time, specially if it's because of me. That makes easier for me to compromise, but I admit that's me, I'm strange. Taking that aside and my own personal tastes, there's a moment when no matter how difficult the system, if you practice enough you get to internalize it. This goes better if you manage to have fun while learning. So instead of just yawning and crying from boredom while the tactical fight is going, players of social PCs can try to get what's going on and give some sort of support, and same thing can happen in reverse.<br/><br/>But let me go on your example Airk, there's something interesting happening there: there's an awful lot of designs that only allow players to empower their characters for one of the three main axis of the game: your character is either good at combat, good at exploration or good at social scenes. While not crucial, I actually consider this a bit of a design flaw. For our design I proposed to separate the skills for these three axis and let players distribute the same amount of points on each one. The intended effect is that everyone should be able to do something in each type of scene, though it can be different things for everyone. That way the fighter can do something in a social scene and the bard can be more than useful in battle without powergaming.</blockquote>\nThis is something I disagree with in general (though I wouldn't necessarily object to a game that did it, especially in a skill or hybrid based system). <br/><br/>In D&amp;D for instance Fighters shouldn't be as useful in social situations as bards. Neither should anyone else match a ranger for tracking/trailblazing. It's the niche specialty that makes or breaks a class-based game (as opposed to a skill based one). This is where we broke from D&amp;D starting with 3rd. Anything that takes away a unique spotlight is a problem to classes.<br/><br/>Even in skill based games I think there's a lot to be said for finding a unique role in a group. In SR everyone can fight with weapons, but usually only one or two people decide to focus in it. If it were possible to be great at decking, rigging, magic, fighting, and investigation/face stuff then something about the whole 'party/group' atmosphere gets lost. Works GREAT for solo games (or to a lesser extant small groups), but not really for full size teams.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean a class shouldn't be able to second-fiddle. Druid can heal a bit if there's no cleric, Paladin can tank social settings on pure faith and determination when a bard is absent, anyone can swing and 'hit it again', etc. It's not a problem to let people dabble, but they should never achieve the level of success (or the unique fun element) that the niche gives to that specific class. SR is good example of a game that manages this BRILLIANTLY while still retaining niche roles. <br/><br/>Part of the fun (for us) is to find the ways (usually through roleplaying) that a character can become useful out of niche. While the bard is schmoozing a bar for gossip the fighter can be inconspicuously watching for reactions, or dealing with equipment upkeep, or he can act the drunk dullard spilling information or giving false information while the bard watches for the reactions, etc. Point being you don't have to be the one making the important or best roll to participate. Roleplay, for us, is a more important skill than the mechanical things that give modifiers or target numbers. Doing it that way allows the classes to retain their uniqueness while everyone still gets to participate at any time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438313/#Comment_438313" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-12T18:24:54+00:00" title="September 12, 2014  6:24PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't know; I feel like I have to come down on the pessimistic side, because I feel like I come down on the pessimistic side of "GMing for a room of people with different gaming sensibilities." - even if the GM runs a game with great roleplay, if you get bored in long, tactical combats, you're going to be bored during the long tactical combats he puts in for the guys who like long tactical combats, while those guys are bored during the politicing roleplay sections or whatever.  <br/><br/>Even in the example you cite - you've compromised, making the game less fun for you, so that T could get a game he enjoys more.   While, yes, it's not entirely zero sum, and it might've been a small sacrifice that you made for great gains on his part, you are still pulling both extremes towards some sort of midpoint, and I'm concerned that the midpoint is going to be closer to "Eh, it's okay." than "Yeah, this is pretty cool."<br/><br/>Or, to put it another way, I don't think it's possible for this to be a GREAT game for all of you.  Certainly, it can be a game all of you will ACCEPT, but I fear that you'll always be thinking "I wish we were playing ".</blockquote>\nIf you have a whole group that is on the same exact page in terms of preferences, and those preferences never change over time, certainly a system focused to their particular desires will work fine. In my experience most game groups are made up of a wide variety of players and one of the skills needed to GM is the ability to appease this diversity of tastes and expectations. That is a delicate balance and sometimes it means you have to mix things up. Generally if you know player A <i>hates</i> long tactical battles, but player B <i>loves</i> long tactical battles, you are probably better off giving player B a taste of that but not indulging it so much that player A is bored to tears. But I think not only are most groups diverse, most individual players also have a diversity of tastes and interests and are not easily pigeon-holed, so in my experience running games, this sort of approach works very well. It isn't going to work for everyone, but I think it is a recipe for a game with broad appeal. Because the poster is trying to balance three different sets of preferences, I think he will likely end up with a game that three different kinds of players can enjoy (and I just think it is more common to have a mixed group of preferences at a given table than a unified set of preferences). Personally I quite like being in a game where a number of different styles get some amount of representation. It seems to generate more fun overall for me.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438316/#Comment_438316" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-12T22:59:29+00:00" title="September 12, 2014 10:59PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 to Bedrockbrendan. I mean, there can't possibly be a game with a rulebook that a person loves from the cover to the back and uses every single rule and option at it's fullest in it all the time. I mean, even if you play with 3.5 encumbrance rules, I haven't heard of GMs that use it all the time. If at least one does, there has to be at least a couple of monsters, magic items or prestige classes he doesn't use or allow in his/her game. I don't think that even designers play their own games using the complete content every single time.<br/><br/>So what do we do, in general, either as players and GMs? We adapt to the group. It's part compromise, part tolerance and part going a bit out of your comfort zone and try things that other people of your group like, and showing to them yours. Doing this doesn't have to be a warranty of a bad experience, and in my experience it works more often than not.<br/><br/>I think I could take a long tactical battle as long as the GM and the players keep it interesting. If all the fighter player does is say "I attack it with my axe" and roll dice turn after turn for three hours straight, I'll be the first to call it a night and go home though, and I don't believe you could blame me. If I'm the fighter and the bard hoards the spotlight for an hour and doesn't even let me roleplay my dumb axe wielder a bit, or even worse, just makes fun of me and I can't shut him because he's more <i>intimidating </i>than me (and today I still can get how this could be possible in the fiction, but ruleswise it was more than possible) well, you can't blame me for asking when the combat starts.<br/><br/>Because any GM would be doing a poor job by letting a single kind of scene last for a whole session.<br/><br/>Now, phoenix, I get your point, that everyone has their right to shine in their own moment. So far we found that our idea doesn't take away that from the game at all. We just have a wider array choices, so everyone fights in a different way and there each one can focus on different things, but no-one is a dead weight in a fight. In the exploration scenes, I love how D&amp;D 5e backgrounds give everyone a chance to shine in different ways. There the fighter could take the Soldier background, which means that he can be recognized by other soldiers in the setting and can even ask them for information or some minor help without charisma rolls. There are also a lot of games out there that let combat-oriented characters intimidate with their combat skills, I mean, it's common sense, and I see even you are implementing this in your games without resorting to a written rule, but more to an unspoken rule of "it makes sense, you're big, are holding a weapon and your oponent doesn't" -and you would be surprised of how many GMs I have found that still stick to the RAW and don't let fighters properly intimidate without the exact feats and stats.<br/><br/>Yet we aren't going for great bonuses on too much mechanical stuff. What we have now is still a sort of a mix between World of Dungeons, Fate, Song of Ice and Fire RPG and some other stuff. We aren't even aiming for something trad or commercial, we just want to have fun and we have realized that no matter what game, <i>we have the best fun whenever we all play together.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438393/#Comment_438393" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-16T14:03:31+00:00" title="September 16, 2014  2:03PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recognize that everyone has different tastes and all, but the point being that since your tastes are so far apart, you're not going to be able to craft a game that all of you "really like" and I think that's pretty much all there is to it.

Actually one have just happened under the most strange circumstances. Another friend of us -JL- asked my friend J. to fix a game JL had made like 14 years ago. We all have played that game and agree that we hate how JL railroads (we can collaborate and can be okay with railroading, it's just that JL a poor excuse of a railroading GM) and how badly his game was designed even taking this into account. J ended up redesigning the game and to my surprise, using lots of the stuff T. and I like in a game. So we started to help him out and now we're ditching our old design to adapt other games to this new one. Admittedly, it's fair for the tastes of only three people so far, and it may not be terribly creative on some stuff, but it seems like it could work for our different purposes and gaming styles. On top of that it has allowd us to learn a lot more about each other and exactly how different are our tastes and how can we mix them together without ruining the fun for each other.<br/><br/>So, while not an exercise I'd reccomend if you're not tolerant enough to listen others before thinking that you won't like what they like, it's still an experience I'd reccomend you all to try.

A game has clear needs and objectives, and should be put together to maximize those.<br/><br/>However, I also think it's a bit limiting to say, "Hey, the three of us have different preferences, and therefore we'll never enjoy playing a game together." Sure, we all have preferences, but some are really important/major, and others are just flavours we might do well with or without.<br/><br/>Rather, the key is for each player to understand what the game being played is for, how it ticks, and play that game to the fullest. I may be a huge chess fanatic, but it doesn't mean I can't enjoy going to the beach to play volleyball with my friends. <br/><br/>The problem starts when one game is assumed to be the "be-all-end-all" of all gaming ever, and expected to fulfill everyone's needs simultaneously. <br/><br/>Understand what you're playing and why you're playing it, communicate that clearly to each other, and enjoy the crap out of each game/session/group as it comes.  <br/><br/>I don't believe that human beings have absolutely inflexible desires and needs, and no room to appreciate other activities or other approaches to their favoured activities.<br/><br/>Start with that realization, and I'm sure you guys will have a fine time together.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438505/#Comment_438505" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-18T11:51:48+00:00" title="September 18, 2014 11:51AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not really sure what the moral of that story was supposed be, but it's BY listening to people that I tend to conclude that they don't enjoy the same things I do.

Apparently it's quite controversial, this issue of how to proceed when different members of the group are looking for different things.<br/><br/>I had two discussions about this which I remember well:<br/><br/>One with Ron Edwards in 2006.  My takeaways: Having a shared agenda for play is pretty important.  Without one, a gaming get-together can still be fun, but you run some risks of clash and incoherence, where people fight over what the game's about, or tune out because the game isn't giving them what they expected or hoped for.  There's plenty of failed roleplaying out there, and a lot of it stems from this.<br/><br/>One with Zak S in 2011.  My takeaways: There are plenty of ways to make the gaming get-together fun while taking turns giving different players what they want.  Sometimes a GM can pull this off by doling out spotlight time and desired content per player as befits the flow and vibe of the moment.  Many toolbox-game GMs are good at this, and many of their groups are on board with it.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't see a disagreement about what's possible, only about what's desirable.  Zak's fun and Ron's fun are different -- I find Ron's fun more satisfying creatively, but Zak's fun can be an easier formula for a relaxed hang when I'm with a GM who's into it.<br/><br/>I try to approach different games the way Paul described -- "Lets give this game a shot to see how I like it," rather than, "Let's be sure to pick a game that is <i>exactly</i> what I'm looking for."  Unfortunately, my group has so many game options to choose from, that isn't always well-received.  Most of my buddies have no interest in leaving their comfort zones just for the sake of trying something that I think is neat, on the off chance they'll like it too.  For a 20-minute board game, no prob, but a full-evening RPG is usually deemed too much commitment for such an experiment.  A campaign even moreso.<br/><br/>Pardon the abstract musing. <br/><br/>Regarding your situation, WarriorMonk, it looks to me like your group's conflict is about the mode and activities of play rather than the point of play.  I'd guess that y'all can contribute to the fiction harmoniously, it's just a question of how that contribution is made.  To that end, I'd be curious to see you try different rules for different players/characters.  My D&amp;D groups basically did this by letting the creative problem-solvers play spell-casters while the lovers of simple options played fighters.  Different character classes chosen, different mechanics applied.  Would you want to concoct a game with (e.g.) really crunchy mechanics for archery and really simple yes-and/no-but mechanics for social encounters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438528/#Comment_438528" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-18T22:24:09+00:00" title="September 18, 2014 10:24PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's an interesting idea.

Funny that both the takaways you mentioned are important points on our design right now. Also, one good thing about not trying to make a way too impressive/totally original system is that we're all feeling like it's on our comfort zone, since all pieces (despite coming from different sources) feel totally familiar to all of us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
