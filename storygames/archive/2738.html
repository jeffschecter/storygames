Speak to me of the feedback you gave and received.  Did you comment on designs outside your feedback group?  Did you follow particular entries?  Did you track down the games of freinds or people you were interested in following?  What percentage of your group finished and submitted their games?  What was the range in design techniques in your group?  <br/><br/>I was in group Sigma, and it was a positive experience.  I found that I couldn't give as much, or as rigorous, feedback as I would have liked, due to the volume of entries and the busy-ness of my life.  I found myself answering specific questions rather than looking at designs holistically.  Similarly, the feedback I got was encouraging but typically addressed specific mechanical questions I posed.  I thought we had a very positive vibe and there was no drama at all.<br/><br/>I followed a couple of games outside my own group - a couple of friends and a couple of designs that caught my eye that I really wanted to encourage.  <br/><br/>Our group will have entries ranging from fairly traditional to GM-less and a little experimental.  I found it difficult to provide solid feedback for the designs that were outside my current enthusiasms, which is something I'd like to work on for next year.  <br/><br/>It's looking like group Sigma will be running about 50% in terms of final submissions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62654/#Comment_62654" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-01T10:13:14+00:00" title="April  1, 2007 10:13AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2007 10:14AM by Caesar_X.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in group Unicron and found that the energy level really shifted during the competition.  The first weekend it was a huge lovefest and everyone was helping everyone else out with their games.  If I didn't post something every 24 hours someone was cool enough to ping me.  But after the first weekend I hit the reality of my very busy job and couldn't spend much if any time on my game, much less anyone else's.  When I checked back in the second weekend there was much less feedback.  But iago (Fred Hicks) seemed to have enough energy to write a complete game and give at least support if not feedback to everyone in our group.  Props.<br/><br/>But the interesting thing was that I was seeing some nice group cross-over postings.  Gareth Blackstock not only gave me continuing feedback on my mechanical questions, but he even created a nice layout for my 'Star Chart' instead of letting future players of my game be subjected to my terrible MS Paint skills.<br/><br/>I followed a few games outside of my group but I think I wasn't alone in being overwhelmed by the sheer number of cool games being created all at once.  Not sure how many submissions will come out of our group but I would guess around 30-50%.<br/><br/>Overall I think the groups were a great idea.  I have this feeling that going back to one week (perhaps with two weekends) might reduce the overwhelming factor and help people focus more on getting something down on paper.<br/><br/><i></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mytholder" title="mytholder"><img alt="mytholder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mytholder">mytholder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62666/#Comment_62666" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-01T17:38:12+00:00" title="April  1, 2007  5:38PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Is this my first time posting here?

I tried commenting on everyone in my group as much as possible, and when I found time, I'd comment on stuff by people I knew in other groups, or on games that seemed interesting. There was definitely a sort of feedback loop - the games that got the most buzz (like Grover Cleveland) would attract more attention, and so get more comments, giving them longer comment threads, hence more buzz. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the Thetas have three games submitted, which is around a 30% completion rate. I think that'll be true across the board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62667/#Comment_62667" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-01T18:02:01+00:00" title="April  1, 2007  6:02PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2007 6:02PM by Remi.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just posted mine.

I tried to give out as much feedback as I received, but I probably fell short of that. Hopefully some of what I said was helpful.<br/><br/>I didn't post much feedback outside of my group, but there were several games that I followed due to the people involved or the damn cool concepts I was seeing. I hope to be able to find a couple of the games that I really like after the contest and help out a bit with any further development that takes place.<br/><br/>Group Mu currently has 8 of 15 members with completed games. A couple more before the deadline would be great. I know several of our members did a great job helping out everyone in the group and really being supportive. I'm sure that played a large role in our completion rate.<br/><br/>We've got a great range of games in Mu - from my game for kids ages 5 to 8, several awesome GMless designs, and a couple GMful designs with great settings.<br/><br/>I am really excited to do my reviews and read as many other games as I can. It was a great contest this year!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62670/#Comment_62670" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-01T19:34:00+00:00" title="April  1, 2007  7:34PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in Group Omega.

Like everyone, I was short on time blah, blah, blah. And spring fever has hit me. I'm finding it hard to get anything done and my ability to give feedback was hindered by my inability to concentrate. I got okay feedback, mostly encouragement. And I got some great last minute feedback which made the game text much better.\n<blockquote> Did you comment on designs outside your feedback group?</blockquote>\nI think I commented once on Graham's game, but that was it. I suck.\n<blockquote>Did you follow particular entries? </blockquote>\nNo. It was hard enough keeping up with Group Gamma's stuff. Everything else was a blur.\n<blockquote>Did you track down the games of freinds or people you were interested in following?</blockquote>\nNot really. Everyone that did the contest I only know via online. I did drop in to see what the big names in indie were churning out.\n<blockquote>What percentage of your group finished and submitted their games?</blockquote>\nGamma ended up with only four games submitted. The lowest of all the groups. 26% I believe.\n<blockquote>What was the range in design techniques in your group?</blockquote>\nIt ranged from hippy peace, love, and enlightenment to traditional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62676/#Comment_62676" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-01T22:40:07+00:00" title="April  1, 2007 10:40PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2007 10:48PM by Kynn.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I got far more feedback than I gave, and I feel horrible about that.</i><br/><br/>Me too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62681/#Comment_62681" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-02T04:52:21+00:00" title="April  2, 2007  4:52AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was my first year.

I also rather like the "done in a rush" feel of Game Chef games, and think extending the time span perhaps allows people to indulge themselves a bit with layout, editing and playtesting when I'd rtaher just see raw innovative concept thrown against the wall. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd cautiously advocate a sort of "two long weekends" model, where the contest runs starting from like midnight Thursday, runs through a full week and then finishes up midnight Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback groups... worked well, I guess, in that they broke the incredibly size of the contest into manageable brain-chunks, but I still felt overwhelmed, and like I didn't have an overall grasp on the contest and the variety of stuff out there.

I would say that most of my game has been thought or written in hotels, trains, airports or planes.<br/><br/>I missed the first enthusiast boom. I really noticed it when I tried to catch-up, reading old threads from other games in my group, and a couple of them more, outside it. I also noticed that some of the game ideas were already too mature for my quick reading and casual feedback. Thus, I tried to be at least supportive when other thing was not possible.<br/>Joining later is also a hinder for getting feedback, but I still got very nice advice.

So, from the point of view of a Chef Chef newbie:<br/><br/>I liked the feedback groups, but I might suggest making them a touch larger -- maybe cap out at 20 people rather than 15.  Starting at 15, and then having people either drop out or take time off the forum to work on their game, my group felt much less busy during the second week.  On the other hand, that might just contribute more to the "so much awesome stuff, not enough time to check it out" vibe.<br/><br/>I followed other threads on occasion -- mainly people I knew or threads I was pointed to -- but I didn't do anything in depth with them.<br/><br/>Fred Hicks and Gareth Blackstock have nigh-unending reserved of energy.<br/><br/>The fact that it was two weeks long mean that: (a) with all the other things I had to do, I could get the time to do Game Chef and (b) it caused me to push a lot of things off for two weeks instead of one.  Double-edged sword.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: orklord</cite>I tried really hard to give good feedback, but I had trouble relating with most of the game concepts I read.  I felt like I was reading a thesis discussion at times.  I got much better feedback than I ever gave.  I wish I could have been a better teammate.</blockquote>\nI had a similar problem with some of the posts I was reading, and only on one did I say (and only after someone else did) that I didn't quite understand where they were going.  I felt bad for saying that because I didn't want to rain on their game &amp; energy, even when what I wanted to convey was "Dude, there's something freaking awesome here -- I can feel it.  Problem is I don't know what that is."  So on some threads I kept my mouth shut.  I also can't read lengthy chucks of text online very well.  Those posts tend to match the games where I was confused, so I couldn't exactly put the "blame" squarely on the designer.<br/><br/>Single negative experience:  Being told "Where's the fun?" about my game without any constructive criticism &amp; being told that my resolution mechanic should involve "cockpunching."  But that's (a) what you get if you use any public forum and (b) not a problem with Game Chef.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62720/#Comment_62720" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-02T16:29:57+00:00" title="April  2, 2007  4:29PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>my resolution mechanic should involve "cockpunching."</blockquote>\nMaybe you could try out your innovative cockpunch-based resolution system on the guy who suggested that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62721/#Comment_62721" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-02T16:33:46+00:00" title="April  2, 2007  4:33PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Maybe you could try out your innovative cockpunch-based resolution system on the guy who suggested that.</blockquote>\nSomething I'll definitely keep in mind when I need playtesters for "Drunken Irish Game Designer the RPG".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62722/#Comment_62722" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-02T17:10:24+00:00" title="April  2, 2007  5:10PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought it went well over all, but my group Epsilon seemed kind of dead.

My first game chef, and I finished, so that's gotta be something. <br/><br/>It was tough to keep up with the feedback-giving -- I ended up giving quite a bit of feedback to some people, but then others would slip through the cracks of my attention. Basically, the earlier you got your concept up and decided on, the more likely people were going to stick with you and be able to offer truly comprehensive (I think someone used the word 'holistic', as well) feedback. And while both kinds of feedback are useful, I felt I was really being helpful when I could contribute some insight into the game as a whole, or the text as a whole, or whatever. And doing that for 12 other people is basically impossible. On the other hand the best single bit of 'feedback' I got was when a group member posted a 'Everyone write an example of play' thread -- I basically sat down and wrote out the core rules of my game in 'example' format and suddenly realised I might be able to finish a game after all. So sometimes instigation and encouragement are even better than analysis.<br/><br/>I do think bigger groups might be an improvement, even though I've said that keeping up with 12 other games is impossible. I think the groups create this dilemma of responsibility that both pushes you to participate and finish your own game, and makes you feel bad when you can't keep up with feedback, etc. Of course that's something you can talk about in your group, but if a group was 30 people this expectation would basically go out the window. Is that better? I don't know. The problem with small groups is, well, what happens if you just don't 'get' anybody else's game? I felt like often that was a bigger obstacle to useful feedback than commitment, time, or energy -- sometimes you just can't think of anything to say.<br/><br/>I was following other games at the beginning -- I had a long list of bookmarked threads -- but I fell off that wagon pretty fast once things started getting going in my group. It was always nice to see cross-group feedback, whether in my own threads or in other threads -- it helped remind me that there was more going on than just my own group's stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62733/#Comment_62733" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-02T20:26:36+00:00" title="April  2, 2007  8:26PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>On the other hand the best single bit of 'feedback' I got was when a group member posted a 'Everyone write an example of play' thread </blockquote>\nThat's a great idea.<br/><br/>You (or whoever suggested it) should have shared that idea with everyone.

In my goal to remain positive and the fact that I had no previously established relationship with my group members, I ended up being quiet and giving feedback like "I think you could call the game this" or "gee, that is a neat idea".

I think it's natural, though.  From several perspectives, you're bound to get more feedback than you give, because the number of people who can give you feedback outnumber you by an order of magnitude.<br/><br/>I tried to get in there and at least give *one* specific comment about *one* aspect of a game whenever possible.  Even if it was something as simple as, "You've got a killer hook here; I think you should focus on that killer hook, and make it the central part of your game. Anything else is just window-dressing to that."  Or whatever.  Tell people what it is that EXCITES you, and leave it to them to figure out whether that's important and whether to take steps to maximize that excitement.<br/><br/>In SOME cases I saw a clear path to how to make improvements, but as often as not, I didn't.  I think that's natural as well.  When you aren't the one designing something, you don't have the system growing like some strange organic beastie in your brain -- you don't know its DNA.  So it's better in my view to say to people, "HEY, THIS THING RIGHT HERE IS AWESOME" and then walk away, leaving them to figure out what to do about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62780/#Comment_62780" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T10:51:19+00:00" title="April  3, 2007 10:51AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite> the number of people who can give you feedback outnumber you by an order of magnitude.</blockquote>\nTechnically, two orders of magnitude, as there were 100+ people in the contest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62781/#Comment_62781" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T10:58:07+00:00" title="April  3, 2007 10:58AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I kept thinking 'these guys make games all the time, I've never made one, so I better keep my mouth shut with my questions about "Where's the fun?"'</blockquote>\nMan...don't think that. Give feedback. If it bothers you, only feed back on the bits you like, or ask questions like "If I was running this game, how would this work?". <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I completely understand where you're coming from. But people really appreciate feedback, and it doesn't matter how much gaming design experience you've got.

She isn't a woman, but a serious f***ing post writing machine.</i><br/>Cheers to that!  Jess was one of a bunch of folks who gave insane amounts of feedback and started threads that helped folks watch each other's back. I was glad for ones like Echo's life preserver thread. I made sure to check it regularly and monitor those games.  Especially later in the contest I wasn't always able to give in depth feedback but if you bump somebody's thread it's often picked up by at least a person or two more.  There were some folks, like Arturo G. who I noticed were posting a lot to these threads and I tried to go check their games out too. I did check in on friends, but was rarely one of their primary responders out of my group. I didn't even realize until half way through that one person in my group was a good friend! The pseudonyms did a good job of reducing friend-bias.<br/><br/>I got a ton of feedback, from in and out of my group (The_Hitcher, for example, gave me one fantastic feedback post that helped me figure out what the heck I was going to do for mechanics), and I'm sure that part of the reason why was that I had given feedback outside at the start. I know I was likely to seek out the games of people who had taken the time to read mine even if they were in another group so I bet that was part of it for others too.  <br/><br/>I love the fact that there was a general aesthetic in the game entries to keep them simple. Especially since we had two weeks.  I had already turned mine in before I started looking around at other finished versions, and felt like I'd overdressed my game with a couple images and color borders. Here I thought I was being restrained! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>All in all, a great year.  I'd suggest keeping the feedback groups &amp; Vanilla forum, implementing constraints again and maybe increasing the group size a bit as has been already been suggested.  Requiring minimal layout and formatting would be something good to consider too. The games this year show that it's perfectly possible to be clean and attractive whilst being plain and simple, making a more even playing field for the games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62806/#Comment_62806" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T13:36:40+00:00" title="April  3, 2007  1:36PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it just me or did groups with 'group leaders' do better feedback-wise than groups without that centralized person pushing?

Lots of "what do you think about my game?" questions, which really you can only say "it looks good!" so many times before it's a worthless response. I didn't see many people asking for help with specific issues, which made it much harder to focus.

I shudder with that idea!!<br/><br/>I also agree with Graham that explicit authority may derive in a bad-bias, something that I perfectly know it happens in peer-to-peer reviewing in other fields. But it is not only about reviewing. During the contest, the feedback may be not so natural. It is very easy to assume that someone you are crediting with authority is more clever than you (which, in general, is not the case), and become more shy to do good criticism about her work.<br/><br/>But you see, in group Tau, Mr. Teapot was doing a kind of very nice "heating up" job during the mid-part of the contest, without generating such authority role. I think this is important. Some leadership, in the sense that someone is generating threads like the "elevator pitch", or "post an example of play", is also important. A good mix of experienced people and newbies should create the appropriate dynamics. But you never know. The appropriate commitment is not always possible for everyone, and you only discover how much can you get involved when you are on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62863/#Comment_62863" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T02:03:48+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  2:03AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>It may just be my personality, but it bugs the heck out of me that almost all of my useful feedback came from my friends outside Group Xi.

final consensus is that emergent (i.e., "natural") leadership in the feedback groups isn't enough to produce the level of design support that's desired, but designating such leaders may result in a kind of attention bias ("Hey, I know her! I'll pay more attention to her stuff!"), a possible solution is to solicit and designate non-participant "feedback leaders" whose job it is to jumpstart the process of communication within each group. They sit out the contest proper (neither designing nor judging), but receive the warm and grateful thanks of the participants, and may proudly speak of "My Life With Master Chef."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62873/#Comment_62873" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T05:13:35+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  5:13AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, what I think you're saying is that Game Chef isn't an effective venue, because communicating with strangers isn't helpful to you in the design process.

Since Game Chef is, at its base, explaining your game ideas to others, a functional feedback group should be extremely helpful.<br/><br/>The most valuable thing a group leader can do in an environment like Game Chef is give a solid example of how to give good feedback. It can be taught, and it was this example that was lacking from my group.<br/><br/>Bill: I think one of the strengths of the current emergent leadership is that they are participants in the contest, and their example of how they receive and build on feedback is equally useful to the example they set giving feedback. OTOH, as Graham points out, there is a real danger to an assigned leader becoming a focal point for all criticism.<br/><br/>I think, ultimately, this is my problem and my guilt.

When people start tapping in, he should (and he did) assign at least one experienced game publisher to each group.  Then he should gie a blanket statement like this, "Okay, you with game design experience need to step up and be the leader for your group.  It's up to you to make sure everyone gets some feedback and to be the captain of your group's cheerleader squad.  Set and example for your group."

While I'm not sure I agree that Game Chef is actually <em>about</em> explaining your idea to others (I feel like it is more importantly about <em>writing a game fast as a creative exercise</em>), let's assume for the sake of discussion that I do.</p>\n<p>So, like, how do we find out if we are explaining well?

That's because feedback directly interferes with writing your own game; the conflict of interest is endlessly frustrating, and I think that by separating them, you enable people to think more clearly and work more nimbly. I know that, right now, I am much more excited about doing feedback for my group's games than I was while I still had Sacred Bone work that I needed to do as well.</p></li>\n<li><p>Group leaders are cool.

I'm not trying to close off this discussion by offering The Solution; I'm trying to extend it by offering an alternative whose pros and cons can be weighed with respect to other options. As Emily points out, the problem may be a non-problem, in that feedback this year seemed to be higher on average than in previous years. To the extent that it's a problem, different solutions may have drawbacks:<br/><br/>(1) Do nothing. Expect that "emergent leaders" in each group will pop up as needed to encourage and facilitate feedback. The drawback is that this doesn't fix the "problem," because some groups will have weak leaders.<br/>(2) Assign an official "feedback facilitator" role to one or more participants in a group. The drawback here is as stated: it focuses attention on and perhaps biases the judging of "more equal" participants.<br/>(3) Assign an official "feedback facilitator" role to one or more non-participants in each group. The drawback here is as you say: part of what's exemplary about the role is how they receive as much as how they give feedback.<br/><br/>Once it's laid out like this, we can talk about which drawback we think is worse, and hopefully that discussion will inform what the Master Chef decides to do for next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62905/#Comment_62905" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T09:27:56+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  9:27AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This year, as far as feedback went, was INFINITELY better for me than the past two years.  Under Andy's leadership and growing interest in Game Chef, the contest has gotten much bigger than in the first three years on the Forge where everybody basically knew everyone else.<br/><br/><i>The contest has not always been about getting feedback from strangers.</i>  Originally, you were getting feedback from a bunch of folks that you'd been talking to for at least the past 6 months, if not years.  Even when we had 30 participants, this was still often the case.  Now that we have almost 200, no chance.<br/><br/>It's possible that Shreyas (and, to a lesser extent, myself) is missing the already existing sense of community and at least moderate familiarity that surrounded the process in its initial incarnation.

I've been assuming that groups are more-or-less randomly created, but there's a "social engineering" option that involves seeding groups with folks who are known quantities in terms of their ability and willingness to set the example and facilitate feedback.

I'd be working on a game, Ben would be working on a game.  And we'd read each other's stuff as it was posted (or after the contest, in the feedback thread) and comment on it.  Also, we'd get comments from everybody else on the Forge who was watching the action with bated breath.  (Honestly, I feel like I don't need peer reviews this year.  I already got a ton of feedback from the people within my group, who are all smart, thoughtful people.  More would be nice, sure, but I don't NEED it.)<br/><br/>Originally, the only person who read and scored the games was Mike Holmes.  And his reading and scoring was like Drew Carey's moderator role on <i>Who's Line Is It Anyway?</i>, where the scoring rules were made up (more or less arbitrarily by Mike, though he tried to explain his decisions) and the points really didn't matter.  The game that won was not always the general favorite of the participants.  Sometimes it was one that Mike happened to particularly dig.  This isn't meant as a knock to the early Game Chef winners.  All the games that were in the running to win were completely badass.  But was one more obviously badass than others?  Not really.  And the similarity to the Academy Awards, where no one's ever quite a shoe-in, was fun.<br/><br/>So anything that hints of a true competition, where people are out to win, or things that require folks to do more than  make a shot at designing a cool game and being supportive of the folks around them?  Not so critical to the original spirit, I don't think.<br/><br/>Now, like I said, clearly the contest has changed and, as a part of that process, I feel the spirit of the contest has changed too.  Whether or not that's a good thing is arguable.  But I think, just like any good game design, people involved in thinking about and making plans for Game Chef in the future need to consider what are the critical, core components and emphasize them.  The rest?  Not so important.<br/><br/>Honestly, I feel like the whole contest aspects are better as a kind of "fruitful void."  You win bragging rights, sure, but it doesn't really matter.  We could determine the winner by a random die roll and I would be almost as happy, honestly.  What matters is what you do after Game Chef, even if that includes scrapping your Game Chef game and working on a different project.  What matters is that Game Chef shows you that you can do this (again, IMO).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62955/#Comment_62955" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T13:25:28+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  1:25PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Game Chef would be cool with a prize and I also like the idea of a Game Chef Competitor "crest" to go on games that end up publishing that were created in Game Chef (as I suggested in my interview with Andy, but he wisely sidestepped that one).<br/><br/>I also think that an author who publishes a game cooked up in Game Chef should donate a copy each year to be hoarded into the Game Chef winner prize.  Each year, someone who published a game would kick a copy to the Master Chef and the Master Chef divvies it up amongst the prizes as he or she sees fit.  That would rock.<br/><br/>And IMHO having a designated leader for each group is a better idea than emergent, as some groups this year saw, if you just hope for an emergent leader, you might end up with a quiet group (but Omega rocked).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62983/#Comment_62983" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T15:05:00+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  3:05PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>I wonder whether Andy tried to do this?</blockquote>\nActually, yeah.

You win!", my attitude about the contest is totally not about the WINNAR. Even though I took a few pains to make sure that things were even in terms of scoring (which I realized recently was actually nothing more than a knee-jerk subconscious reaction after doing 3 years of the Indie RPG Awards processes), I'm hoping that I haven't put a big effort on the Winner or even the Winner's Circle for the awards.<br/><br/>Here's what I focus on.<br/><br/>* First, any time I ever, EVER talk about the Game Chef thing, I make sure to emphasize that it's just about joining in and trying your hand at writing a game, especially if you have always wanted to yet never gotten around to it. Also, I always emphasize that out of all the previous "winners", the games that got polished, rewritten, and published to relative success have NOT been the "winners", but rather just some guy who liked his game and kept on keepin' on. That, to me, is the biggest indicator that this competition is a huge success, and worth continuing year after year.<br/><br/>* Write a game. Put some words on paper. Doesn't matter if your game is ready for primetime (in fact, the last two games I submitted were absolutely "incomplete", this year's entry horrendously so), just give it a shot. Try it out.<br/><br/>* If you need help, feedback is always available. Nowadays, it's easier to get feedback if you want it, because you can get it from people in your feedback group!<br/>** On this:  I wanted to prevent the situation where Newbie A really needs help on his game. I dunno, figuring out the hit points on his Ligers or someshit.  But his request for help gets no response. Meanwhile, folks are falling all over Emily or Jonathan or Ben's Hot New Thing. This always seemed to happen to some small degree in the past two years (mainly because there was just too many people to follow, and it was easy to fall through the cracks).<br/>** And while I put a lot of emphasis on this "safety net for outsiders", and made it a goal to reward the folks who help out the most, I never really made it a goal to Make People Request Feedback, or create a feedback lovefest where it wasn't needed. &lt;-- Ex: Someone PMed me and said, "Groups X and Y harly have any feedback threads!  What's wrong?  Maybe you should combine those groups so that they make more threads!"  My response was: "This contest isn't a blog, where the Most Posts Wins.  If there's no threads, then Awesome: They don't need any help. The groups aren't there to create unneeded traffic. They're only there to make sure the Danny Newbie gets help if they really really need it, without being drowned out or falling through the cracks".<br/><br/>Hopefully, I'm meeting those goals.<br/><br/>I'm iffy on "team leaders", for the reasons I mentioned in the part above regarding Not Caring if Groups Don't Generate Posts, as long as folks get help if they need it.  Instead of making it a rule, I'd probably just request that someone, if they have the time, build up some heat in your group. Create a few friendly threads, whatever.  The leaders will emerge naturally. And if there's no leaders, then that's still OK, again as long as some new guy with no Forge or RPGnet or TheRPGSite friends who wanders in can get equal peer support if they need it.<br/><br/>Oh, next year?

That said, reading through it did leave me with a few unfiltered thoughts...<br/><br/>First off, I think talk about reducing the number of entrants to Game Chef proper is the worst kind of exclusionary bullshit.  If you want to perpetuate the illusion that story/indie games are an elitist enterprise, pursue this.  Otherwise jettison it from your idea-set with all due haste.  The small press scene needs open doors, not closed ones.  Entry fees are a fast track not only to closing them, but to locking them, forcing the people who won't pay to press their noses up against the glass and watch the rich enjoy their meals while they huddle in the cold.  <br/><br/>My vision of Game Chef's role is that it is an inclusive enterprise.  Anything that undercuts inclusion is going to set off big flashing alarms in my brain, and I just saw one go off as I read through.<br/><br/>I agree that Game Chef is also about getting started writing games (or: empowering everyone to write games), but it IS about creating the most fertile environment possible for that to occur, and that means that the people you're working alongside are definitely a strength, part of the point.  I'm almost tempted to suggest that anonymity be "enforced" (or at least thoroughly encouraged) next time around, to eliminate folks' notions of who's a Real Designer and who's not.  I want Game Chef to be a cooperative competition among peers, with "peerhood" as thoroughly expressed/enforced as possible.<br/><br/>That said, if you're looking to do it as something with friends who get you rather than strangers who don't, [i]tell your friends to come over and look at your game.[/i]  There was definitely some cross-group feedbacking that occurred in the contest due to that, and it's a fine way to make sure you get what YOU need (as a friends-wanter) while still allowing for the wonderful alchemy that occurs with feedback from total strangers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63029/#Comment_63029" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-05T09:38:47+00:00" title="April  5, 2007  9:38AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>I'd love to see a mano-a-mano spinoff from Game Chef, certainly, but I see that as a side-item.</blockquote>\nWhen I first read the idea, I thought "maybe I could do something like this later as a Master Plan special, if no one else runs with it."

What's your Genre?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notice anything in common with these topics? They are all phrased in terms of "MY game is..." There's a lot of people commenting on these threads about their own games, but not as much commenting about other people's games. Any of these topics could have been rephrased in the same way as this other topic: "What are your favorite blurbs from the submitted games?" See what I'm saying? That thread makes you think and talk about <em>other</em> people's games. So do the post-design informal review threads that are popping up.</p>\n<p>I want to see more people talking <em>to</em> other people and less talking <em>past</em> other people. Limiting how many people can participate may be one way, but if you really don't like that, help think of other, better ways to do the same thing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63043/#Comment_63043" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-05T11:40:06+00:00" title="April  5, 2007 11:40AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So, talysman, are you going to start any such threads?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63044/#Comment_63044" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-05T11:51:17+00:00" title="April  5, 2007 11:51AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2007 11:52AM by talysman.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>We'll see.

The judging has to happen and all that.
