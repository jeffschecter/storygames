The Orc King's empire is showing signs of strain and we all can feel that it is just a matter of time before the Orc King and the Lord-Slayer once the humble orc known as The Named and He Who Slays for the Named will fight to the death.<br/><br/>The PTA game at Gen Con was just splendid.  We all got better at navigating PTA's stakes setting, not over-setting it, just stating enough in the set-up so that the narrative control given to the high card was meaningful.  Introducing a strong female character in Princess Solo amped things up and allowed me, as the Producer to do kick my players in the Issues.<br/><br/>We got to play <a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a> when Rob visited.  We made up a really wince-worthy fast food corporation called Murdah-Burger that commodified hip-hop culture and sold it back to the hood via cheese-burgers.  It was awful to behold.  The best character of the bunch, to my mind, was Bret's.  Bret always manages to break my heart with kick-ass characters.<br/><br/>His character, Crunk-Dawg, was a corporate indentured servant, bought as a child to make up for generational debt from his forefathers.<br/><br/>My gaming schedule lightened up over the summer quite a bit but now I'm hungry to get back at it.  Darkpages and Houses of the Blooded are calling to me.  Darkpages is up this Friday.<br/><br/>And you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167005/#Comment_167005" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T11:05:34+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 11:05AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I had a lighter summer as well.  <br/><br/>We played an epic zombie apocalypse game using <i>Solar System</i> rules and then lurched right into <i>3:16</i>, which has been really great so far.

At the beginning of the summer I moved from New Mexico to Seattle, and I'm still trying to get a good quality and quantity of gaming here. While I was in college I pretty much only got gaming when I was home, but when I was home there were usually at least two games a week (Monday being shorter games, Friday being a bigger campaign, plus the occasional Saturday pickup). Didn't realize how rare that was until recently.<br/><br/>My only regular game has been a pretty decent game of 4E, a little lacking in the story and character department, but fun enough. Got a chance to try Universalis (not to my taste) and play quick games of Jedi in the Vineyard and Don't Rest Your Head at DragonFlight. On the other hand, finally having a real job means buying a lot of new games. Recently it's been Agon, Roach, carry, and Primetime Adventures. I'm hoping my copy of Og makes it here by the weekend, otherwise I may have to go over to a local store and pick up Aces and Eights (Kenzer's approach to old-school-ish RPGs occasionally tickles my fancy).<br/><br/>Looks like the foreseeable future will be mostly the same: regular 4E games plus the occasional chance to play something else, or with another group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167128/#Comment_167128" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T18:10:47+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  6:10PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My summer's been pretty good gaming wise since I hadn't gamed in about 7-8 years.

I'm not sure how that's gonna work yet. <br/><br/>After that I'd like to play out our 3:16 game and see how those troopers end up. They're still happy and kill-crazy at the moment, but I think I was beginning to see some cracks in the troopers last mission. Also, I bought the pdf of Houses of the Blooded and now that is calling to me... I wasn't really expecting to like it as much as I did, but I think it might be a perfect fit for my group. In the Tragedy mode, anyhow - I don't see romance being emphasized. But espionage, treachery and vendetta?

We did manage to do a short run of old-school Traveler house-ruled to use the old Snapshot minis rules as the combat system (not really my thing).  After that, we started playing D&amp;D 4E using Keep on the Shadowfell,and brought two new (and very cool) players into the group.  I only go to play one full RPG session at Gencon (A Dirty World), and one short session of 3:16.<br/><br/>Post-con, we just did a 2 session Dirty World game, and will be launching back into 4E with a vengeance next week.<br/><br/>I'd love to work some Hellas or Maid into the schedule ASAP, but the thing I'm really looking forward to playing next is Dreadful Secrets of Candlewick Manor.<br/><br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167292/#Comment_167292" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T13:40:41+00:00" title="September  5, 2008  1:40PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, it's been a long summer that was near indistinguishable from the spring.  What have I played in the last few months? A couple games of Agon, a one-shot of Agonia, lots of Geiger Counter, three sessions of Keep on the Shadowfell with one to go, an over-the-top 3.5 hack of the Red Hand of Doom, ran 3:16 once, some drifted Mortal Coil, a game of Betrayal at House on the Hill, a session of Mist-Robed Gate, and some other stuff.<br/><br/>What do I wanna play?  Right now, I'm working on the first month of my <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/reindeer-rupees/" rel="nofollow">Zelda &amp; Ico-inspired "adventure calendar,"</a> which should be ready for an alpha playtest soon, maybe after this weekend.  The 3.5 game is going really well now, though it was off to a shakey start, so I'm excited to see where that goes.  I'm really psyched to try out Empire of Dust as soon as I can actually order it.  Mostly, though, I'm just interested in playing games with good friends I haven't seen or played with much, because they've been busy or moving or both.  Doesn't really matter what we play or don't play, as long as I get to hang with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168144/#Comment_168144" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T03:35:58+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  3:35AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Summer wasn't bad for gaming for me, even with all the conventions and getting a book finished.<br/><br/>I got to play a fair bit of <a href="http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/threesixteen/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">3:16</a> at home, GameWang and at GenCon, a really fun game of <a href="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Solipsist</a> at UK Games Expo, and a session each of <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/bti.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Breaking The Ice</a>, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D4e</a>, and <a href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/L&amp;L.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Labyrinths and Lycanthropes</a> at GameWang.<br/><br/>I'm trying to get pals together in one place for <a href="http://www.findannalise.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Annalise</a>, and also to get a playtest of Pooka's dystopian game in development.

I did an "RPG road trip" through Sweden, staying at the houses of people on the Swedish RPG forum and playing with 13 different gaming groups over the course of two weeks (a new one every day!). As a great finale, I playtested Children och the Evolution, a game written by a dude online I'd never met before, but had talked a lot with online. He was quite new to story gaming (usually being a hard core immersionist), but wanted to try it and started writing this game. It was awesome, because I had more or less constructed the entire system for him, and it worked beautifully!<br/><br/>In the fall, I'm looking forwards to continuing out campaign in Mutant: Heirs of the Apocalypse. It's a Swedish trad game set in post apocalyptic Sweden, with mutants, furries, robots and humans, in a 19th century-like society where wealth is owning many ancient artifacts (like plastic utensils, electric pen sharpeners and the dreaded Vacuum Cleaner, thought to be the most deadly weapon in ancient times). It's the awesome, and I'm not even GMing! We've been playing a pre-written campaign which has been too railroady for my tastes, but now we're plunging into the new module about pirates, and it's all sailing around experiencing adventures with no railroading. It's absolutely wonderful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168264/#Comment_168264" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T09:48:53+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  9:48AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a light summer.
