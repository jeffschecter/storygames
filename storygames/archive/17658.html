She basically was the the platonic ideal strong willed flapper woman of the roaring 20s. Under the penname of Lipstick, she chronicled her nightly escapades across New York City speakeasies drinking, dining, and dancing writing with loads of wicked sexual innuendo and humor which was quite "unbecoming a lady" for the day. She would come into the office early in the morning still drunk, still in her evening dress, and not having slept after a night partying. Another story from <a href="http://www.shortnorth.com/ThurberConnection.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>:\n<blockquote>One evening when managing editor Ralph Ingersoll stopped by the office after regular working hours, he was dismayed to find the magazine\u2019s star cartoonist, Peter Arno, lying naked on a sofa with \u201cTables for Two\u201d columnist, Lois Long. Years later Long said, \u201cArno and I may have been married to one another by then, I can\u2019t remember.\u201d On second thought, she added, \u201cMaybe we began drinking and forgot that we were married and had an apartment to go to.\u201d</blockquote>\nOne of her famous quotes is "Tomorrow we may die, so let's get drunk and make love."                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399878/#Comment_399878" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T18:58:39+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  6:58PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grace Jones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399886/#Comment_399886" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T19:51:14+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  7:51PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emperor Joshua Norton.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399887/#Comment_399887" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T19:51:32+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  7:51PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grace O'Malley<br/>Noor Inayat Khan<br/>Lucie Aubrac<br/>Violette Szabo                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399890/#Comment_399890" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T20:39:19+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  8:39PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Emperor Joshua Norton.</blockquote>\nOh man!
