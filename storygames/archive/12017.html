I'm enough of a geek that I'll enjoy just flipping through setting books. But it seems to me that it mostly fits under the heading of "lonely fun." Some people enjoy making thousands of character sheets, I enjoy pouring over esoteric lore about a fictional world.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, I, too, settled into the default position that you could introduce this material at the table only with long-winded lectures holding forth on the topic, and blamed the other players for their natural reaction of eyes glazing over, heads drooping, and eventually, nobody paying much attention. Now, I've seen ways that some games have handled this <em>well</em>, and it has made me interested in what other techniques might exist.<br/><br/>To kick things off and illustrate what I mean, here are some of the techniques that have inspired me:\n<ul>\n<li>Minutiae in <em>Shock:</em>. We have little tidbits of setting scattered out on the table, which anyone can contribute towards. The audience can use minutiae to influence conflict, so we have a reason to reincorporate these facts in the story.</li>\n<li>Setting Aspects in FATE. The FATE fractal means we can define any part of the setting with Aspects, just like a character. And characters can use those Aspects in play. Even better, there are rules to declare and add new Aspects.</li>\n</ul>\nBoth of these work great with collaborative setting creation, but they can also help share a big, detailed setting. Joshua A.C. Newman has started doing this with Human Contact in <em>Shock:</em>. Basically, we just have a bunch of minutiae to start off with. A FATE setting can have a bunch of Aspects already in play, giving you a starting point. We can add more in play, but that doesn't mean we have to start from scratch, either.<br/><br/>What are some other ways to break up lots of detailed setting information and introduce them in play, in a way that's actually fun, instead of the old, long-winded lecture?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268864/#Comment_268864" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T13:32:44+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  1:32PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keith Senkowski has a great <a href="http://conspiracyofshadows.com/blog/life-paths" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> about how life paths are really great ways of teaching the players about the setting without having to give the long-winded-speech.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268879/#Comment_268879" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T15:55:53+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  3:55PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ages ago I ran a big blood-and-thunder fantasy game.

So I set up an email list with all the players on it, and every day on my lunch break I'd send out something about the world.  It was fragmentary and impressionistic, and was meant more as a creative exercise -- I recall writing epic poetry "badly translated from the Orcish," for instance -- but the players either loved it or ignored it, and it really contributed to how well that game ran.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268932/#Comment_268932" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T05:27:43+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  5:27AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love reading deep background for a game.

Part of the reason the games were so fun and lush was the giant amount of setting to play around in. Everyone playing had differing levels of familiarity with the setting itself, but the game worked well.<br/><br/>I think the reason a detailed setting worked for our group-of-the-time was that everyone had mind-numbingly boring day jobs.<br/><br/>Now, I was working from home, but everyone else in my group was a computer programmer in the air force. These people would have email conversations 30-40 messages deep about where to go for lunch out of sheer boredom. (This was before Gmail and nested replies! My inbox was a mess!)

And yes, when you put it like that, I can see that I do have a different goal. I don't want the players to absorb a large number of facts <em>before</em> play, necessarily; I'd rather they absorb a large number of facts <em>in</em> play. And if they should feel motivated to do a bunch of reading beforehand, I'd like that to payoff in play, too, but not so much that it becomes a requirement.<br/><br/>I've got a group more like the one Elizabeth has now\u2014everybody works, and nobody has a particularly large amount of free time to devote to things like reading a thick setting book. I still love rich, detailed settings, though, so I want to have ways of breaking up those facts, so that we can absorb them in play. That way, we can have big, detailed settings, but if you don't have time to read a big setting book, you've still got enough that you're not missing out.<br/><br/>As I said at the top of the thread, Minutiae and Aspects seem like great ways of achieving this. They both give enough mechanical teeth so that a player is motivated to find ways to engage the setting, and they both break those facts up into digestible, evocative bits.<br/><br/>To illustrate, I ran a game set in the Forgotten Realms with this group. They'd all gamed enough that they'd played Forgotten Realms games before, and while I don't believe that the setting <em>makes</em> GM's run it badly, it certainly does nothing to discourage it. The walls of novels lure GM's into the trap of making their favorite character the star, while the PC's get to sit back and watch someone else save the day. Having been burned in the past, they were up in arms the first time the word "Harpers" crossed my lips, and I feared violence to my person should I utter "Elminster." They'd had GM's before who used the big, detailed setting as a club with which to beat them over the head, so they weren't really willing to even give me the chance to make my own mistakes. I was judged by the mistakes of others, and so never got the chance to do anything differently.<br/><br/>I'm running a historical game now, set in post-Roman Britain. In a former life, I obsessed over this period. But I don't want this to become Jasons' lecture time; I want to give them enough of the setting that they can play with it and enjoy it, but I don't want to beat them over the head with it. I want them to be able to learn the setting during play, and I want that to be something fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269158/#Comment_269158" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T11:04:10+00:00" title="April 27, 2010 11:04AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>I've got a group more like the one Elizabeth has now\u2014everybody works, and nobody has a particularly large amount of free time to devote to things like reading a thick setting book.

You said you want them to "be able to learn the setting during play", but what I'm trying to get at is, what's the purpose of learning the setting? Do you want to teach them about this cool setting that you love, i.e. the purpose of the game is to teach? Do you want the setting to play some role in the story?  Is the setting the source of challenges or conflicts?  <br/><br/>Basically you have to answer these questions in order that you break down the setting into various divisions:<br/><br/>1 - Stuff they absolutely must know in order to play the game.  There are no cellphones in post-Roman Britain.  Women are treated a particular way in Iroquois culture.  Whatever.  This is the "reading list" you want to minimize.  The fact that you want to minimize it should be a clue as to what relationship the setting should have to the game.  <br/><br/>2 - Stuff they probably should know at some point in order to play the game, and which they should keep in mind over a long period of time.  People in small-town America often own hunting rifles and shotguns even if they're not "avid" hunters.  Whatever.  These are things that go onto a cheat sheet or other reference.<br/><br/>3 - Stuff they might need to know in a particular situation but that they don't need to remember - either it's such a brief factoid that there's no burden in just re-explaining it each time it comes up, or it's not likely to recur.  James H. Duff was Governor of Pennsylvania in 1950.  This is something you explain "in the moment".  By making a list of these things, you minimize the need to lecture.<br/><br/>4 - Stuff about the setting they don't need to know unless they ask.  Mulla Khan was one of the most prominent singers in Baluchistan.  You normally don't need to make a list of these, but you should note when players ask, because they may be signaling their interest in other, related areas of the setting.<br/><br/>5 - Stuff about the setting they don't need to know unless they really charge after it with a shovel.  Ashkisy is in the Omsk Time Zone.  You probably don't even need to know this stuff yourself.<br/><br/>I kinda think that people who say "I want the players to learn all about this setting but I don't want them to do any boring old reading..." often kinda do want the players to do the boring old reading, but they don't think it's realistic.  If getting a setting "right" is important to the atmosphere of your story, there really aren't any shortcuts. You can count on them getting it wrong if you play before they learn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269200/#Comment_269200" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T13:56:13+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  1:56PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the upcoming Vienna-in-1800-ish operapunk game I'm starting (we're in chargen now), I tried one-page "Loresheets" that highlight setting elements the players should know for grounding their characters.  That's proved pretty successful for laying out telling details like "Most city streets are dirt roads" or "buildings that abut cemetaries have no windows so people won't dump their chamber pots on consecrated ground."  I've done some in bullet-point fashion, others in short essay.  Only five Loresheets so far, more if the players want them.  And as far as I'm concerned, the players have the green light to expand things by contributing their own Loresheets.

Or in other words, if a player says something completely wrong about the setting, 1, how much does it bother you, 2, who decides that it's wrong?<br/><br/>If Aspects are close to what you want, I submit that a player getting the setting "right" is actually a fairly low bar for you. You are willing to give up your vision of the setting and go with what another player at the table creates.  You aren't attached to your version of the setting as much as you think you are.  This means you actually have to teach very little - the "dealbreakers", as it were.  (Of course collaboration is not guaranteed to give you, or any of your collaborators, a satisfying result, but it can, and it's easy.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269243/#Comment_269243" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T20:12:02+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  8:12PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2010 8:12PM by jason.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because I've seen contradictions from other people at the table really break down the contributions you get from others, I try not to say anything, but the truth of the matter is, it often does bother me when someone throws out a wrong detail.

When you say "fidelity to a setting", what you mean from a story gaming point of view is consistency with an established vision.  It might be your vision, or the vision of another creator (here I am thinking of Tolkein's histories, or Turtledove's), but somehow in order to get that fidelity, you have to get them to see the elements of the vision that you want to be established. You can't telepathically get them to do the right thing - you have to communicate it somehow. Visually, textually, audibly, through tactile means (food? perfume?)  At any rate there just aren't any shortcuts for that. If you have a great deal of detail without which you are dissatisfied with play, in order to get satisfied you have to get that great deal of detail across somehow, and it has to be outside of the play you want to be satisfied with.  I say embrace it. Some of the best historical RPG experiences I've had have been with history aficionados.  It's an incredibly rich experience when more than one person at the table has access to a large volume of knowledge about the setting. But they had to read a book first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269256/#Comment_269256" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-28T02:51:35+00:00" title="April 28, 2010  2:51AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless you have players who are self-motivated to learn the history of the Middle-Realms (see what I did there...Middle-earth...Forgotten Realms) there is really only one thing to do:<br/><br/>The details of the world have to matter to the player and the best way to do that is to connect the character to those details.

I'm interested in what some of the other means might be. Reading assignments and lectures I'm familiar with, and not entirely satisfied with. I'm interested in what other techniques we might be able to use at the table to communicate that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Both minutiae and aspects are created collaboratively and through play, I don't see how they relate to playing a highly detailed published setting.</blockquote>\nHave you seen <em>Human Contact</em>? I wouldn't compare it in volume to Forgotten Realms (at least, not yet!), but you've got two small books full of setting details now. It basically works like Minutiae already on the table when play starts. In our last <em>Chronica Feudalis</em> campaign, I did the same with some Aspects that consolidated some of the highlights of the setting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Or, you make characters who don't know anything about the world and allow the players to discover all of these details and historical tidbits that you so love at the same time that their characters do.</blockquote>\nI'm doing this with a <em>Werewolf: The Forsaken</em> game I'm running right now. It doesn't have as much detail as some settings, but enough that we might run into trouble. Basically, I broke the major setting themes into major topics, and then planned a chapter around each one. So far, it's worked out pretty well.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>What else?</blockquote>\nThat's what I'm interested in! So far, my favorites include:\n<ol><li>Having a bunch of Minutiae or Aspects to start off with.</li><li>Random encounter tables</li><li>Stuff like "Lore Sheets" from <em>Weapons of the Gods</em></li><li>Lifepaths</li></ol>\nI got the idea for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> from <em>Human Contact</em>, and it's given me a good start in my <em>Chronica Feudalis</em> campaign. It works well for my post-Roman Britain setting, because there's not a whole lot of history that we know for sure. So, I want to make sure I establish those things that we <em>do</em> know for sure, but I'm not too worried about other players adding new things, since, once I've set up what we <em>do</em> know, there's so much that we <em>don't</em> know about the period that it's very unlikely that they'll suggest something that's just flat-out impossible.<br/><br/>I got <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232-5&amp;Mode=like">#2-5</a> from <a href="http://princeofcairo.livejournal.com/152308.html" rel="nofollow">the aforementioned LJ that Ken Hite posted</a>.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>How about just telling them as it becomes relevant and their character could reasonably be expected to know?</blockquote>\nYou certainly can do that, but it kills some great opportunities. A few years back, I tried to run a <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> game. It didn't go too well. I tried to come up with this one-sheet of basic Japanese etiquette. After all, a lot of the game here lies in the veiled subtleties, and you can't be very subtle unless you know the rules. I wanted stuff like putting your sword on the wrong side when you sit down to signal that you didn't trust the guy, rather than just the player forgetting that detail, or using "-san" to insult someone, not just because you forgot that you were supposed to call him "-sama."<br/><br/>Now, yes, I could have just introduced those details as they came up. That would have avoided the general discontent that brought the game down (my brother still sometimes refers to that campaign by saying, "Oh yeah, the one where you gave us all that homework?"), but it would have meant that all the subtle interactions came from NPC's doing subtle things towards the PC's. It would never be something that the PC's could do. That seems like a missed opportunity to me.<br/><br/>Also, what Nathan said.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Man, starting from scratch is my bread and buttah but I'm not going there because it doesn't feel like it is what Jason is getting at.

I'm just wondering if that love has exiled me from the established setting I loved in a previous life forever, or if some clever techniques might help to draw players into a big, detailed setting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Jason, this is your thread and I am wondering where you want this to go?</blockquote>\nI'm interested in the techniques people use at the table to communicate a big, detailed setting in a way that's fun.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Could you (or anyone) name an instance of play where a big setting was on the table and it was a fun experience?  What made that setting text fun for you all?</blockquote>\nI think it remains more theoretical for me than real. Story games were once pretty theoretical for me, too, so that doesn't scare me off too much. But in my own experience, the big, detailed setting has mostly been "lonely fun" for me as the GM in between sessions. Players have typically not cared much. My last D&amp;D campaign was ostensibly set in the Forgotten Realms, but "Realmslore" came up so infrequently that it really could have happened anywhere. The players didn't know the setting and had little interest in learning it, and while we did have fun, the story felt like it took place in a void at times. It had little connection to history or traditions beyond what the PC's did, and I think this had a lot to do with the PC's knowledge of the setting. They didn't know it, so they couldn't use it to their advantage. I agree very much with what you said, making it relevant to a character seems pretty key to getting them interested. I'm planning a new D&amp;D campaign where one of them plays a swordmage of Myth Drannor. Now, suddenly, he's asking me for links to read up on the history of Myth Drannor! So I suppose you could really look at it as what kind of techniques can help make setting bits relevant to a character. Minutiae and Aspects make them relevant to a character, because those bits turn setting facts into resources that players can use. The things Ken Hite wrote about\u2014lifepaths, random encounter tables, and "Lore Sheets"\u2014do much the same thing. So what else is out there? What other techniques do we have to (1) break up a big, detailed setting into digestible bits, and (2) turn those bits into things relevant to characters and fun for players?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>It's not always the GM.

And while no one cared much about Forgotten Realms, we do have a big Eberron fanboy. While I'm sure some tables would have found the corrections fun and engaging, I just found the constant shut-down and negation stifling and aggravating, every bit as much as if it had come from the GM. Obviously, this relates a lot to how you play, what you expect out of play, and all that. I love affirmative, collaborative play, that "Yes, and" kind of play. Negation is incredibly toxic to that. But I'm also a huge nerd, so I appreciate a lot of detail and getting a setting "right." Not too long ago, I would've just accepted that those two things were mutually exclusive and simply dealt with it. But indie/story games have taught me that a lot of the things I once gave up on as impossible aren't nearly so impossible, so now you've got me thinking about the ways that we can have a collaborative play experience and still stay true to a big, detailed setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269438/#Comment_269438" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T08:21:00+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  8:21AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'm saying that it comes down to creative agenda.

Like lines versus points.  For example, in a medieval Europe game, I provided the following "lines" to the players, bits geared entirely at establishing setting flavor in a way that could inspire the players to extrapolate their own details.  I introduced more subtle details and political "points" during play as needed, tying them to cues that asked for a player response:  "The bishop enters, and everyone around you drops to one knee and bows their heads.  Some people fold their hands in prayer.  What do you do?"<br/><br/>The Lines:<br/><br/>- The only illumination at night is firelight or moonlight.  Period.  Night is DARK.  If you don't have candles, torches, lanterns, or enough moon in the sky, it's pitch-black.<br/><br/>- Unless it's a Roman road, roads are dirt.  Dusty in the summer, muddy in winter, often with deep ruts.  City streets are pretty much the same, except with more chamber pot filth.<br/><br/>- Your birth nails your social status, which is viewed almost like belonging to different species.  In general, the filthier and more poorly dressed you are, the lower your station, and vice versa.  Almost nobody can rise above their station.  Lots of stereotyping is based on class, so go wild doing it.<br/><br/>- Nobles and those of rank can get away with a lot.  Because they're better than you.  Or just because.<br/><br/>- People drink a lot of beer, because beer (and wine) is safer to drink than water.<br/><br/>- Horse crap everywhere.  Lots of animals live in very close proximity to people.<br/><br/>- Coin is for merchants and nobles.  Got a chicken?  Barter for those new shoes.<br/><br/>...and etc.  The point was to give the players a few telling details that worked as principles to extrapolate the rest of the world.  If you're willing to cue them when the subtle points come up, playing with a little bit at a time, and even reinforcing your subtle thing mechanically (reverently touching the hem of that holy man's robe gives you a bonus on your next roll, maybe), I think you can get quite a bit across.  It depends on how much you're willing and able to convey in play as opposed to a priori prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269452/#Comment_269452" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T09:47:44+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  9:47AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite><br/>A few years back, I tried to run a<em>Legend of the Five Rings</em>game.

After all, a lot of the game here lies in the veiled subtleties, and you can't be very subtle unless you know the rules. I wanted stuff like putting your sword on the wrong side when you sit down to signal that you didn't trust the guy, rather than just the player forgetting that detail, or using "-san" to insult someone, not just because you forgot that you were supposed to call him "-sama."<br/></blockquote>\nI think this may go to what Adam is saying about conflicting agendas.<br/><br/>I have been in that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exact situation</span> with D&amp;D Oriental Adventures. The players who loved James Clavell's 'Shogun' as much as me were totally into all those samurai details, and the ones who weren't were frustrated because they didn't know or care about that stuff. Which, in turn, frustrated the enthusiasts because my god, your worthless ronin can't turn his back on the emperor what is WRONG with you?!?!<br/><br/>Except a sheet of details about that etiquette doesn't work so well. Like your brother said, it feels like homework. <br/><br/>What you need, I think, is to play THAT game with only the people who dig 'Shogun' (or whatever). And if your group isn't that group, then your enthusiasm for the genre or setting is probably not enough to make the game work.<br/><br/>I don't mean to sound defeatist! Learning to put down a setting or game that no one else is into is a hard lesson, and one I have not fully learned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269454/#Comment_269454" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T09:53:10+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  9:53AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2010 9:53AM by Brian_Minter.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be more positive, another vote for lifepaths being a great way to communicate important setting details.

Your list here is solid.  I'd say that Brennan T invented a new one (or at least, I haven't seen it done quite that way before) in "How We Came to Live Here". Its a dirty hippie game about collective setting-creation while at the same time exploring the Anastazi culture... without having to read volumes of it to get started.<br/><br/>Now, stop me if I'm misremembering (I looked at Jason's copy and was impressed, will eventually score my own), but you basically have what can be called "Culture Classes". It's like a character class for your character that sets them in some "cultural group" of the tribe: Hunters, gatherers, potters, weavers, stuff like that. They are socially interesting and these cultures have huge weight in the setting. Anyway, these cultural classes have levels, and to advance to the next level (1-6 or so?) your character has to do certain things or have certain experiences.<br/><br/>It is an awesome way to divide a setting into bite-sized chunks, teaching a culture (here realisic, but fantastical works just as well) in easy to swallow bits that are tied directly to the character, and doing so in a way that comes up throughout play, unlike "just at character generation" (like Lifepaths and Loresheets).<br/><br/>Keith, I think you mentioned that Lifepaths were an awesome way to present setting. Personally, I think most implementations are just as overwhelming as Loresheets in WOTG were. I like the tightness of these cultural groups from Brennan's HWCTLH, the fact that you don't sit there for hours pondering which lifepaths or loresheets to take, rather you choose one based on a summary, and in reading the class you not only know your place in the culture and the setting, you see what you can do to be a more important or renown member of that culture. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270098/#Comment_270098" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T12:16:29+00:00" title="May  5, 2010 12:16PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like sound of that.<br/><br/>I always wondered about those "class/level names" in D&amp;D, like where if you reached 8th level as a Fighter you should be referred to as a Myrmidon, and a 14th-level (or whatever) Magic-User was an Arch-Mage. <br/><br/>It makes a whole lot more sense if you say:<br/><br/>"If you want to become an Arch-Mage, you must pass the Trial of Beelzebub in front of the Council of Arch-Mages.
