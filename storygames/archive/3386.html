Even when we were running weekly 6-hour AD&amp;D2E games in high school, deaths didn't happen too often, and they were almost always more touching than funny (a credit to my longtime DM Steven Chalfant).<br/><br/>However, in the long history of my gaming, I have both seen and played some pretty amusing PCs. How about you?<br/><br/>Here's mine:<br/><br/>---===---<br/><br/>PLAYED: Hoag. AD&amp;D 2E, Homebrew game setting.<br/>I knew I was moving away in high school when we started this pretty epic campaign. So I decided that I want to be on the fast track to awesome (in other words, not a spellcaster who gets their awesome stuff later, I decided to be a twinked fighter so I can be awesome now).<br/><br/>Enter HOAG.<br/>Hoag wears all blank. Hoag is like the Punisher, if the Punisher had friends and lived in the Forgotten Realms.<br/>Hoag weilds dual short swords. He carried 8 short swords on his person at any time. He specialized in short swords.<br/>Favorite technique: Killing dudes with dual short swords, using his massive strength bonuses for murder.<br/>Other favorite technique: Throwing short swords at people like they were throwing daggers.<br/>Personality: Virtually None.<br/>Other characteristics: Not too talkative. Wears all black. Dark personality. Carries lots of short swords. Wears black.<br/><br/>---===---<br/><br/>PLAYED: Ploppy. AD&amp;D 2E: Forgotten Realms.<br/><br/>Ploppy was my first ever AD&amp;D2E character. I was absolutely serious when I made him, and roleplayed with him a lot (he wasn't a gag character). Dwarf Fighter.<br/>Unfamiliar with the fact that there wasn't really any player authoring in these kinds of games, I proposed an entire plotline where he's trying to find his clan's magical axe, called "THING AXE", which was actually a monofilament scythe with these rotating swirling spinning blades on the sides which basically turns him into a walking Meat Lawnmower.  I think that there was also some sort of magically-tracking crossbow attachment on it as well. I handed a picture of THING AXE to the DM, and suggested that it could be my campaign goal. DM: "...Hmmm.  No."<br/><br/>Ploppy died. But he came back a year later for three more adventures.<br/><br/>---===---<br/><br/>SAW: Name Forgotten (so I'll call him "Aaron", based on the player). TORG. <br/><br/>I loved reading TORG, was obsessed with it, so at some point I decided to run a session of it with some friends (I think I was 14 or 15?). And Aaron. Aaron was a long time aquaintence, and friend of my best friend. This was one of my first sessions as GM, and I had the adventure all prepared and ready to go, I just needed some friends to come over, make characters and throw down.  So IIRC, it was me, Drew, Anne, Kim, Greg and Aaron.<br/><br/>I carefully explained the world, how it's all these COSMs at war with each other, and they can choose the cosm that they come from. We had a ninja, a werewolf, a secret agent.<br/><br/>And Aaron decided that he wanted to be a living magical table that could throw exploding silverware.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Me, being a novice and confused GM, and wanting deep down not to cock block anybody, came up with this strained explanation about how he came from the magical world of Aysle, how he was transformed by magic into a table, and how some Dwarves of light crafted him some weapons to defend himself with until he could turn back.<br/><br/>Basically, the adventure went in circles, a lot of confusion, and the game ended that day. Some of it was because I bit off too much. But most of it was because I had to chase Aaron around and keep him from ruining things (for the other players) with his magical damned table and its heat seeking exploding silverware ("I attack the wall." "I attack Kim. No not her character, Kim herself. I throw silverware at the screen, and it passes through into our world, hitting Kim.", etc)<br/><br/>-Andy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76606/#Comment_76606" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T09:24:31+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  9:24AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The dumbest characters I have known, by Rich:</b><br/><br/>Pt 1, 1988 - 1996<br/><br/><b>1990 : </b> When I was about 16 I ran a Shadowrun game for some buddies and my younger brother played a merc called Rodney Cox, AKA "Throbin' Rod".  His war cry was "Bolllllaaarrrks!"  He had a minigun and shot lots of gangers.  Which was mostly the point.<br/><br/><b>1988 : </b>A couple of years before that, I was involved in a game of TMNT at Dartford Games Club.  A guy called Dan was running the game.  Dan was, to be frank, not popular or smart.  The only reason he was running the game was because nobody else had anything prepped for that night and the regular GM for our Star Wars game was sick or on holiday or something.<br/><br/>So Dan pulls out TMNT and we all start statting up our characters and one of the options is all being the same type of animal.  So we decided to do that.  One of the other players, Stuckey, I think, asks if we can be lemmings.  Dan says they're not in the book, but the book says to make up new animals and gives guidelines basing them off other animals.  He's not quite sure what a lemming is, and Stuckey explains that they are like Rats, but bigger.  So we spend about an hour statting up these kung-fu lemmings.<br/><br/>And, of course, the first thing we do when the game starts is throw ourselves off the observation deck of the tallest building in the city.<br/><br/>The next week Neil was back and we carried on playing Star Wars.<br/><br/><b>1987 - 1993 : </b>Every game anyone ran for my friend Matt, he played a character called Joe Loss, or some variation of that.<br/>Joe Loss was a Combat Mage in Shadowrun<br/>Joe Loss was a wealthy playboy in Call Of Cthulu<br/>Joe-R-LOS was an Alpha Complex trouble shooter<br/>Joe Loss was the daytime alter ego of Scumslayer, his Champions character<br/>J03-L05 was an Astromech droid<br/>Joe Loss was a Ventrue<br/>Joe Loss was a couple of dozen different characters in several different campaigns over the time I knew Matt.  Thing is, they were mostly very different and well played characters.<br/><br/>Except Scumslayer, that guy was a right twat.<br/><br/><b>1996 : </b>So it's the nineties and I'm running Vampire, as was pretty much everyone at this point.  I'm at university and run games mostly at the gaming club there.  A guy called Alistair (who usually plays Battletech) wants to join in.  I'm always happy to have more people in the game, but I regret this one pretty quickly.  He creates a character who's essentially The Punisher, is a Nosferatu (because apparently their clan disadvantage "isn't really a disadvantage at all") and put "Vigilante" for both his nature and demeanour.<br/><br/>Not really a good fit with the rest of the party, and the last time I ever let people create characters <b>without making them talk to the rest of the people at the table for approval first.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76607/#Comment_76607" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T09:29:05+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  9:29AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played a Malkavian who believed that he was the Messiah, and that rock &amp; roll can save your soul. He ended up as the prince of the city because everyone else was dead, and he "only" got buried under a collapsed building.<br/><br/>I have toned down that same character and turned him into a Toreador for a LARP.<br/><br/>I have played Exalted with what started off as Jackie Chan and turned into a cross between Jackie Chan and Goku - because really, with an Essence 6 Solar martial artist, you almost have to be part Goku. We all got cutscenes at the end of the game, and mine was me and the Eclipse walking around Yu-shan with a big list of all the gods of slavery and beating their heads in, Jay-and-Silent-Bob style.<br/><br/>I have played John Bear, a hillbilly Ranger/Fighter with a Vow of Poverty in a post-apocalyptic D&amp;D game set in the northeastern US. He was one of my favorites.<br/><br/>I have <i>always wanted to play</i> an evil necromancer who's only helping the party because they're killing off his rivals. The idea of having "Knowledge: all the boss monsters" is highly amusing to me.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'm missing a few. I should note that the Solar and the Fighter/Ranger made perfect sense in the games they were in, but were also meant to be a little amusing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76609/#Comment_76609" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T09:38:05+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  9:38AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I forgot:<br/><br/><b>1997 ish :</b> I played in a Vampire Larp.

He was a computer hacker and used to spend most of his time locked away anyway.<br/><br/>He ended up representing the Nosferatu on the city council at one point.

Like the time he talked the party into traveling with him to the Swamp of Old Guys (The Mere of Dead Men) because there was just treasure laying around.  There was indeed treasure... and lizardmen, and ghosts, and zombies, and various other nasties.  Or the time he blew his entire reward for an adventure on several books on how to train platypus because he was certain that the platypus was the new up and coming pet for the idle rich.  This worked because the trend caught on with the halflings and gnomes in the Waterdeep area.<br/><br/>Thistle's identifying quote was, "Hi!  I'm Thistle Thornapple, a mighty warrior.  I killed a dragon once."  He had a donkey he called Mother.  He claimed it was his actual mother who had been polymorphed by an evil wizard and he hadn't been able to find anyone to reverse the spell yet.  He still made Mother carry all the supplies.  Thistle resolutely denied being a thief or a rogue and refused to use his illicit skills anywhere someone could see him.<br/><br/>There are many stories about Thistle that I could tell but they're better in person than simply written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76612/#Comment_76612" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T09:47:37+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  9:47AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On an online game, my friend and I played two Malkavians.

The only reason he was running the game was because nobody else had anything prepped for that night and the regular GM for our Star Wars game was sick or on holiday or something.<br/><br/>So Dan pulls out TMNT and we all start statting up our characters and one of the options is all being the same type of animal.  So we decided to do that.  One of the other players, Stuckey, I think, asks if we can be lemmings.  Dan says they're not in the book, but the book says to make up new animals and gives guidelines basing them off other animals.  He's not quite sure what a lemming is, and Stuckey explains that they are like Rats, but bigger.  So we spend about an hour statting up these kung-fu lemmings.<br/><br/>And, of course, the first thing we do when the game starts is throw ourselves off the observation deck of the tallest building in the city.<br/><br/>The next week Neil was back and we carried on playing Star Wars.</blockquote>\nYou win the thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104569/#Comment_104569" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T08:30:02+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  8:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did name a character Don Hastily one time.

Do I hit?<br/>ME: No.<br/><br/>The player eventually gave up after he was arrested for failing to mug a shopkeeper and then failed to mug the guard trying to arrest him.<br/><br/><br/>One of my favorites:<br/>Honesty, AD&amp;D2e RPGA. 1st level Human Bard.  A compulsive liar.  Repeatedly insisted that he was an 8th level fighter.  He was killed by another PC, a 20th level wild mage, at an event.

They were both as near death as you could get, wounded, beat up, and bleeding, and crawled into an alley a safe distance away, congratulating each other on an amazing victory.<br/><br/>However, they had a medical kit. So, one says to the other, "here, let me heal you, and then you can heal me." Unfortunately, neither had any good technical/medical skills. The first mighty warrior prodded the other, injected him with some random needles, and... no effect. The second warrior was annoyed, snatched the medical pack away from him and did the same. After a few more pathetic rolls, the two warriors failed badly enough to deal a point of damage (I think that happened on a critical miss in that system) to each other, and lay down together for the long, final sleep...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
