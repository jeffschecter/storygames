The projections/estimates were pretty much incorrect, all the time. It had a nice "countdown" feature though with a minute timer that was more specific than KS, so that was helpful in the end. But ultimately pretty, but not helpful.<br/><br/>What really needs to be done is a true end-to-end tracking system: Polling users say one year after the campaign ends, to see if the creator fulfilled their obligatios/backing (or if it's still in progress), gauge satisfaction, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392207/#Comment_392207" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T08:19:39+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  8:19AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2012 8:27AM by TylerT.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The kickstarter back end shows you how much money and how many bakers each source of visitors provided. so if i have a post here on story games it will tell me how much money people following the link here have given to the project. this helps identify what sources are viable methods of promotion.<br/><br/>What a project creator can learn from kicktraq is that the "average" kickstarter has an active period at the start and at the end. problem is there is no average successful kickstarter, the average kickstarter is a failure and most successes are distinct in many ways. <br/><br/>kicktraq is however a bunch of fun for people who have backed your project already. I watched the reaper and relic knights kicktraqs closely. The strange thing is i actually saw backers of the Relic Knights kick starter develop the same sort of "one week angst" i know some project creators suffer from (myself included). It's this period after the initial rush of funding (usually about a week) where you stop getting new backers and suddenly you start to wonder if anyone is going to back your project again!  normally Backers are immune to this because they do not pay such close attention to how fast the amount is going up.<br/><br/>I actually want to use the source of backers data to influence a project. like if your website draws this amount of funding then everyone gets a game card designed based on that website. A "Source Goal" to go along with the popular "Stretch Goal"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392236/#Comment_392236" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T10:48:48+00:00" title="October  3, 2012 10:48AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>The kickstarter back end shows you how much money and how many bakers each source of visitors provided. so if i have a post here on story games it will tell me how much money people following the link here have given to the project. this helps identify what sources are viable methods of promotion.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>Just note, that these stats are not always right. I had a few backers come in at very specific levels, and I know exactly which sites they came/were informed from. But KS's backer source stats showed all those levels in a cloud which basically amounted to, "They found your project from within Kickstarter.com itself! Go us!" :-)<br/><br/>However, some accounting errors like the above aside, it is a really cool feature. Sometimes some sites popped up that I never heard of before, and I was able to go out and thank those backers directly, or answer some questions. It is a pretty damn awesome tool, again minor accounting issues aside.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kicktraq" title="kicktraq"><img alt="kicktraq" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/283/nGS40VNQGO6QV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kicktraq">kicktraq</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392716/#Comment_392716" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T10:22:19+00:00" title="October  8, 2012 10:22AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy &gt; I'm sorry Kicktraq wasn't a helpful tool for you.
