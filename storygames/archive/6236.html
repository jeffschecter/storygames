Van Dread is a horror/pulpy game set in the modern age. Characters play former insane asylum inmates that are set free to fight supernatural threats under the guidance of a mysterious organization.<br/>My initial concept for the monsters they fight and the usual story format didn't work for me(Silent Hill-esque monsters, game limited to ghosts) so I'm in need of new antagonists.<br/>I know the game is pulpy and focus a lot on action, with little investigation and horror thrown in, so this is what's important to me:<br/><br/>1. Antagonists should often be multiple, or at least have many goons and pawns. A vampire for example should have lots of vampire underlings, to provide cannon fodder until the big climax.<br/>2. The Big Bad guy should have one or more weaknesses that provide a means to even the odds. They shouldn't be too crippling though.<br/>3. Monsters should be original, or at least a reincorporation of traditional monsters. For example, a Vampire that looks like a human beeing but can grow tentacles and spit acid. That's not a very original example, granted, but I'm taking the easy road.<br/><br/>On to the main issue. My problem is, do I create an original setting and offer a ''monster manual'' of sorts(ala CoC, DG, etc) or do I go the other way and provide the means for a GM or the players to create a completely original monster? Maybe a mix of the two?<br/>Here's what I have:<br/>Classify monsters according to their archetypes: Vampires (feed on humans to survive, parasites), beasts (hunt humans to survice, werewolves and their ilk), elder gods (cthulhu-like entities, etc), cults and the many(zombies, alien invasion type things, etc)<br/>and then provide some well thought out examples as a sample setting. Also, provide rules to create your own monsters, with a point buy system like ORE or even The Guide to the Fomori book by WW. It would work like this:<br/><br/>I want a game with parasites that take over the host and make them into monsters. I want the parasite to be intelligent and feed on humans, so I go with the Vampire archetype, since The Many are mostly about taking over the world or completely mindless.<br/>The vampire needs an origin(means of infection). I come up with a story about intelligent fleas that have a taste for blood. The Big Bad is the original vampire. He is stronger, bigger, more freakish and has weird powers.<br/>I need a purpose for him so I come up with him wanting to take over a small town and later on expand. He uses his minions and more fleas to take over the inhabitants ala Invasion of the Body Snatchers. He butchers a few of them too.<br/>But what kind of powers does this monster and his minions have? I have 10 points to use. I look at the pages for the monster abilities and choose:<br/><br/>Tentacles at 2 points. They reach 4 feet and sprout from my back. They function like extra limbs and they can hit or grab.<br/>Spit Acid at 3 points. It causes x amount of damage. It looks like black paint and causes horrible burns.<br/>Superhuman Strength at 3 points. Adds 3 strength points to the vampire, staying true to vampire mythology.<br/>Escape measure for 2 points. He can abandon the host at will. Useful for sequels.<br/><br/>I like this but I dont know if this would work, especially coming up with your own origin and purpose as well as weakness. Maybe a Burning Empires-style mechanic is needed. But then again I want to keep this simple.<br/><br/>Opinions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138336/#Comment_138336" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T13:55:45+00:00" title="April  5, 2008  1:55PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you provide the tools and examples, people who play your game will come up with stuff ten times more awesome than you can.

Essentialy, each archetype will get 3-4 examples that are sufficiently fleshed out and each element will get a few keyword examples(Origin: transylvania legend vampire, alien tapeworm, lab virus).

My suggestion would be to include these three elements to whatever degree you want:<br/><br/>1.) Some excuse/reason for monsters. They are alien demon ghosts from dimension Z. But they are all unique. Bingo! So players know why they have to get rid of them, but the GM (or whoever) has massive leeway when constructing new monsters. But maybe a bit more than just: "Monsters are, y'know, monsters. They do monster-y things." That's too vague.<br/><br/>2.) Instructions for making monsters. You don't need a full point-buy system either, you can go with a questionaire format - see the monster section in Vincent Baker's Afraid, where he outlines how to write the monster, or the Adventure Burner in Burning Wheel's Blossoms are Falling supplement. Or the questions in their Monster Burner. As long as there is a guide. I mean, not everybody is going to care how many points the monster is worth. They might even make it up on the fly - which is easier with a questionaire.<br/><br/>3.) You MUST have examples. This is not optional - if you don't have examples your game is teh fail and you suck. Obviously. But I would suggest using example monsters that really highlight certain aspects of the game, like certain rules or the kind of atmosphere you want to portray, or some way of turning a common trope on its head.<br/><br/>But don't just put some Archetypes in it - everybody knows what vampires and werewolves are about, it doesn't need repeating. You want lists based around certain behavioral categories - how does the monster feed, why does it make people suffer, what is its weakness, how does it travel, who are its minions, etc.<br/><br/>You want "archetypes" based on behavior - the Parasite (physical invasion), the Conspiracy (mook army, social invasion), the Path of Destruction (hard to find, heroes always get to the scene too late, need to guess its next appearance), etc etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138412/#Comment_138412" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T11:40:51+00:00" title="April  6, 2008 11:40AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is more or less what I was thinking too. I didn't know that Burning Wheel has a monster burner, I must check it out. I've only seen the world burner from BE in action on SG chat and I liked that. Hopefuly I can make something equally good.<br/>The reason for what the monster is doing is usually a mix of the monster's archetype and the purpose the GM comes up with(Vampire: need to feed + ultimate goal of making vampires the dominant breed on earth).<br/>On <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, this was what I was thinking too. I want to make a weird/pulpy kind of game so I'm looking at lots of tentacles and weird/gross monsters as well as some huge ones and invasion of the body snatchers type deal.<br/><br/>The archetypes are essentially the core of monsters. A vampire is a like a parasite that needs to feed of a host. A werewolf is a beast, it hunts for food. An old god is a powerful ancient beeing that either wants to destroy or enslave humanity. The many is either a mindless mass of monsters or a hivemind(this covers zombies, virus infections and Invasion of the body snatchers).<br/>It could be interesting to have archetypes based on genre or game style ala Geiger Counter(which is almost the same as what you said).

What does the monster need? Your archetypes here are probably: Sustenance, Domination, and Nothing.<br/><br/>Sustenance: Does it feed off blood? Pineal glands? Does it just eat people? Virgins? Babies? Souls?<br/>Examples: The blood-sucking vampire, the man-eating tiger, the devil with a contract for you to sign (he wants your soul).<br/><br/>Domination: This monster must conquer and control people. But who? Just the poor indian tribe? One valley? The US Government, and then the US people? Lawyers?<br/>Examples:The body-snatchers, European colonialists, American plantation owners, the devil who wants you to perform a task for him.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's The Thing sorta brings up a fourth category: Multiplication. This monster wants to spread. Although, all it does is kill people and mimic them, so that's like Sustenance in that once it "controls" you, you are dead and can't come back.<br/><br/>Nothing: This monster may not even know humans exist, but it is traveling through the same space as people are, and its very existence is dangerous to mind and body.<br/><br/>And then you continue on with more questions, like<br/>- How does it operate? When does it operate?<br/>- Does it have a mind? Can it think? Or does it operate on other principles?<br/>- Does it have a physical body? More than one? Is it an invisible force, like a spirit or a disease?<br/>- Does it have any weaknesses? What are they?<br/>- Does it have any enemies? Who or what?<br/>- Is it limited to a specific geographical area, or does it seek to spread?<br/>- Is it limited to a specific non-geogaphic area? Like dreams, or psychiatrists, or pretty young blondes? If so, does it seek to spread? What would the consequences of that be?<br/><br/>The werewolf, vampire and old god are just combinations of answers. The old god and the Body Snatchers are both versions of the Dominator, but have radically different methods. You need those kind of characters for your examples, but when you want players to think about creating their own, you want to break the monsters down into their component parts, their forms and methods, so they have more tools to build cool and original monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138427/#Comment_138427" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T15:39:01+00:00" title="April  6, 2008  3:39PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2008 3:39PM by George_Cotronis.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I see. The archetype you suggest sound interesting. The only problem I see is that I want to offer a system that makes monsters in a particular genre, that is, horror pulp. This is why my original archetypes were those, easily recognizable and definitely pulpy. <br/><br/>So for example, the questions in my version were like this:<br/>- Choose archetype: Parasite, Dead God, The Many, Beast<br/>- What does it want? Long term and short term goals? (Dead God wants to enter our dimension. Short term: completely take over small town by ways of cult, create mixed breed of minions)<br/>- How does it achieve it's goals? More specificaly, what pawns or minions does it use, what other powers does it have(an old god has cultists and mini squids, the power to send nightmares and manipulate minds)?<br/>- What weakness does it have?<br/><br/>Aside from that, I'm considering a ''Threat Level'' that helps with the creation. Like this:<br/>Threat level 1: Pawn level antagonists, some minions, contained and secret(Cultists, some monsters, small town or village, no media coverage).<br/>Threat level 2: Pawns and Minions, one Sergeant, semi-contained and secret(Cultists, monsters and a Big Bad, town or small city, no media coverage)<br/>etc, up to level 4 or 5 where we have an apocalypse type scenario(total zombie domination, Cthulhu rising).<br/><br/>Which is admitedly what you're saying here. I think I'm disagreeing with the archetypes. In my case it's ''type'' of monster or genre, in your case the archetype <b>is</b> the goal/need of the monster.<br/><br/>I must read up on Afraid and BE for some inspiration, but this is great help man!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138442/#Comment_138442" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T18:57:57+00:00" title="April  6, 2008  6:57PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your "Archetype" is my "Example" - that's where the confusion is.<br/><br/>I was thinking somebody would have a vague idea of the monster they want in their head, and it would solidify by them going through the list of questions and picking answers. I was actually thinking there would be a list of "archetypes" (or just answers) for each of the questions I listed. Then by answering all those questions, your monster is fleshed out and ready <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">to fuck up the PCs</span> for play. And then the Examples (wolfman, elder god, zombie plague) are some versions of you, the designer, answering those questions.<br/><br/>A really important thing you want to also do - sit down with friends and have them create a monster by asking them these questions. Then see which ones light their eyes up and which ones people kinda ho-hum over. You need the basics covered, but definitely see how people react to the list and tailor it accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138661/#Comment_138661" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T06:30:37+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  6:30AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with having to have some monsters in the core book. Not a supplement, but something in there, for use as guidelines if nothing else.<br/>\nIf you do not want to do a questionnaire format as suggested above perhaps a simple / streamlined character creation like set of guidelines.<br/>\nTreat the monsters similar to characters, of course they are not the same, but think of it in those terms.<br/>\nThen lay out a short and sweet Monster Creation set of guidelines perhaps with that questionnaire like format, simplest format is <br/>\nWho<br/>\nWhat<br/>\nWhere<br/>\nWhen<br/>\nWhy<br/>\nHow<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that Who is background, cause, effect, history, evolution, setting of the monster<br/>\nWhat is the more crunchy How it Kills, Eats, Drives insane, infects, motivates, movement, etc<br/>\nWhere is location, habitat, range in miles on a full stomach, etc.<br/>\nWhen is how will you use it in the game, main creature, mook like, is it nocturnal, etc<br/>\nWhy relates to the Who, as well as Why is it showing up anyways, cannon fodder, show off new gun pr0n, mastermind villain, etc.<br/>\nHow is like the wrap up, how will I as the GM going to use, introduce, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes lots of overlap, but this is a rough draft idea.<br/>\nTad                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
