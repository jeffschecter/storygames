Unsure how.<br/><br/>Character creation! This is the part I have sweet ideas about.<br/>It's basically based on ambilineal kinship, as I understand it.<br/><br/>There are a set number (4? 5?) of family trees that you can choose from.<br/>Each family tree is basically a lifepath flowchart.<br/>For each of three generations (your mother and father's generation, their parents generation, their parents generation), you choose one of the parents, and gain traits from them, and then continue on to their parents and choose again.<br/>So, you might choose traits from your mother, her father, and his father. Or from your father, his father, and his mother.<br/><br/>Advancing might mean choosing additional traits from those "key ancestors". I'd imagine it basically like: you have made your grandfather proud. Choose another of his traits, and add it to your character. So, your ancestors could work as Keys as well as Lifepaths, kinda.<br/><br/><b>NOW YOUR TURN:</b><br/>1.) What is gameplay about?<br/>2.) What threats are looming over the village?<br/>3.)

Ancestors, yes, but not in the sense of genealogy exactly. Tim Ingold has a really great essay on this in <em>Perception of the Environment</em>. The ancestors are important because creation is an ongoing process, and the ancestors created the world in which you live now. Which, I think answers <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. The characters are on their way to becoming ancestors for others, by participating in that daily work of creating the world. How do you create the world?

Yeah, I've been working on this game in my head for a while, too. But I will be very happy if Joe writes it, so I don't have to.<br/><br/>1) I see the game having two phases: village building and the confrontation. <br/><br/>In the village building phase, gameplay is about building connections to people. On a meta level, this makes the players care about what happens to the village. On a game play level, this is the mechanism by which players earn valuable game currency that help with the later threats. <br/><br/>In the confrontation phase, gameplay is about protecting the village and determining what and who is worth saving. It's about loss and the heroism of ordinary people.<br/><br/>2) I say let the players determine what the threats are. They'll hate the enemy even more that way. This can be a pre-play thing, or the threat can be fleshed out during play. Perhaps at the end of every scene, the spotlight player adds a new attribute to the threat. When the threat has accumulated N attributes, that triggers the confrontation.<br/><br/>3) I see gameplay as being told as a tavern story, years after the fact. "Mommy, tell me the story about how you saved the village?" To steal an idea from Epidiah (and probably from Baron Munchausen, though I have never read or played it), players can challenge one another to set up scenes: "Yeah, Jeron, remember the old blacksmith?" and then Jeron's player has to play out a scene about him as a young person and the town's blacksmith. Maybe the blacksmith was a mentor, or a thorn in his side, who knows? I don't know that PCs really need to interact much during village building, though there's no reason they can't. During the confrontation, they probably work together to save the village.<br/><br/>I imagine there's a randomizer for generating villagers and every day problems. In village building, you might roll up a random villager and a problem you need to solve, then go about solving it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258177/#Comment_258177" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T13:17:25+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  1:17PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>Second, tribal people tend not to be too interested in genealogy</blockquote>\nNit-pick: Can we not use the word "tribal" here?

But you could extend that to a fixed, specific person, like "Robert Banesley, blacksmith." Like Roach.<br/><br/>Really, NPCs exist "only" to generate conflicts for the PCs and to make the players care about the village. They provide color for the game. Otherwise, you don't need them (you could have a PC-only village and treat villagers like hit points that get decremented when the enemy does damage). <br/><br/>I started congealing my game in my head on the drive back from Dreamation. I will happily hunt, kill, and eat any ideas you toss out into the wild.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258216/#Comment_258216" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T14:53:47+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  2:53PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2010 2:55PM by jason.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Nit-pick: Can we not use the word "tribal" here? I'm talking about a band level society, not a tribal one.</blockquote>\nSure. Actually, a tribe isn't even as simple as interconnected bands. We could have\u2014and I have had\u2014whole threads hashing out all the anthropological and folk definitions for the word. If you want to avoid all that, I can definitely appreciate that. "Band-level societies," then?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>But seriously, this is an idea I'm interested in exploring so I can put it to rest, more likely than an idea I'm going to labor on for years.</blockquote>\nI will! Actually, just thinking today of how I'd phrase my answer here gave me some focus.<br/><br/>So, I mentioned before that band-level societies tend not to care too much about genealogy. But family matters a great deal. Most often, you have clans. From, actual, tribal societies up to the kind of globalized, industrial civilization that has conversations like this on forums, you get a preoccupation with genealogy. One aspect of this is a tendency to support those more closely related to you over those more distantly related to you; what most people mean by the word "tribalism." You'll support your brother against your cousin, but your siblings and your cousins will all stand together against an outsider. This leads into our modern conception of evolution, too, as we try to trace back the genealogy of animals, and find which ones are most closely related to us.<br/><br/>The clans that you find in band-level societies come from a very different understanding of relation. In that view, coming from the same place makes you more related. So, members of the Bear clan have both two-legged relatives (human members of the Bear clan), and four-legged relatives (actual bears walking around in the forest). Killing either one counts as murder; eating either one counts as cannibalism; marrying either one counts as incest. Meanwhile, you'd probably consider a human from the next watershed over less related to you than a bear that roams the same woods as you. Calvin Luther Martin writes about all this and really helps communicate this kind of perspective to folks of my upbringing (and I'd guess, probably much the same upbringing as most folks who might read this).<br/><br/>So what does that mean? Well, I think it speaks directly to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. Have you ever heard the Lakota phrase, "All my relations"? In band-level societies, everything happens in a social context. Everything happens in the context of kinship. So, what threatens such people? A lack of relationship. People unbound by kinship are an alien, destructive force. And most of the really great stories I've read or heard from band-level societies involve how people establish kinship. It might be establishing kinship for the first time with a stranger (lots of opportunities if you want to have stories that, say, recreate the Columbian experience from the Indians' point of view). It might be re-establishing kinship with someone estranged or alienated by neglected obligations (as when the people get sick, and you find out that deer sent the sickness, because one of your hunters took one more deer than you'd agreed upon and hid it for himself--and now the deer want him to die to balance the scales). It might be a matter of establishing a greater degree of kinship (as in a love story, where you court someone to wed you). So, the threats are breakdowns in kinship, and the PC's are the ones who establish (or re-establish) kinship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
