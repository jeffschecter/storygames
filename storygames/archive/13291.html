Some examples of my favorites are Transmutation magic from Fullmetal Alchemist, Skilling from the Robin Hobb's Farseer novels, or Allomancy from Mistborn. They tend to be more limited in scope than 'traditional' sorcery, and tend to follow rigid, specific rules that the characters can manipulate and exploit.<br/><br/>If you were going to invite such a magic system, either for a game or a novel, how would you set it up? I'm not looking for advice, I'm more curious if any of you have any clever ideas for magic systems that you've devised over the years.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299067/#Comment_299067" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-02T14:14:45+00:00" title="November  2, 2010  2:14PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2010 2:15PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, TSoY is all over this one.

I never got around to making an actual system for it, per se, but had it on the backburner, waiting patiently for the moment I found a system that would work well enough with it.<br/>The basic idea is that magic users would spend their apprenticeship learning the words for certain effects and the true names of common items and animals. Combining one or more effect words with one or more subject words would create the actual spell. Of course, there'd have to be some sort of mechanics to the effects, and some kind of limiting factor determining how many you could use...but that's why this had been on the backburner, really.<br/>Anyway, as the magic user adventures into the wider world, he would slowly collect the true names of other subjects, be they items, animals, people, forces of nature, etc., as well as the occassional effect, rather than digging through spellbooks or such.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, Lady Blackbird would be a suitable system for doing this...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299087/#Comment_299087" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-02T19:25:54+00:00" title="November  2, 2010  7:25PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mulling over something like this <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13171" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13230" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

I am specially pleased by his Magic System. It is both vague enough to remain mysterious, yet constrained enough to make it coherent.<br/><br/>Magic comes from within yourself. You can channel and "shape" that magic by using the (dead) Ancient Language words. In fact, the better you know how to express what you want, the more efficient and reliable your magic is. (Grammar and Spelling <b>are</b> important.) Bad wording can cause your magic to manifest in a very different way you intended it to.<br/><br/>The limits of what magic can do are based upon physical constrains (they directly drain your bodily energy, unless you "store" said energy in gems and stuff, a process that takes a lot of time). You can't tell for sure how much magic some spell would require, so you must be careful. Once the words are spoken, the spell can't be stopped and the drain is inevitable. If you are completely drained, you die. (It is a good thing most magicians are stronger and more resistant than normal humans.)<br/><br/>The better the wizard, the more precise his wordings are and the more efficient energy usage he employs. (If there is a obscure and complicated, but less draining way to do something, why use the easier, flashier and more dangerous way?)<br/><br/>Ever since I read those books, I have been trying to figure a way to "mechanize" this magic system (or something similar to it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299238/#Comment_299238" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-03T18:57:45+00:00" title="November  3, 2010  6:57PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2010 9:25PM by mease19.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I would want magic to be wild and dangerous (but sexy too).  Magic would represent life and change.  I'd set up character attributes and one would be for magic.  Wen you cast a spell, you'd say what you wanted to do.  The GM would then tell you how much magic that required in the form of a difficulty number.  This number represents the amount of magic they would spend if they cast the spell under uninterrupted circumstances, with all the right components, and with as much time as necessary.  Circumstantial inhibition and enhancement from external sources, like magic items, are represented by additional fudge dice (you never know what will happen when things go too fast, are missing components, are cast while running, or when boosted by a magic item or circle).  Basically the more controlled, neutral, and familiar the casting - the more stable the results.  Specializations (like skills/wises) would allow you to remove fudge dice or reduce difficulty number.  <br/><br/>The catch is that when you accidentally run out of magic when casting a spell, you have to trade physical attributes (first strength and vigor, then constitution and health) for magical aspects due to magical mutation (as long as its possible for you cast your spell with the best possible fudge roll, you can still try to cast the spell). The aspects would combine a physical alteration and a mechanical effect.  As you progress, you become physically weaker and magically stronger (those aspects change and enhance you).  Eventually, you teeter on the line between this world and the next.   As the transition occurs, new layers of reality open to you and material layers slough away.  <br/><br/>Of course there's anitmagic as well - it grounds you even more solidly in the "real" world, making you live longer, become stronger, more and less needy, and slower until you are almost geologic (though to you it feels like you're traveling through time faster).  Most antimagic involves meditation, focus and will; using powerful antimagic is not something you do on the fly.  There isn't necessarily conflict between practitioners of either magic or anitmagic and the two powers tend to neutralize each other rather than react.  <br/><br/>The interplay between magic and antimagic allow characters to mutate as much as they want (do they meditate, the antimagic created drawing magic energies back into them, or do they push on and risk metamorphosis).  The difficulty number lets players dole out their magic as they see fit before running out while still giving them lots of freedom to describe the exact effect they want.  The magic aspects add a fantasy transhumanist quality to the game.  When all players reach a certain level of magic (or antimagic): strip the mechanics from their magic aspects and reset their attributes (including magic) and have them transition fully to the new world - at this point you could either retire the character ala emotional traits in Burning Wheel or continue in the new world ala Planescape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299637/#Comment_299637" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-06T21:56:45+00:00" title="November  6, 2010  9:56PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Magic Burner has a pretty cool discussion about what the components of Magic are as it's presented in folklore and fantasy (like that it must have some kind of cost, that it breaks normal rules but has its own internal rules, et cetera).<br/><br/>The magic system I have sitting in the back of my head somewhere is based on Semitic languages (Arabic specifically, but I understand Hebrew works similarly). In Arabic, words have "roots" and "forms". The "root" is three consonants, and it has a loose semantic meaning. Like KTB is associated with books and writing and such. The "forms" are clusters of vowels and consonants inserted before, after, and between the consonants, again with vague semantic meanings. Like _a_a_a is the past tense verb, and ma_ _a_ is a place. So when you put them together, you get specific words, like KiTaB (book - a thing that's written), KaTaBa (he wrote), and maKTaB (office, a place where things are written).<br/><br/>What I want to do is for magic users to be able to learn forms and roots, and be able to put them together on the fly and get the effect out of the interaction of the 'meaning' of each. So, a root associated with fire and a form associated with killing would make a fiery death spell, or something like that. That's not super original, but where it'd get cute is that the dice or cards or runes or whatever would be used in an actual root-form structure (hopefully with some interesting choice making involved - like did you want your spell to be fierier or deathier? Or not to blow up in your face?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299640/#Comment_299640" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-07T00:22:01+00:00" title="November  7, 2010 12:22AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might check out the old superhero game Brave New World, which did for superhero games what you seek to do for magic. Superhero games for many years have been based on the "build whatever superhero you want!" formula, or the "randomly generated superhero" formula. BNW was roundly criticized at the time because it said "there are really only these limited number of superpowers arising in the world, for some reason".  This actually led, as you've noted in fantasy, to a lot of interesting tactics, as you could guess a superstrong dude's other abilities or at least assure yourself he wasn't going to also be able to read your mind.  To a lesser degree, the more recent Gumshoe game, Mutant City Blues, also has this setup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299641/#Comment_299641" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-07T00:42:03+00:00" title="November  7, 2010 12:42AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one's mentioned Mortal Coil yet?

You'd enchant it during a waxing gibbous under the sign of Leo at 10 PM over a fire where you're burning marigolds in a copper brazier (or any other thing you could think of to cram as many correspondencies in as you could).<br/><br/>It basically made all of those "eye of bat, tongue of frog" type spells make sense...and creating spells like that was a bunch of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300176/#Comment_300176" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T18:16:24+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  6:16PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a pretty cool idea, Ralph.

Anyone who fancies themselves a game designer...ESPECIALLY of fantasy RPGs ought to own this book...it really is a treasure and a great example of early publishing as it was published not as a saddle stiched booklet or a "game book" format...but as a hard cover novel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe religion rules were equally fascinating involving a hierarchy of sins which lowered your piety and holy acts (like attending Mass) that would increase it.  You could pray for divine intervention but due to the unlikely hood of the Big Guy actually answering you, you'd need to ask lesser powers to intercede on your behalf...like you'd pray to a saint, who'd ask Mary to intercede with Jesus to get God to grant you a miracle.  Pretty bold stuff for the early 80s, especially since all the saints, angels, and even Jesus and God had game stats...matched by a like collection of devils and demons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was also a totally sweet set of historical minis rules that we played the hell out of.  There were army lists for saxons and vikings and the like.  That was the book that taught me what a Huscarl was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo among all that the magic rules were just a piece...probably no more than 20-30 pages including spell list.  But MAN what a powerfully influencial piece it was.  I STILL have not found a magic system I've enjoyed more than that one.  The spells were super flexible.  You could build spells to kill people by conjuring a shard of stone...in their heart.  Or by binding a sphere of water around their head until they drown.  Build it, then figure out a ritual that would give you good odds of casting it and then store it in a wand or ring for later use.  That was the hermetic section.  For the REALLY powerful stuff you'd conjure up demons or spirits and command them to cast the spell for you.  There was some pretty elaborate conjuring rules where IIRC the strength of the summoning circle depended on how many vertices the inscribed design had...which effected how long it took to draw and how easy it was to mess up.  The most memorable sentence in the entire book I remember to this day: "Be careful what you wish for.  I once ordered a bound genie to 'create light' and he exploded a 30' diameter fireball in a 20' diameter room."  Those silly genies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was the first RPG I ever owned by spending money on and the first RPG I promptly set about hacking the heck out of.  We played it for years.  Mechanically, its pretty dated now.  The primary engine involved stacks of modifiers followed by a roll and table look up...and there was tons o' tables.  But they all worked, and basically was the opposite of "unified mechanic" as each set of tables was like its own mini game...what do I have to do to get good results out of THIS table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
