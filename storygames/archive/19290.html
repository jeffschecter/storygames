If you think you'd like to get in on some of that let me know daniel@hazardgaming.com.<br/><br/>I imagine before committing to such an enterprise though you'd like to know what it's all about so here's the blurb from the website...<br/><br/><br/>You've reached the location to request copies of the playtest documents for Hazard Gaming's latest games Nimbus and das Sonnenrad. So, welcome and thank you for checking things out.<br/><br/>Before continuing though I want to be absolutely clear: no reasonable human being should brook any argument excusing the abhorrent policies and actions of the Nazis. Das Sonnenrad is not a vehicle for perpetuating, even in fiction, the evil of Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>Nimbus and das Sonnenrad are games about the sacrifices made on our behalf by people we will never know. Both games are set against the backdrop of World War Two but I am very aware that these types of sacrifice are not restricted to wartime, nor to soldiers. Every day people give everything for the well-being of others. I'd like to think I'd do the same but hope I never have to find out.<br/><br/>While it is undoubtedly easier to inhabit the mind-space of an Allied soldier risking everything for freedom, my hope is that some of you will accept the challenge of playing the "bad guys".<br/><br/>Das Sonnenrad opens in 1945 with all characters fully aware of the atrocities conducted by the Reich. However, they must also contend with the certainty that failure will likely lead to their loved ones falling victim to the depredations of Soviet troops advancing on Berlin. You will have many difficult decisions to make and I thank you in advance for attempting the challenge of reconciling these facts.<br/><br/><br/>So there you go. Drop me a line if it sounds like something you'd be interested in taking a look at and offering a little feedback.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429643/#Comment_429643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-19T12:54:30+00:00" title="March 19, 2014 12:54PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being german myself I might have  different perspective to offer for Das Sonnenrad.

There are  two sides to choose from and Nimbus plays from the allied side in a classic adventure style game so that should be "safe". To be clear though, das Sonnenrad is the story of a group of Germans who have some difficult choices to make caught between a rock and a hard place. There should be nothing in it to revolt anyone unless a group takes it in that direction.<br/><br/>There's no tacit or even implied endorsement of Hitler or the third Reich.<br/><br/>I'd be more than happy to send you a copy though, and you can judge for yourself.

I've only recently watched it, and the 1979 remake (don't discount it; Ernest Borgnine fills the screen in every scene he's in). Also makes me want to revisit "Das Boot" <br/><br/>Wiki clip: " Set during World War II, the film tells the fictional story of U-96 and its crew. It depicts both the excitement of battle and the tedium of the fruitless hunt, and shows the men serving aboard U-boats as ordinary individuals with a desire to do their best for their comrades and their country." <br/><br/>I'm not usually big on highly focused "premise" games but this seems like it rises above merely "playing at war".

Certainly the point of the piece is to show that all humans are human, regardless of stripe, underneath it all they have human concerns and human dilemmas.  If you get close enough and actually pay attention, you can humanize anyone, even a nazi soldier or a psycho-killer.  I believe that's generally true and it's a very deep point to make.  But I think some social kneejerk against the game will come from the fact that many people don't <i>want</i> to humanize nazi soldiers.

Which is a good way to start I suppose but takes one source of conflict that would be true to late war operations of WW2, which would be still having fanatics around. But it is a good choice to not make it about playing Nazis and in the background scenes the loss of faith, if there ever was any can be used.<br/>Meeting with Hitler directly to get the task and the supernatural event puts the whole setting into pulp territory from the start, which allows to play it safe and have fun with the movie villain version of Nazis. But if the players do want to go deeper the potential is there and the working directly for Hitler part takes away the ability to deny who they really are working for. So that the characters have to face that topic.<br/><br/>I am not sure if the game is the perfect tool to think about the Nazi soldiers as people and to experience their motivations. But it can work like elevated pulp films (for example Inglorious Basterds or Peckinpah's Cross of Iron) work, still having fun roleplaying while still hitting the topics. But I assume you aren't going the Misery Tourism route here anyway.<br/><br/><br/>To critique how the game works I really would have to play it. The scene structure and lists make sense from reading but it does not tell too much about how it actually plays. I fear that I will not be able to provide a german playtest quickly. But I will try and talk with a few other people about the game.<br/>I do think it might be an enjoyable and / or thought provoking experience but most of that would depent on the group around the table. I do not feel the game pushing for either too much.<br/><br/>I hope this helps a little. If I read it again or have more thoughts I will post about that again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hazard" title="hazard"><img alt="hazard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hazard">hazard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430475/#Comment_430475" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-03T07:45:39+00:00" title="April  3, 2014  7:45AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you <a href="/forums/profile/Biest">@Biest</a> for taking the time to read it through.
