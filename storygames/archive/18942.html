It was the session about an easter parade but the few Easter facts they knew were just enough for them to misinterpret everything.</blockquote>\nAh yes, I remember that game. IRC, Vuff (shapeshifter/multiple forms) became loads of 'ickle bunny rabbits, and when the aliens were stopped by the cops at one point and shot at when they ignored their command to pull over, one of the PCs used either power manipulation or teleporting to make the cop's bullets ricochet back and burst the police car's tyres. \n<blockquote>Is that the big buy in point?  That you will willingly misinterpret the human culture things?</blockquote>\nIt's one of them. Forex, in an Xmas party scenario I ran at Indiecon, they got the idea about there being a big bird, but got it a big wrong and stole the football team's mascot, which just <i>happened </i>to be the last remaining bald eagle on Terra, and, discovering that Xmas was a sort of religious event and that such events were usually accompanied by sacrifices, sacrificed the bald eagle in the middle of Miguel Benitez Square on Xmas Day. In fact it was Dahod (doppelganger) who did the actual sacrificing, while making people believe he was the Dean. So yeah, pretty much. There are other selling points, which I'll go into here if anybody's interested, but I'm a wee bit reluctant to do so otherwise, not because I'm being coy but because I've been banging on about it for months now and I don't want to risk overkill. <br/><br/>However, here's a ink to <a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/rpgitem/125834/sci-fi-beta-kappa-1km1kt" rel="nofollow">the <i>current</i> RPGGeek page</a> (I'll put up a new one when 1e is officially out), where I've posted all the AP reports, some of which give you an insight into various aspects of the game and the overall design process.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423630/#Comment_423630" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-01T17:17:40+00:00" title="November  1, 2013  5:17PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2013 5:44PM by catty_big.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so the big launch isn't going to be today after all (at least not outside the UK), as the files that were acceptable for my local POD printer to work from are it seems unacceptable to onebookshelf. Every time I try to upload the insides file it says I need to embed all fonts- Yep, I've no problem with that- but it goes on to say that it's detected Arial and Arial Bold in the document- well, I don't know how it's detected that as there's no Arial anywhere in the text, I've gone through it line by line.<br/><br/>Anyway, upshot is it's probably going to take me a couple of weeks to get this sorted, so apologies to my overseas customers who were hoping to bag themselves a copy today, but I will do my level best to get it up before the end of the month.

The original 1e was going to include some absolutely stunning artwork by someone we know on the roleplaying scene (i.e. one of the few that isn't either a programmer or a teacher), but she'd been having some family stuff to deal with and got further and further behind with the work, and eventually Dan and I took the decision (reluctantly, because we really like her work and it would have made a big difference to the book) to make the demo version 1e. <br/><br/>However, there are a number of crucial differences. First, I've tidied up the back cover, which now has neater speech bubbles, and generally looks a lot more professional. Secondly, I've changed the typefaces, which are now UltraCondensedSansSerif and Optima, and I've centred the headers, hoovered up several typos and added an acknowledgements page. We were going to charge \xa311-12 for 1e, but since we don't have the artwork the insides are effectively b/w (although we've kept the clipart just to break the text up a bit) so we're charging \xa39 for it, or \xa37 to playtesters. <br/><br/>So, if you have a copy of the ashcan version, should you buy a copy of 1e? Obviously I'm <i>slightly</i> biased, but my objective response is: as the rules are exactly the same, if you're not too fussed about the design, you needn't buy 1e. OTOH, as a result of all the tidying up I've done, overall it's much cleaner and slicker, so on that basis you might consider investing in a copy. <br/><br/>Below are links to the new versions of both insides* and cover:<br/><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/SFBK%20(cover).pdf" rel="nofollow">new cover</a><br/><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/SFBK.pdf" rel="nofollow">new insides</a><br/><br/>I hope that clears things up.<br/><br/>P.S. Stand by for AP reports of two very different games I ran at Indiecon.<br/><br/>*We've reduced the publicly available content to that which is helpful for GMs to print off.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/beasterbrook" title="beasterbrook"><img alt="beasterbrook" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/beasterbrook">beasterbrook</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424267/#Comment_424267" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T00:22:47+00:00" title="November 16, 2013 12:22AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll take one..<br/><br/>Brette:)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428142/#Comment_428142" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-09T05:41:54+00:00" title="February  9, 2014  5:41AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2014 5:42AM by catty_big.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hurrah!
