I spent too much of the session trying to find interesting ways to provide the players with adversity that challenged their goals and beliefs and skipping pointless roadblocks - when pointless and infuriating and uncomprehending roadblocks from the slave owners, etc. would have made things much better.<br/><br/>If you wanted a bit more about our actual games... I ran a one-shot of SAJ in part because it's the only game I own my wife has ever expressed an interest in trying (she was very worried that she wasn't "doing it right" afterwards but otherwise seemed to enjoy it).  The setting was on one of the Sea Islands (in the area of Gullah culture), during the summer season when many slave owners leave for the mainland (though all the players opted to have *their* owners be staying on the island).  But since I'd only played once and not run it before, we otherwise tried to run it pretty straightforwardly (no hacks, odd character concepts, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176365/#Comment_176365" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-26T21:49:17+00:00" title="October 26, 2008  9:49PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't run it yet, but there are really only two sources of conflict - between the slaves and the owners/overseers and among the slaves themselves. You could run a game with either as the main conflict, but in most cases it would be a combination of both. And as in any game it's important that the goals of the slaves not be so different that the game fragments into a number of separate stories or subplots that never resolve.<br/><br/>As for tone - It's obvious that conflict among the slaves would rarely set up one slave or faction as truly evil. Instead it would be between two individuals or groups with their own interests at hand - and perhaps different ways of coping with being slaves.<br/><br/>In the same way, the owners should rarely be represented as evil. They rationalized slavery by defining slaves as not-human, and even if owners did have misgivings about it,since abolishing it would mean destroying both the owner's culture and their means of survival, even an owner who is compassionate and generous would have limits that would be hard and fast. In fact, the frustration of an owner being confronted with a choice between his compassion and his family's survival (or at least lifestyle) would be an important boundary condition for conflicts. In most cases owners would avoid thinking about it - keeping their emotional distance from the rank and file slaves in the same way they would from livestock, while household slaves might be treated closer to pets - compassionately but patronizingly. But always there would be boundaries, both literal and figurative, to limit what they could do.<br/><br/>The conflict comes when something happens that upsets that delicate equilibrium - forcing both the slaves and their masters to either take a stand, back down, or come to some kind of compromise representing a new equilibrium in the relationship.<br/><br/>In fact, you really have to run the owner/overseer as a full-fledged character and not just a background function - a character whose primary goal is to maintain the status quo at all costs. That tension is the primary goal that should overarch everything else in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176379/#Comment_176379" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T00:57:06+00:00" title="October 27, 2008 12:57AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: drunkencatgirl</cite>So, I've read Kyle Baker's Nat Turner and it reminded of Steal Away Jordan waiting to be played (and lying in the pile of other unused games).

The slaves discuss their goals together but they don't all have to have a common goal, and they don't even have to be on the same side.<br/><br/>The thing with slaves is that whilst they are valuable they are replacable and there's no reason why an owner should not replace, or at least heavily correct a recalcitrant slave. Playing an owner as a tyrant is just a valid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176502/#Comment_176502" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T21:57:12+00:00" title="October 27, 2008  9:57PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2008 10:07PM by Number6intheVillage.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't make for a practical game. And a tyrant owner is just an easy target - but correcting or replacing a slave wouldn't count as being tyrannical anyway. Maiming and murder would.<br/><br/>I think the best way to play something like this is to create a situation where things are in equilibrium (as they were 99% of the time) and then add something that disrupts it, creating a single overarching plot with room for a number of subplots (rather than a number of separate full-fledged plot lines).<br/><br/>And that brings up goals. I would define a goal as something that is realistically attainable in the context of the status quo. A goal that forces a major change to the status quo would really be a dream - not a practical goal. For example, escape might be a dream for almost all slaves - but could only really become a goal when the situation became conducive to it (or the alternative became unbearable). And that's where you get your plot complications from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
