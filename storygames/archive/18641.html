I ran this one and John ran the other.<br/><br/><b>The PCs:</b><br/>Celest the Immortal Explorer (Marcy) and Genji the Still-Around, also an Immortal Explorer (Brendan). They both specialized in Cunning, Insight and Charm. We learned later that John's group put most of their points and bonus dice into Battle and Action type stuff, much to their regret.<br/><br/><b>The Threats:</b><br/>A Beast Zeppelin from the ruins, a Robot Cult in the caves, Robot Predators in the desert, Winged Supremacists above the waterfall, and a Reformed Robot Cult at the freshwater springs. Oddly enough, they all had Weaknesses to Cunning, Insight and/or Charm. <br/><br/>We began by discussing the rules as well as the basic premise of Gamma World, then brainstorming a little about the Threats and their locations. I suggested that the Reformed Robot Cult might be trying to seize control the Village's water supply. Marcy added that the Cave Cult believes that all technology must be rebuilt and continually improved, while the Reformed Cult believes that the Robot is the apex of technology and that the very idea of improvement is heresy. Brendan suggested that the Robot Predators are big eight-legged lizards with huge metal-gnashing magnesium teeth bioengineered to eat robots. Someone thought the caves might be connected to the old sewer system of the nearby ruins. I asked for the name of the ruined city, suggesting the old Gamma World trope of taking the name of a big modern city and removing a letter or two. The Threat locations seemed to be describing a Death Valley, painted desert type place, so maybe something like Phoenix? Brendan thought that the centuries of climate change should place it further north, and suggested "Ontreal."<br/><br/>When I finally noticed that the two PCs were both Immortal Explorers, I asked about their backgrounds. Brendan said that Genji's memory is spotty and he could be 2000 years old for all he knows. I asked if they became immortal together or just ran into each other one day, two cursed souls wandering the earth. Marcy approved and suggested that they met that way long ago. I suggested that the Village could be entirely composed of their descendents, but Brendan preferred to say that they'd gathered lots of other wandering survivors here over the many years. Marcy added that they've been defending this village for so long that they've actually observed the current Threats evolving around them over time, and have deep insight into their natures and origins. They were once friends of the ancestors of the Winged Supremacists, for instance, who were nice and pleasant neighbors, and have watched with great sadness as their descendents have mutated into the awful monsters that threaten the Village today.<br/><br/>Celest's Special Ability as an Immortal was her bond with the local ecosystem. Marcy said she knows all of the creatures of the area very well and they all owe her favors. She's always been very helpful to them and they come to her aid when she needs it. Her Explorer Special Ability was an Ancient Telescope. She expressed skepticism about its usefulness.<br/><br/>Genji's Abilities were Pseudo-Telepathy (he's been around so long and has talked to so many people that he can accurately guess what everyone is thinking) and a rickety homemade Grappling Gun.<br/><br/>I asked them how they'd prefer to start the game, by defending against an attack or by taking preemptive action against one of these Threats? Because, I assured them, they both definitely somehow know that things are about to start happening any minute now, and that they probably only have enough time for a single action each before it all kicks off.<br/><br/>Brendan wants to take on the Beast Zeppelin. I say, OK, what are you gonna do about it? Marcy declares that Celest sees the Zeppelin coming over the horizon, drifting over the mountains from the ruins of Ontreal. She sounds the alarm. I ask if there are warriors in the Village. Brendan doesn't think there's an army, maybe a militia fighting with weaponized Stop signs and scrap metal and mutant powers, and a few ex-cultist robots who broke their programming long ago. I add that they've probably recruited plenty of battle-hardened ex-wanderers over the years, and that with his Pseudo-Telepathy, Genji knows which ones he can trust to protect the Village. I ask if they're establishing some sort of defensive position. Brendan says no, they're all quickly concealing the Village under gigantic painted tarps.<br/><br/>Genji looks through Celest's telescope and reads the intent on the faces of the oncoming Beasts. I suggest that the Zeppelin is in some sort of disguise, maybe as a diplomatic vessel or cargo ship, but that Genji sees through it. Brendan adds a couple of d6s, saying that everyone must stay perfectly still or it will give away their position. I say that it's at least 1d6 more dangerous because they're trusting the artist of the Village, who painted all the tarps, and Genji hasn't had time to doublecheck his work. Brendan admits that he is a bit of a free spirit.<br/><br/>Brendan rolls and we interpret the results. I bring in a hack of my own, which requires us to color our narration according to which die types hit and missed, e.g. if the d10s hit and the d8s missed, then you must describe how your Special Abilities failed to help and how your skillfulness saved the day.<br/><br/>The Beast Zeppelin is defeated! Someone said something about the artist deserving a raise, which must mean that those d6s were hits. I suggest that the tarp is painted with a realistic bird's eye view of ruined buildings and lots of trail marks leading away into the desert, and that the Beasts are convinced that the Robots must have finally gotten them. The Zeppelin floats off in search of other prey, no longer a Threat to the Village.<br/><br/>Brendan rolled more than six hits and gained a d8 Reward: Wealth. I suggest that a traveling caravan was in town, which is why the Beast Zeppelin chose today to attack. The traders are very grateful and make a large contribution to the Village fund. He also rolled enough Danger for a Complication, which he defined as a Hacking Cough he got from fighting a fire that broke out when a section of the tarp fell onto a hot stove.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich" title="Seth_Magdich"><img alt="Seth_Magdich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth_Magdich">Seth_Magdich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418775/#Comment_418775" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-21T22:55:18+00:00" title="July 21, 2013 10:55PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone suggests that the Robot Cult saw everything that just happened and now want to steal the Village's incredible new giant-tarp stealth technology in order to sneak-attack the Reformed Robot Cult. I suggest that they might also want to kidnap the artist who painted them. Marcy declares that they're now slowly marching towards the Village, leaving the shelter of their caves, and that Celest is going to alert the Robot Predators to their presence. She hikes out to their territory, using her bond with the ecosystem to find just the right spot, and sets up her Ancient Telescope (1d8) to point straight at the Robots marching in the distance. Because who can resist looking through a telescope?<br/><br/>We decide that this is especially dangerous because she had to set it up at the last minute, waiting to see which path the Robots were going to march along, and now she might not get away in time. Brendan adds that she also left a trail of scrap metal leading up to the telescope, which took even more time. She dives for cover as the Predators approach!<br/><br/>Marcy rolls and defeats the Robot Cult but gets taken out herself. We decide that the Predators did indeed look through the telescope and attacked and devoured the entire Robot Cult, but that one of the Predators also tried to eat the telescope. Celest was last seen being dragged off to the caves, still trying to pry it out of its mouth.<br/><br/>End of round, Marcy rolls 3d6 for the remaining Threats and gets zero hits against the Village.<br/><br/>Brendan wants to Rescue Celest, leading his mutants-at-arms into battle despite his Hacking Cough. Marcy says she's trying to negotiate with the Predators but the crunching of metal is so loud that they can't even hear her. Genji uses his Grappling Gun (1d8) to swing along the canyon walls to reach the entrance to the caves and throw ropes down to his men.<br/><br/>Brendan rolls overkill and gets a d8 Reward: Alliance / Friends, interpreting it as a new treaty with the Robot Predators. He suggests that Celest had already finished negotiations by the time they arrived. I argue that, since his stated action was to take arms against them, the show of force should be the decisive factor in rescuing her. I narrate that the Predators clearly fear the strength of the Village's warriors and their non-metallic bone axes, and agree to join them in a temporary alliance against the Reformed Robot Cult. I speculate about the possible effects of the freshwater springs on their magnesium teeth.<br/><br/>Marcy wants to take out the Robot Predators and narrates Celest sending them into a suicidal battle. One suggested danger is that she must go with them personally, another is that she must actually lead the charge by riding one of them. She uses the Alliance bonus against them (convincing them to begin their attack in the wettest and least advantageous part of the battlefield), rolls the dice and defeats them. She takes a couple of d4s, representing injuries sustained from exploding teeth and burning debris.<br/><br/>Marcy rolls 2d6 against the Village and gets zero hits. Her strategy of pitting their enemies against each other and keeping the Village out of it is working perfectly.<br/><br/>Brendan suggests that Genji has hidden many caches of supplies in the desert over the countless years. He finds one, disarms his old boobytraps, and attempts to use the ancient medicine inside to cure his Hacking Cough. He rolls and defeats the Complication, but suffers another Complication ("Mildly Poisoned") in the process.<br/><br/>Marcy targets the Winged Supremacists next, saying that they've been getting too close to the Village lately and that Celest has arranged an aquatic ambush to take them out. She suggests that they usually feed by diving en masse into a school of fish and carrying their prey away in their talons. This time, though, something else will be waiting for them... She rolls and wins easily, describing the bird-men plunging into the water, into the arms of the waiting mutant octopi who catch and drown them all.<br/><br/>She rolls up a d8 Reward: Romance. I suggest that there's a villager who's been catching her eye lately and that he's been watching in awe and reverence as she manipulates all of these horrible monsters into killing each other. She adds that he now fights by her side in an attempt to prove his loyalty and love for her.<br/><br/>Marcy rolls 1d6 against the Village and gets zero hits.<br/><br/>Brendan takes a recovery and restores Marcy's bonus dice. I suggest that Genji had another Ancient Telescope in one of his hidden caches, which he now presents to Celest.<br/><br/>We decide that the remaining members of the Reformed Robot Cult are marching on the Village. Celest prepares to destroy them, but Brendan talks her into trying to form an alliance with them instead. She agrees and suggests that since they just saw her trick their enemies into killing themselves, it shouldn't be too difficult. She adds the bonus from her new telescope, using it to determine the best place to intercept them. She also adds the bonus d8 from her Romance, describing him as an exceptional diplomat and sending him out to parley with the Robots. I suggest that the Robots' sensors can calculate your sincerity from your voice patterns, facial expressions and body language, and they can clearly detect that this guy is totally convinced that Celest is invincible. Brendan wants to add the bonus from his Pseudo-Telepathy, so I suggest that Genji was the one who originally told her about their sensors and how to take advantage of them. Marcy adds that she's been planning this whole thing for ages and that she must have arranged for that villager to fall in love with her so that he'd be that much more persuasive when dealing with the Reformed Robot Cult.<br/><br/>She rolls and wins, getting tons of hits and no Danger at all and gaining a d8 Reward: Technology. We decide that the Robots, convinced of Celest's power and grateful to her for the destruction of the Predators, lower their weapons and join the Village.<br/><br/>That's the last Threat and the end of the game. Village: 5, Threats: 0. They skunked Gamma World!<br/><br/>Afterwards, we checked in with John's group and compared notes. Sadly, their combat-oriented characters got trounced and their Village was destroyed. But it did inspire John to create the Lead The People Away From This Terrible Place rule, which is pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
