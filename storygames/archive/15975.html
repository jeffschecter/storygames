But I have a guilty secret: I have never run a game with characters higher than about 4th level. What does OD&amp;D become when you start hitting this level? How do I make that happen?<br/><br/>And a couple more specific questions:<br/><br/>- This is about the time in some traditions where we start seeing followers and strongholds appear. Our party is at the point where they could reasonable start setting up some kind of headquarters in the dungeon. There are friendly monster groups and an underground tavern where followers might be found. How are people handling followers and strongholds in Dungeon World?<br/><br/>- We're starting to reach the point where the walls of the megadungeon are becoming more porous. By this I mean that the PCs are a bit less constrained by the physical walls of the megadungeon. They can do "dangerous journey" between dungeon segments and have experienced at least some occurrences of teleportation, dimensional travel, and scrying across dungeon areas (with more of this to come). As I recall from my AD&amp;D days, this represented something of a sea chance in how adventures transpired. How do I prepare?<br/><br/>Does anyone have any thoughts, ideas, or anecdotes to help guide "high level" DW play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363429/#Comment_363429" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T11:36:10+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 11:36AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 11:36AM by Troy_Costisick.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite><br/>- This is about the time in some traditions where we start seeing followers and strongholds appear.

I played a lot with followers as a fight, cleric, and ranger, and 9th is the earliest you started getting them.  As for 6th level, that's when the dungeon-based encounters were really at their best.  You finally got mass heal, fireball, lightning bolt, and other powerful spells plus saving throws were finally high enough that the DM could actually start casting spells on the players without having to fear TPK.  <br/><br/>6th, 7th, and 8th levels is where you started fighting realy scary monsters like Vampires, Medusas, Rust Monsters, Firbolgs, Ogre Magi, and Necromancers.<br/><br/>EDIT: just wanted to add, though, that having rules for followers in DW would be awesome! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363434/#Comment_363434" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T11:42:09+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 11:42AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see an Level Up selection for "gain a follower". Maybe a 0-level type? I believe Jason M. or someone else was playing DW w 0-level players recently.<br/><br/>I know that D&amp;D doesn't have strongholds until 9th level. But my feeling is that most DW campaigns are going to be more compacted in actual play than the 2-5 year monstrosities we had in the 80s. So maybe 6-8th level does feel fine to build something.<br/><br/>The thing I like about strongholds in DW is that it gives the GM more things to play with vis-a-vis the front and threat rules. This was something that was always hand-waved in D&amp;D and AD&amp;D, but now there are codified rules to make it more interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363440/#Comment_363440" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T11:50:26+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 11:50AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've put a little bit of thought into the sorts of stuff covered by the Expert / Champions component of B/X or the 9th level + of AD&amp;D but nothing official, yet.  If anything, that'll come from a compendium.<br/><br/>For reference, though, the Hard Holder and the Chopper and the Hocus and the like all have excellent moves for creating groups of people.
