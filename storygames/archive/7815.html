I'd enjoy any suggestions on improvements or words of caution.<br/>\n<br/>\n4e: Tandun of the Underdark<br/>\n<br/>\nDeep in the underdark Tandun, an ancient red dragon, lurks.<br/>\nEach player gives a reason why they want to go kill Tandun.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach session all players start with 2 White Tokens.<br/>\nA player may spend a White Token by:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Introducing an element relating to their character\u2019s reason to kill Tandun.  All players gain 100XP.<br/>\n2. Tie in an existing element to their character\u2019s reason to kill Tandun. All players gain 100XP.<br/>\n3. Use as an Action Point in combat. All Players receive 0XP.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach session, a bowl of Red Tokens equal to the number of players is placed on the table.<br/>\nA player may pull a Red Token from the bowl and give it to another player when they feel the other player:<br/>\n1. Introduced an element they thought was really cool<br/>\n2. Roleplayed in a really cool way.<br/>\n3. Made a remarkable strategic choice in battle.<br/>\n4. Rolled an amazing hit at just the right moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nA player may spend a Red Token by:<br/>\n1. Adding +2d8 (take highest) to any dice roll.  All Players receive 0XP.<br/>\n2. Giving their character a secondary reason to be in the group and in the underdark.  All players receive 200 XP.<br/>\n3. Introducing an element related to the character\u2019s secondary reason for being in this group or exploring the Underdark.  All players receive 200XP.<br/>\n4. Introducing an element or information that creates a possible conflict with two or more character\u2019s reason to kill Tandun.  All players gain 500XP.  Subject to negotiation.  If rejected by any player, then all players receive 100XP, and such factual elements no longer an option to be introduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM frames scenes and presents combat challenges to the players.

It has a lot of moving parts, and not everything is clicking, but there may be some stuff you can borrow and hack to your liking.<br><br>First, the centerpiece:\n<blockquote><b>Quests</b><br><br>Players announce quests by combining a purpose and a goal, where the purpose is the verb phrase describing what the characters need to do and the goal is the noun-phrase identifying the target or objective of the quest. <br><br>The goal of a major quest is an element from the Uerlan map. The goal of a minor quest is anything else.<br><br>Write the resulting phrase down on an index card in the format [Purpose] {Goal}. So for example:<br><br>Major Quest: [Discover] {where the Lost God of Humanity is imprisoned}.<br>Major Quest: [Save]\u2026 {the Children of the Sun} \u2026[from the yuan-ti].<br>Minor Quest: [Convince]\u2026 {my family} \u2026[that I\u2019m worthy of their respect].<br><br>There can be up to two major quests and N minor quests in play at any given time, where N is the number of players at the table.<br><br>When a quest is declared, specify the level of the quest (from 1 to 10 on the heroic tier). Multiply the level of the quest by three for a major a quest and one for a minor quest. This is the sum of the levels of the encounters that must be completed for the quest to be fulfilled. So a Level 1 minor quest can be fulfilled with a single Level 1 encounter, while a Level 5 major quest needs 15 encounter levels dedicated to it. So after the Level 1 encounter, 14 encounter levels remain in the quest, which could be completed with a level 4 encounter, two level 3 encounters, and two level 2 encounters, for example, or any other combination of encounters totaling 14.<br><br>To add uncertainty, you may optionally roll 1d4+1 to determine the level multiplier for any given quest instead of using a straight \u201c3\u201d. <br><br>When a minor quest is fulfilled, players split xp equal to the standard xp value for a monster of the quest\u2019s level. When a major quest is fulfilled, each player receives the standard xp value for a monster of the quest\u2019s level. So, for fulfilling a 3rd level minor quest, five players split 150 xp, gaining 30 xp each. For fulfilling a 3rd level major quest, which would require 15 levels worth of encounters dedicated to it, five players each gain 150 xp each.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nWhen I described this system to the players, one guy said, "Oh, so you're Inspectre-izing D&amp;D." And I said yeah. <br><br>Notice that's what nice about this is that invites players to provide rationalizations for why a particular encounter helps fulfill Quest A versus Quest B. To enable this game-mechanically, I've added SOTC-like "declarations" to the game. So, for example, in a fight against a kraken, one player declared that kraken horn was known for its medicinal value, in aid of another player's quest to find medicine for his sick father. Skill challenges, similarly, can be <i>sick</i> with player authoring.\n<blockquote><b>Declarations and Inquiries</b><br><br>As a minor action, you can make a skill roll to make a declaration about some element of the encounter or the game-world more generally. Your declaration should specify the skill you\u2019re using and the fact you\u2019re stipulating. The DM decides if the declaration is plausible or interesting. If it\u2019s both, the DC of the check is easy; if it\u2019s one or the other, the DC is standard; if it\u2019s neither, the DC is hard.<br><br>On a successful roll, the player\u2019s declaration is taken to be true; if it fails, the GM draws a card from the Deck of Many Things and uses it to determine the real truth.<br><br>Alternately, once per encounter, you can take a free action to make an inquiry about how some element of the encounter or game-world relates to one of the quests the characters are pursuing. In this case, you merely specify the skill you\u2019re using to explore, investigate, or otherwise engage with something in the encounter. The DC is always standard. On a success, draw a card from the Deck of Many Things and read it as saying something about the connection between the thing on the map/in the encounter and the object or pursuit of the quest. On a failure, let the GM read the card.<br><br>A successful declaration or inquiry may result in a new game-element being added to the Uerlan map, to a new fact being added to an existing game-element, or merely to a situational bonus being applied to certain actions during the current encounter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nIf you're curious about the references to the "Deck of Many Things" above, let me explain. I have a deck of cards from the Game Mastery line that's been designed like the old Deck of Many Things from 1st and 2nd edition D&amp;D. I use it as a tarot deck by assigning each card one of the gods from the 4th edition PHB and their associated domains. So you can draw a card and if it's "Balance" for example, that stands for Bahamut and his domains of justice, nobility, honor, and protection. Depending on the situation, that card can be interpreted for its significance to current circumstances and used to add something to the game.<br><br/>I recommend adopting some kind of "oracular" technique: it acts as a prompt to creativity, and serves as a little bit of a constraint on going too far, since others can always demand that you connect what you're saying to the card you drew.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173899/#Comment_173899" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T12:57:37+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:57PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>\n<br/>\nI like your idea. Now, for a way to limit the number of Action tokens they can get per session (I could see the technique getting a bit out of hand, which might not be a bad thing).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I think about this, though, the more I wonder if I'm just in that niche of Story-Game players, who is the lone member of a larger group of players that do not want to explore a theme during play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd have to say, and I don't want this to sound too negative, but I think the players in my group prefer to game with Themeless Fighty Drones (TFD).  That phrase might be a bit too pejorative.  They will handwavingly recognize any theme presented by the GM, but they won't get invested.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider WOW.  Characters are essentially TFDs. 90% the time you don't read the quest color, just the specifics of what is required.  My group loves WOW.  60% of game time is essentially talking about WOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been trying to GM 4e as an alternative to the WOW TFD fest.  But it is rare when a player presents any sort of theme.  It seems almost all theme comes from me, and in that it seems like a reverse-bastardization of the Czege principle, "Picking and exploring my own theme without anyone else involved is boring."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, clearly adding theme is not going to work.  How do I, as GM, compete with WOW fun?<br/>\nRather than pull them kicking and screaming toward theme, how can I push them further and forward in to TFD fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes for a good, fun TFD type of game?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Strategically difficult Combat - Check (4e does this really well).<br/>\n-Crunched Out Character Build Options - Weak Check (4e does poorly, I see the character build in this game more of a Pick your fighty Template, than make a unique,  finetuned, crunchified fighting machine).<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other suggestions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173907/#Comment_173907" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T13:20:23+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  1:20PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hang on...<br><br>So:<br><br>1.

I said:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my understanding that, we as a group 1.) Want to show off our table-top gaming, chops, 2) See our characters grow in tactical powers more than character growth or plot 3.) Just a basic rationale why the group is a group and fighting things, 4) we want to experience play more as "my character" more than "our story."<br/>\n<br/>\nI think many of the points I made here are pretty blunt, and point out that as GM I'm not going to spend too much down time pondering Theme or even bothering with any sort of mystery to solve.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne player seemed to notice the blunt and real theme killing tone of those expectations.  I'm not sure what he said exactly-- I think he had more of a complaint that I didn't take a poll and ask people before I laid out the observations. But I've been gaming with them for so long, and I know how resistant the group is to self-reflect on gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the other players seemed too bothered by it.  Then the conversation about the expectation of the game never came up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been slowly reducing the amount of theme and such each game session more and more.<br/>\nThis latest "i'm done with content" is just the next step.<br/>\nIn a way, maybe I'm curious just how far this group will go before they call out for theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173944/#Comment_173944" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T15:31:31+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  3:31PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rust, forgive me if I'm presumptuous, but it seems to me that you need to rethink your approach. This whole "theme" thing seems to be something your group is not interested in, and trying to artificially remove it from the game just to prove a point seems like it'll hurt the game more than help.<br><br>As an alternative, have you researched the theory behind challenge-based fantasy adventure gaming? Have you tried it? The fourth edition D&amp;D has not been written with this in mind, but it seems that you're not playing it by the book anyway, so it should be easy to go to this direction, instead. I'm asking because it seems that your group is looking for a) non-thematic roleplaying and b) the strengths that the tabletop form has over MMORPGs. It just so happens that such play does exist; it's not necessary to work with theme in the literary sense to make rpgs compete with computers.<br><br>The tricky part of the matter, though, is that there really isn't very good sources for this style of roleplaying. &lt;&lt;a href="<a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/challenge-based-adventuring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://isabout.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/challenge-based-adventuring/</a>"&gt;I wrote something about my own understanding last year, but it's not like I have all the answers lined up there. Still, perhaps something along those lines could work for you? Instead of struggling with theme, start to think of the game content as a strategic field shared by the players and held together by their common investment in the fictional situation. What you tell about your group and their disinterest in story creation sounds to me like they might be interested in something like this.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174097/#Comment_174097" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T09:43:04+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  9:43AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 9:47AM by Rustin.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the reply.<br/>\nI've read your link.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe breakdown, at least for my particular group, happens when my players fail to "engage with the situation of the scenario in a constructive manner."  They have yet to, as far as I can recall, "signify any subject matter that they fancy."<br/>\n<br/>\nOur group has had numerous GM provided campaigns and situations ignored by the players.  (As a player personally, I did write up complex kickers, and tried to engage in the world provided-- but, oddly the GMs would never pick up on it, or allow my creative participation to affect their situation).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, not to be too pessimistic, but I don't think this particular group would engage any situation, which is required for your Challenge Based Adventuring techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a clarification, I'm not trying to remove Theme per se.  Rather, as GM I'm trying to put forth minimum Theme.  Theme must come from players.  If play is reduced to themeless play (because nobody steps up and offers theme), that is fine, as the tactical battles in 4e are still fun.  I'm just tired of sitting down to the table expecting to play with theme, and being disappointed when it does not happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nBill,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I need a copy of Inspectres to really go with what you're describing.<br/>\nI think the first step-- having the players fill out Quest Goals-- would be like pulling teeth for this group.  I tried to get them to give me reasons they want to kill Tandun. This was very difficult for more than half the players.  Two players almost flatly refused to give any sort of justification, and when pushed gave out really basic, boring reasons.  I stopped pushing at that point, and just started drawing on the battle mat.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul,<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I've been thinking of how to have it reversed, and get Action tokens for introducing Content.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's sort of what I have in mind.<br/>\nEach player has the option to write up a Character Story sheet.  A character story sheet is the 50 words from The Pool.  Then the Player can pull out 3 elements  from the sheet, and they draw little boxes next to the elements as they see fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any point in play if they introduce context in the SIS about those elements they can check a box and earn a White Token.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhite tokens can be spent to add 4 to a roll or to re-roll a dice check. (does not act as an action point)<br/>\nOr, a white token can be spent to add another line to their Story Sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nRed Tokens are fan mail.  Put in a bowl in the table.<br/>\nRed Tokesn are spend to add new boxes on a Story Character Sheet.<br/>\nOr spent to add 2 to a roll or re-roll a dice check.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I don't like the wiff factor of 4e, so re-rolls are fine by me).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like a way for everyone at the table to earn XP.  Probably when one adds a box or a line to their character story sheet.  Or maybe when they check a box on the story sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other suggestions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174100/#Comment_174100" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T09:57:57+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  9:57AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two questions:<br><br>1.

Also the 4e experience leveling rate is too slow for a bi-monthly group, so this speeds up the leveling.  Mostly bribery, often I'll get the "hey, we're only 200xp from next level, how about a quick random encounter before we wrap it up."  XP is a big motivator for this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswer to Manipulation:  I'm way guilty of this.  It is a habit that I'm actually trying to break (hoping that these rules modifications would help with that).  So in a passive aggressive way, perhaps these rules are still manipulation.  "Give them what they want so they realize what they want leaves something out and then they'll come around to understanding that they have to work and participate to get the thematic play they were missing."<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswer to talking to the group:<br/>\nI've known these guys for most my life.  So there are bits and pieces of taking about games spread out over a 20 year history.<br/>\n<br/>\nFormally, and recently, the last time I talked to them was when I took over GMing.<br/>\nI asked, "ok guys, what do you want out of these next sessions?"<br/>\nI received the usual, exasperated, "Oh-no-is-he-going-into-this-roleplay-theory-group-and-self-reflection-talk-again?" non-verbal response.  Finally ending in a slightly irritated answer of "you know what we like.. just more of that stuff." I pointed out that the last few campaigns have fizzled.  But this was vaguely blamed on the campaigns not lasting long enough for everyone to really get into it or GM burn out or both-- though these conclusions have never been specifically called out and blamed.  Nor have we taken any specific steps to address those particular problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I posted on our wiki what I though everyone's expectations of the game was, with little to no response from the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Citizen%20Arcane" title="Citizen Arcane"><img alt="Citizen Arcane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.criminy.net/images/arcane.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Citizen%20Arcane">Citizen Arcane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174392/#Comment_174392" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T15:46:11+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  3:46PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rust,<br>\n<br>\nI recently had a fairly similar experience.<br>\n<br>\nMy group of players has been gaming together for roughly 20 years. We have an every-other-Thursday game and a once-a-month-Saturday game. Mostly the same players in both groups but a bit of variation due to scheduling.  Each group plays in a separate campaign.  They have virtually no interest in any sort of player-motivated gaming.  They seem to be fully content to follow whatever plot or setting that is laid out for them (within a fairly narrow, generic fantasy genre), and have not shown any desire to be pro-active. <br>\n<br>\nIt was driving me CRAZY.  Here I was developing an interest in story-games such as Spirit of the Century, and My Life with Master, but I knew my players would not be on-board for that kind of game.<br>\n<br>\nAs a solution, I had the bright idea of trying a game of Ars Magica (which is all about pro-active, player-driven gaming, but is still fairly traditional is it's mechanics).  It was a pretty  much an abject failure. Whenever I prompted them for what their plans were, or what they wanted to do with their Magi, I was greeted with blank stares and uncomfortable silences.  We played three sessions or so and then I killed it.<br>\n<br>\nI then realized that I wanted something different from my gaming than what they wanted, and there wasn't much I could do to reconcile it.<br>\n<br>\nSo I killed the Thursday group.<br>\n<br>\nI told them that I needed to take a break from GMing, and that I was going to no longer participate in the Thursday group but I would still GM the once-a-month-Saturday game (mainly for social reasons).<br>\n<br>\nI then grabbed the two players who were interested in trying something new, hooked up with some like-minded gamers, and have been having a blast playing My Life with Master, Dogs in the Vineyard, and other new-fangled hippy games.<br>\n<br>\nIt's one of the better choices I've made for my hobby time.<br>\n<br>\n-Pete                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174394/#Comment_174394" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T16:07:11+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  4:07PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2008 4:07PM by Rustin.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pete,<br/>\n<br/>\nHey thanks for the reply.  That is so cool you've found some hippies to play with. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nI had some hippies, but then one got into grad school and moved across the country, and then the others (myself included) got seriously addicted to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Imperium" rel="nofollow">Twilight Imperium,</a> the most enjoyable, challenging, board game I have ever played.   And the hippy story games came to an end.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did, in a way, give up on the group (rather than kill it outright).  I knew that theme, story and such, just wasn't going to happen. So I'd show up to games mostly to socialize and to joke around.  But, my silly hippy itch got the best of me, and I offered to GM, again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the lone hippy in a group of gamers is a very common creature.  (Ala the village atheist analogy).  The general prescription offered to the lone story-hipster is to abandon the group, and find new peoples to play with.  This works.   I'm wondering if there is a second option.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like these guys.  And I think there is a method or rule set that would make their gaming expectations clear.  I'm thinking the "Theme if you want it" option, might be it.  Being very blunt to not have any theme coming from the GM is probably rule <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe, just no theme unless there is more than one person jazzed about that theme....<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, no theme from one player only rule, perhaps?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll have to ponder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174406/#Comment_174406" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T17:08:32+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  5:08PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2008 5:10PM by Ry.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my experience, rules changes can't break that impasse.<br><br>Think of it like this; if your group sat down and decided that they were looking for a game that challenged them to roleplay powerful, flawed characters constantly skirting danger, while constantly asking "how far are you willing to go?"  and "what does it mean to put your humanity on the line?" then you'd play Sorcerer.

They just didn't want this sort of fun, and by trying to impose it I removed all the things both they and I liked about our regular games and stuffed it all up. Luckily I realized in time that I was doing the wrong thing and stopped, and the fun came back. <br><br>Does that mean I had to just give up on the hippie gaming? Not at all. I found my players were quite happy to play that sort of game ... just so long as it wasn't part of our regular game. One-offs, playtests, 3-session mini arcs in between chapters of larger games, IAWA on a weekend, that was all fine (though complicated by scheduling) and went down well, with the main weekly campaign going on as a GM-led GURPS campaign.<br><br>It sounds to me like your players know what they want from this bi-monthly game. They want a series of challenging but low-investment combat encounters and puzzles, lots of treasure, XP, and a GM-led plot that tells them why they are there, doing what they are doing with good strong fantasy tropes (save the city, kill the dragon, take it's stuff). They want a GM to challenge them, and provide enough story that it seems to hang together as much as any MMO does. My advice is, give them that. You seem good at the encounters, and to enjoy the combat, so give them that, it's what they are asking for. You don't need to worry much about theme and story (and pre-preparation effort) because they aren't asking for a lot of that, just enough so it makes sense why they are there. (This is of course why they won't engage with creating content, because it's way down their priority list).<br><br>As Citizen Arcane says, the only other real option is to leave the group (or stop GM'ing) but my instinct says you can keep going *and* play hippie games like I have been doing ... i.e. have your cake and eat it too                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174504/#Comment_174504" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T13:40:08+00:00" title="October 10, 2008  1:40PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been in the same situation.

Very slight opportunity for players to explore theme or character, and it is optional.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 1 (preparation)<br/>\nGM preps a scene for combat.  It includes, map (to be drawn on battlemat), a monster challenge, environmental conditions, scripted events (i.e., events that happen upon certain contingencies).  These scripted events include: environmental changes, monster strategy, etc....  They can be contingent or just happen at a certain time. (E.g., On round 3 the left wall collapses, if half the minions are dead the rest of them run away, etc...).<br/>\n<br/>\nGM comes up with very vague reasons why the Player Characters have encountered the scene including character's reasons why they want to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 2 ( In Medias Res)<br/>\nGM frames the scene.  Characters are described in a situation moments before the fighting starts. GM announces reasons why the characters are here. GM should not offer complex, intricate backstory for the characters reasons to be here.  It should be vague.  (I.e., You found a map about a lost sword. You're a fighter, so assuming you like swords, you came here to kill and plunder for the sword).  GM has the option to include critical information about the creature they are about to fight or the environmental conditions they face. ( E.g., You found a journal in a cave on the way here, which reports that the Ogres in this region fight with poisoned blades).<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 3 (Player's Opportunity to Contribute Backstory)<br/>\nPlayers then each have an opportunity to Block the GM's input.<br/>\nThey can change the backstory that explains why their character is here only.  They cannot change their character's fundamental situation as presented by the GM.  (Possibly the specific tactical position could be set as stake of a Skill Challenge check or Skill Check-- but I don't want to open the Stakes can of worms here).  They cannot say, "My character would never go underground into a dungeon, he's claustrophobic!" They are not allowed to block any the scene's core elements. (i.e., Who, what and where).  Slight modification might make sense.  (E.g., My thief type guy would have hid in the shadows and been over on this side of the wall, is valid, with a successful associated skill check).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers should be rewarded with XP or action tokens for contributing Content which expands, clarifies or completely replaces the GM's backstory, only if the group really values this type of colour and theme based content.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 4 (Fight!)<br/>\nRoll initiatives and get your game on.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 5 (GM plans to plan)<br/>\nGM takes notes of any content contributed by players, and attempts to incorporate it in the next monster challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
