Scott's example is a situation where Wizards and a third party may release products with similar ideas at different times.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.enworld.org/showpost.php?p=4172942&amp;postcount=51" rel="nofollow">http://www.enworld.org/showpost.php?p=4172942&amp;postcount=51</a><br/><br/>There are also now strong indications that the license will be written so that the choice to use 3E OGL or 4E GSL will not be a product by product choice buy a company by company choice. Their licensing manager even insinuated (not confirmed) that you won't be able to reprint and sell your old 3E products if you go with the 4E GSL.<br/><br/>Questions remaining so far:<br/><br/>- if you go 4E, what is the mechanism to prevent use of 3E?<br/>- if you go 4E, can you return to 3E and simply never use 4E again?<br/>- if you go 4E, can you continue to sell old OGL products so long as you do not create new ones? What about reprinting old OGL products?

Several high ranking employees at Wizards have confirmed the intent of said license several times and have been very explicit about their meaning. Clear and reinforced intent matters. Otherwise they wouldn't even bother to post any information of this manner publicly.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Said license has not been finalized. Now is exactly the perfect time to raise complaints. It doesn't matter if what we're complaining about is even true (which it is so far, but even if it wasn't, it still wouldn't matter). All that matters is that people's opinions about various courses of actions are heard as they very much do impact the final decisions that are made. Believe me, there was a huge chance there would be no GSL at all but things keep changing based on their customer bases reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Many of the people "freaking out" and having "fan-niptions" in the above threads are owners of large companies whose businesses are impacted by these decisions. Many of the other people reacting are employees or freelancers of these companies. Many other people are very passionate long time customers who have spent thousands of dollars on said products. I want to hear all of their opinions. And if these opinions are aimed at the hypothetical, then awesome. Better now before the hypothetical becomes concrete.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140595/#Comment_140595" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-20T19:59:43+00:00" title="April 20, 2008  7:59PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2008 8:00PM by Eric.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Let's not freak out and have fan-niptions over some license that no one has read.</blockquote>\nYou make an excellent point.

Overall, the company still continues to do things in a more traditional fashion, doing "what's best for the company" instead of being satisfied with doing "what's best for the industry / community" and being a part of the general success that brings to the entire environment.  I suspect Wizards, like many folks, is trying to make a play that is both "daring" and relatively "safe," which lands them in this mess of being sorta open source, but not really, because they're not really prepared, as a company, to operate and compete in a truly open source environment, because, like most folks, they're still not entirely sure what that environment would look like.  Still, the post-IP all-Open horizon is slowly approaching and roleplaying seems uniquely poised, in many ways, to take advantage of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140691/#Comment_140691" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T12:19:39+00:00" title="April 21, 2008 12:19PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I slay the dragon, but not really.

Otherwise they would have just discontinued the process. Their behavior suggests they just don't understand or trust that a more open market raises everyones boat. This proposed maneuver seems really reminiscent of White Wolfs attempt to shut down other Larp organizations several years ago. This just seems like business folks who haven't groked that you can't benefit from a fairly open market, and control it all at the same time. Those other companies don't work for you, they work for a chance to see a profit. Those companies satisfying smaller niches than your large organization can helps your bottom line. Trying to force someone who has brought about a lot of sales of your books like say Green Ronin, or Paizo to become your supplicant, is the same as trying to shut down a LARP organization that has helped sell a lot of your products. It just doesn't make sense. <br/><br/>Top that off with the loss of trustworthiness in your companies intentions to be a good Shepard for the market it's trying to benefit from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140793/#Comment_140793" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T07:31:53+00:00" title="April 22, 2008  7:31AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless, of course, they've reviewed the market data they have access to and concluded two different things.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) D20 type support material that is directly compatible and effectively supports D&amp;D helps sell and market D&amp;D.

Assuming my understanding of what the new license will do is correct (and I recognize that is a big assumption at this point), it seems utterly clear to me that they are trying to allow and encourage third-party companies to create additional supplemental material for their game, but they do not want people to make alternative and essentially independent games.<br/><br/>I, for one, will be very interested in how this plays out, particularly with the regard to the vague reference to a non-D&amp;D d20 license coming later.

On top of this, they've announced a separate license for people who want to make those kinds of games based off 4e.<br/><br/>I'll agree with your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> point, though. I think it's obvious that WotC is trying to prevent some of the problems of 3.0's era, e.g., other companies releasing books that claimed they were "core," and/or went to market before the comparable WotC product (WW, guilty on both counts). They also seem (rightfully) to want to separate those products which are for use with 4e, and those that are simply based off d20.<br/><br/>I dunno. I'm not a publisher, so my opinion is probably not worth a whole lot. But I figure that, if you're gonna hitch your company to WotC's wagon, you gotta go where they go.

Going to hitch a ride on the WOTC game system, you have to do it the WOTC way. And corporate animals such as WOTC have turn over at key positions, so you just had to know they would eventually try and close off the OGL to some extent because some suit would eventually get in charge who simply didn't understand it or held a different corporate philisophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

In short, from Joe Goodman, WotC is not interested in destroying the non-3.5 OGL games in the market; they want M&amp;M, True20, C&amp;C, etc. to continue, and they especially do not want to hamper other systems released under the OGL that are completely unrelated to D&amp;D/d20 (Fudge, Action!, SotC, etc.). What they DO want from the GSL is a clear distinction of support for the new edition over the older one, which is just sound business sense, regardless of how one may feel about it. The GSL has not been released yet, few have seen the language of the license at the moment, and the rumors are based on things said in unofficial channels (I have my personal speculations about what may have happened since the Rouse posted his comments here last week, but I'll keep those to myself for now). There is still work to be done in that license in order to properly define what constitutes a product that is supported by the GSL, what constitutes a product not supported (and possibly rejected) by the GSL, the interaction of the GSL and the OGL, and what constitutes a product not affected at all by the GSL even though it may use the OGL. This seminar was recorded by Pulp Gamer and will be available in the near future. I also recorded some thoughts right after the seminar which I'll be releasing to my podcast soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141737/#Comment_141737" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T11:14:03+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 11:14AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2008 11:15AM by lachek.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><a href="http://www.networkperformancedaily.com/2008/04/mysql_isnt_going_from_open_to.html" rel="nofollow">Network Performance Daily</a>on this from an OSS point of view, looking at it as a troubling precedent.</blockquote>\nBoy, that was weird.

Reposted here:<br/><br/>Q. Does the so-called "poison pill" non-compete clause apply to ALL OGL, or only D&amp;D-based fantasy? (i.e. what if it's based on d20 Modern, d20 Future, or a non-d20 source?)<br/><br/>A. It\u2019s not a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d It\u2019s a conversion clause. The D&amp;D 4E GSL applies to fantasy-based products. The d20 GSL, which will come out at an undetermined point in the near future, will be for non-fantasy genres such as Modern, Future, etc. Publishers will be able to decide on a product line by product line basis which license will work best for them.<br/><br/>Q. Does the GSL contain provisions to prevent a secondary, sister or subsidiary company being created in order to distribute products under the OGL?<br/><br/>A. There are no restrictions prohibiting the formation of partnerships or subsidiaries, however companies will be bound by the product line declaration under the Game System License. <br/><br/>Q. How much of WotC's IP is made available via the GSL? Creatures such as beholders and illithids were not available under the old licensing structure. Will they be available under the new structure?<br/><br/>A. All of those details will be released when the license becomes available on June 6. <br/><br/>Q. What products would WotC like to see come out of the third party publishers that they are not currently interested in producing themselves?<br/><br/>A. The easy answer is we want to see quality products that support 4th Edition D&amp;D. I\u2019m guessing you want specific examples, right? The GSL is designed for publishers to make Adventures, \u201cFluff,\u201d Campaign settings, Alternate Classes, Races, Monsters, Paragon Paths, Epic Destinies, and other creative supplemental products. <br/><br/>Q. What are WotC\u2019s main goals regarding the GSL? Do you believe that third-party products will drive sales of the D&amp;D core rulebooks? <br/><br/>A. The goals with the GSL include supporting our product line, growing the industry, and supplying consumers with a rich offering of RPG products meant to be used with the 4th Edition of D&amp;D . And, of course, we want to drive sales of the D&amp;D core rulebooks.<br/><br/>On behalf of Russell Morrissey and all of EN World, thank you for the opportunity to hold this interview. <br/><br/>Q) Many questions have been raised since the announcement last week. I think the one question everyone wants to know is: is the limitation the GSL places on publication of OGL based products limited on a "per company" basis or a "per product" basis? That is, is the effect merely to limit re-issuing the same product, or is a company that publishes a GSL product thereafter limited in their ability to publish any OGL products?<br/><br/>A. The restriction is on a per product line basis.<br/><br/>Q) How does this pertain to a company's catalog of existing OGL-based products? For example, if Necromancer Games publishes a Tome of Horrors 4e, would they have to stop selling their existing 3e OGL products via RPGnow?<br/><br/>A. Publishers will be able to continue to sell their backlist under the OGL. If those products had the d20 system logo on them there will be a 6-month sell off period after which they will not be able to use the d20 system logo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142099/#Comment_142099" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T15:33:26+00:00" title="May  2, 2008  3:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continued:<br/><br/>Q) Can existing OGL products be updated to the GSL and what are the restrictions, if any?<br/><br/>A. Existing OGL products can absolutely be converted to 4e GSL products, so long as they adhere to the terms of the GSL. In fact, we want to see publishers update their popular product lines to 4e.<br/><br/>Q) What branding opportunities does the GSL offer publishers? Does it allow use of the new d20 logo; or does it allow access to Dungeons &amp; Dragons specific branding?<br/><br/>A. There will be a compatibility logo. Embedded in this logo is a version of the new D&amp;D logo and copy stating compatibility. This compatibility logo is permissible for use on product and marketing materials. There will be restrictions on placement and maximum size allowed. <br/><br/>Q) A six-month "sell-off" period has been mentioned with reference to stock carrying the old d20 logo. Is the d20 STL actually going away, or does this sell-off period apply only to those who adopt the GSL?<br/><br/>A. The d20 STL will be terminated. There will be a sell-off period of six months for products produced under the d20 STL. This is true for both pdf and print products. We\u2019re estimating our own backlist stock to be sold through within 3 to 4 months, so allowing six months to other publishers feels fair. Allowing 6 months for pdfs is really pretty generous and we are already in conversations with publishers and PDF sellers like DrivethruRPG.com and RPGNow on how they can make these changes as easy as possible.<br/><br/>Q) Is the new GSL an open license? <br/><br/>A. We are not classifying the GSL as \u201copen\u201d as defined under the open source movement. It is a royalty-free license for permissible usage of specific D&amp;D 4th Edition content including terms, tables, and templates. There is a significant amount of \u201copenness\u201d to the license and we wanted to provide ease of use and low barriers to entry while still maintaining control over things like the D&amp;D Trademark. The GSL is designed to work with the 4th Edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. <br/><br/>Q) Is WotC planning on providing an easily available, downloadable copy of the rules available both online and off without a fee?<br/><br/>A. No. Anyone wishing access to the rules will need to purchase the core rulebooks. The GSL SRD will have a list of the terms, tables, and templates available for use under the GSL and will be available for download at no charge with the GSL itself.<br/><br/>Q) Are there any "types" of product prohibited by the GSL? For example, the old d20 STL prohibited the inclusion of character generation or advancement, meaning that a standalone game could not be created, while the OGL alone did not. Does the GSL contain these restrictions? Are any other types of product restricted?<br/><br/>A. Most of what was in the d20 STL has been pulled into the GSL. For example, no product can describe a process for creating a character or applying the effects of experience to a character. The new license is meant to work with the core D&amp;D rules. The final details will be announced when the license is released in June. <br/><br/>Q) Are products required to adhere to any 'community standards' clause, or anything similar? <br/><br/>A.. Yes. The community standards that were in the d20 STL are now wrapped up into the GSL\u2019s.<br/><br/>Q) Is the GSL a perpetual license, or is it revocable by WotC for reasons other than violation?<br/><br/>A. The Game System License Is revocable as it is tied to the D&amp;D trademark and other intellectual property. Because of this Wizards needs to maintain control of the license. <br/><br/>Q) Why is October 1st the selected date for release of third-party materials, as opposed to, say, GenCon, which would be a far more useful launch date?<br/><br/>A. Our initial intention was to have third-party materials ready for release at GenCon, however there is no way that anyone could develop a true quality product in the short time between now and GenCon. We think that October 1st is more reasonable, and will also allow publishers to take advantage of holiday sales. <br/><br/>Q) Will any third-party publishers be permitted to release product under the GSL prior to October 1st?<br/><br/>A. No. October 1st is the permissible on-sale date for all third party publishers.<br/><br/>Q) Is there anything that you wished we\u2019d asked that we haven\u2019t?<br/><br/>A. You didn\u2019t ask about my 4E character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142146/#Comment_142146" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-03T02:58:29+00:00" title="May  3, 2008  2:58AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just like planned: no OGL, only d20, with a different name and stricter conditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142152/#Comment_142152" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-03T07:45:41+00:00" title="May  3, 2008  7:45AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2008 7:47AM by James_Nostack.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you guys serious?

What you'd like to do is create a discrete, intelligent, non-FUD-filled atmosphere so that everyone feels like their needs matter to the other side.  You bounce several drafts around, and once all the big players are happy, <i>then</i> you announce it to the public.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternately: you come up with really simple, clear, licensing terms that are industry-standard, and maybe you tweak a little bit -- you can do this entirely in private, and then publicize it; getting people's input isn't so important here because it's what they're used to.  (I doubt this model works very well for RPG's, though, and even to the extent that the OGL/d20 license conditioned people to a certain way of industry behavior, the 4e license is meant to deliberately break with those customs.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of the material terms of this license, the <i>way</i> Wizards has gone about it looks extremely haphazard and kind of discourteous, and must be destroying a lot of goodwill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Why doesn't Wizards like their face? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6349/why-doesnt-wizards-like-their-face/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Why doesn't Wizards like their face? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6349/why-doesnt-wizards-like-their-face/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="No argument from me, James.

Since the license was released so late, they ditched the $5,000 fee, but just lumped everyone into the "Wait until October" category.<br/><br/>I dunno. I can't really get angry about any of this.

In my opinion, the OGL provided a legal framework to allow roleplayers to do what roleplayers had already been doing since before the first version of D&amp;D was published: borrow and remix game mechanics for their own play and, also, for creating competing commercial products.  From that perspective, if licenses become significantly less open, they actually restrict widely accepted existing practices and are not necessary a big gift that we should be thankful WotC is bestowing upon us.  The free borrowing practices of roleplaying are already decades ahead of many other creative fields in establishing an open creative environment.

But, on the other hand, I think WotC being less open about their IP is likely to have a strong effect.  In fact, I would argue that the backlash against the perceived weaknesses and problems of open gaming started a while back.<br/><br/>Remember <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/67263.html" rel="nofollow">the John Kim vs. Green Ronin fiasco</a> over posting the open portions of Blue Rose on the internet, as a kind of SRD?  To me, that indicated that Green Ronin was not actively on board with many of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" rel="nofollow">the core principles of open source</a>, despite their own use of open content.  In contrast, Evil Hat enthusiastically welcomed efforts by their own fans to make <a href="http://zork.net/~nick/loyhargil/fate3/fate3.html" rel="nofollow">an SRD for Spirit of the Century</a>. Recently, Green Ronin have taken <a href="http://true20.com/licensing/" rel="nofollow">a more pro-open stance</a> with their True20 material, but I suspect this is -- at least in part -- motivated by an attempt to build a foundation for True20 when it looked like WotC was putting a firmer grip on their own IP.  They're still <a href="http://true20.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=571&amp;sid=0375158b1eb4538469dae93af74b84e9" rel="nofollow">actively dissuading attempts at a True20 SRD</a>.<br/><br/>So, from my perspective, a shift in thinking about open content and the value of it has already happened in the minds of several major roleplaying publishers.  The changes to WotC's open content procedures are really an indication of these developments more than something entirely new.  But I would argue that <i>something is wrong</i> when roleplaying publishers increasingly feel the need to prevent their fans or fellow publishers from "unfairly" taking advantage of their work.  Legitimately protecting your IP from damaging, unfair practices is one thing, but protecting a specific business model or method of operating is another, and I think the latter is actually happening more often.  The way open source generally works as a commercial business model is that you give away some open content (Linux, webcomics, SRDs) and make your money selling content that isn't open or freely available (support, t-shirts, hardcover books with full color art).  But WotC and Green Ronin clearly want to have their cake and eat it too; they want people to spend money for the privilege of having access to open content (via print or PDF versions, or both).  That's pretty odd, yeah?<br/><br/>But, honestly, that's how most publishing works under the OGL.  Do OGL publishers put their open content on their website, for people to use?  Nope, not generally.  Sometimes they make PDFs of their products free after they've sold about as many as they play to, but that's it.  And now they have even less of an incentive to make open content really open and available, with major publishers taking pains to put more barriers around content that's supposed to be free to use.  I imagine a widespread turtling is not far off, with a large number of folks retreating into their shells instead of being coaxed into abandoning them entirely.  Is there a future in which you can play D&amp;D for free (i.e. the corebooks can be freely downloaded), but have to pay for "official" supplements compiled by WotC from both fan and freelancer material (and made all pretty)?  Maybe, but it just moved a bit further off, since WotC (and others) have decided that this open stuff isn't as awesome as they thought it was and, instead of getting more open (and, generally speaking, roleplaying's barely open at all, yet), we're going back to being more closed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142536/#Comment_142536" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T18:12:37+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  6:12PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Remember the John Kim vs. Green Ronin fiasco over posting the open portions of Blue Rose on the internet, as a kind of SRD?

Has anyone ever replicated this?  As I understand it, the basic idea with all this "open gaming" stuff is that a zillion people get to work on the problem of, say, "hit points," and somewhere in that distributive intelligence, a really sweet solution emerges, and the various systems evolve in parallel, and eventually there's either a replacement or a fork.

And since those RPGs are released under the OGL, they don't really *need* a new license.<br/><br/>I think that the second license will be a lot more open and OGL-like. WotC obviously just wants to make sure that the D&amp;D brand is protected this time around, ergo, it gets its own license, while general d20 gets another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142609/#Comment_142609" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T07:06:34+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  7:06AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>Been thinking about this one recently myself, a fair bit.

WotC (and Green Ronin, and...) have *full time employees*. That alone makes them very different beasts than the indie publishers. Clinton can give TSOY away for free because *he has a day job.* You ask, e.g.,  Steve Long of Hero Games about going OGL with HERO (which comes up all the time on their boards), and he will look at you like you're crazy, rightfully so. You're basically asking him to give away their primary source of revenue.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong... I loved the initial d20 boom. I love many of the RPGs that were born out of it. Of course, I ended up selling most of the third-party d20 stuff I bought, and the remainder has largely sat on my shelf un-played. Like me (stretching a metaphor here, be kind), I think WotC realized that while going open was valuable, there was a limit to that value. At a certain point, it just became a lot of crap crowding the shelves.<br/><br/>So, this time around, they're trying to maximize their license's usefulness to their bottom line.

But RPGs are a shrinking industry and have been for some time, partially because -- so I suspect -- the traditional business model doesn't really work.  So, yeah, I don't blame them (or Green Ronin, etc.) for hedging their bets, but I do think it's a shame that no one has a business model that's really based on the idea of open content.  Instead, everyone seems to be satisfied with selling access to supposedly open content, which isn't all that different from selling closed content.  It's certainly more familiar, so it's clear why they're going that route, but I don't think it's going to do anything to "save" roleplaying, because I think that business model is ultimately doomed.  But if they want to make money on the way out, that's fine.  It just means they have increasingly less and less to contribute to the future of the hobby, which I don't think involves closed content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142634/#Comment_142634" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T09:04:14+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  9:04AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

WOTC during it's development cycles started figuring out what makes a good spell, a good feat, a good class- but all of that important information was kept in house.  Everyone else had to basically reverse engineer these ideas from play, and it took several years before folks had grasped the concepts with them.  For comparison, videogame consoles try to get the developer's kit into people's hands as soon as possible, and try to encourage giving developers enough basic info to get up to speed towards making good product ASAP.<br><br/>In terms of current rpg "open source" stuff, as you mentioned, and Mike Mearls also, when everyone's open source costs money to access, it loses the value of being an easy access to innovative ideas to be turned over and over quickly.<br/><br/>In fact, the indie game design community does a better job of "open sourcing" because generally if someone copies or builds off an idea, it's not immediately freaked as a threat to business revenue, while most OGL folks generally made their BEST material closed source and the weaksauce the OGL stuff.<br/><br/>I don't think the traditional business model is completely doomed, but I think it needs a big shift towards evergreen products instead of supplement treadmill, and looking at a better way of interfacing with the customer &amp; player base, and most importantly, if it's at all concerned with outreach, building gateways to get people in, because the "know somebody" kind of method is great for hobbies, terrible for business.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142688/#Comment_142688" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T12:25:09+00:00" title="May  6, 2008 12:25PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2008 12:25PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>You ask, e.g., Steve Long of Hero Games about going OGL with HERO (which comes up all the time on their boards), and he will look at you like you're crazy, rightfully so.

In the meantime all the sales of Vampire/Werewolf/Changeling T-Shirts, Dice, Coffee mugs, board games, computer games, comic books, clan novels, clan books full of fiction and setting (IP and thus not open source) would be all theirs. <br/><br/>I honest to god don't think that WW is making most of its money off its rules. (Note, not saying here "not off books" -- I think books probably still make them the most money, but I don't think it is the Storyteller system that is driving most of the sales other than in its community of practice network system, which might be increased by open sourcing.) I think their fictional/world/theme IP stuff is far more valuable and open sourcing could get more people into it, and make their play more what the community (or sub-aspects of the community) are specifically looking for. <br/><br/>Hero Games, otoh, is a company that is selling rules and might have a harder time doing the same thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142725/#Comment_142725" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T14:27:14+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  2:27PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, also, though I know NOTHING about details -- I have to wonder how Wick's Houses of the Blooded is going to play into this discussion. <br/><br/>Right now if you preorder the fancy book you get a CD full of stuff to make your own Houses material -- fonts, templates, etc. In time there is going to be an online peer-review community to decide what fan stuff becomes canon and so on. <br/><br/>This seems like an interesting way with a lot of potential to use a limited sourcing and peer network to expand a game while returning profit and attention to the source.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142727/#Comment_142727" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T14:30:19+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  2:30PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2008 2:33PM by J_Walton.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, I don't want to go all Web 2.0 on you, but see if these help.

That's kinda like what's happening with open content in gaming right now, because WotC, the market leader, decided it liked this open content idea and started implementing it from the top-down when it's really meant to happen from the bottom-up.<br/><br/>The general principle, as far as I understand it, is that open content is intended to be collaboratively created by a bunch of individuals freely contributing a small portion of their time, like with Wikipedia.  They don't expect to make money back on their creation.  However, when companies invest in open content, things get weird, right, because they have to pay their employees.  In some cases, like with software, companies invest in open content projects because they generate a lot of material really quickly (like the initial d20 glut) and, if you can harvest it or find a way to distill out only the good stuff, the investing company also gets to make legal use of all that open material themselves, potentially in commercial products.  If you look at True20 Revised, where Steve Kenson drew on a crapload of other material, you can see that this does sometimes happen.<br/><br/>But this is not what WotC did.  They'd didn't gather bunches of terrific open material and publish them in beautifully illustrated hardcovers to make themselves a bunch of money without having to pay the writers.  In fact, with the relatively low cost of freelancing in roleplaying, it would probably be more expensive for them to pay folks to troll through the bad OGL content looking for usable stuff to adapt into commercial products.  Instead, there are only two print books that I know of that simply reprint previously published open content... The Year's Best D20 (Green Ronin) and Unearthed Arcana (WotC), the latter of which also has a bunch of new material.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't have a really clear idea of what the OGL / GSL does for WotC, and I don't think they really know either.  They certainly haven't released a clear plan for making open content work for them.  Hopefully (for them), they're in the process of creating one.<br/><br/>P.S. Totally agreed with Brand on how WW could still make a crapload of money (maybe even more money) if the WoD corebook was free and open.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142753/#Comment_142753" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T16:59:26+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  4:59PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2008 5:01PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>In what other ways could one generate revenue from sharing IP?</blockquote>\nWell, let's look at the basic models:<br/><br/><b>Free + Ads:</b> A free service that makes it's revenues by advertising.  Many forums and magazines have gone this way, some with success, some without.<br/><br/><b>Freemium:</b> A free product with an enhanced, "closed" version.  This is one of the functions an SRD could actually serve - to be the "lite" version people can play with, but less valuable because it doesn't contain setting-specific details, art, or some example text.  Many web services run this way, including many "free MMOs" that <i>are making money</i>.<br/><br/><b>Cost-comparison licensing:</b> imagine if the OGL said "non-commercial", and the OGL Upgrade said "commercial", but you had to pay a small fee to make use of the Upgrade - and that the company making the lisence spent time "filtering" the free crap along with the user base, and encouraging only the best free people to go for the upgrade.<br/><br/><b>Patronage Services:</b> Say you offer a webzine, free, but patrons get it early, and get enhanced dodads on the site, as well as clear and preferential treatment, becuse they are patrons.<br/><br/><b>Officialisation:</b> What you sell is a dressed up version of free product, as with freemium, but the dressed-up stuff is <i>fan-created.</i>  They get a nominal payment, but much more importantly get recognition.  This need not be combined with an actual license, I note.<br/><br/>...There are more.  Many more.  Thing is, these are all in development right now in other industries; to make them work here, we need to look at successes that are similar, or failures that are informative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142776/#Comment_142776" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T21:28:54+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  9:28PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that post, Levi.
