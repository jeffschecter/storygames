We utilised the art from the classic Starblazer comics to bring the game to life and there's a ton of setting material presented in a format you can use or dismantle to produce the game you want. We've also got a free 40 page preview if you want to check out the some of the rules and content. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd really like to know what people think so please fire off any comments here on on the Cubicle 7 forum                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
