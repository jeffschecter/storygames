I will come up with a rough set of events to involve the players in and then find out what they do. I think the worst/best example of this was a game where the players were looking for someone in a midevilish style city and they deduced that this person was in the palace. They were right of course and most of the game consisted of them trying to break into the palace. This took two sessions so I had plenty of time to prepare but I still winged it. They finally got into the palace and I did not have a map of the interior. What's more I didn't even have an idea of what it would look like. Now this is why I have this bad habit. I proceeded to draw all five overlapping levels of the palace as the players explored it. One of my players talks about it to this day.<br/><br/>So that's my sharing now to the question. I would like to hear what works for you when you're setting up a game. What do you need to feel you're ready? If you wing it like me, have there been times this has let you down? <br/><br/>I'm not looking for if something is right or wrong, just if it works.<br/><br/>I also realize this may have come up as a thread before. I looked but didn't see it. If you know the thread, point it out and then let us know if anything has changed for you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383973/#Comment_383973" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T09:55:23+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  9:55AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite is adopting a set of game rules with a clear, well-defined and unambitious prep procedure and following it verbatim.

A situation where you felt "That could have gone better"? I know I've had that kind of situation, usually were I could easily have had an NPC more clearly defined in my mind and I'm suddenly not sure of how to portray that NPC in an unbiased way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383978/#Comment_383978" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T11:34:03+00:00" title="June 30, 2012 11:34AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes I feel like I've lost track of critical information -- "What was the name of that research station again?" -- but most of the time, we just handwave it away. One of the players will be like, I think we killed this dude a few months ago, and another player will say, yeah... we *thought* we did. Clearly, he had a Resurrection Stone with him. And off we go.<br/><br/>I do a lot of questioning of my players. "Wait, what's this guy's deal? Is he a hooker with a heart of gold, or just a jaded hustler looking for another john to con?" And they tell me what we're up to. They're the type of players who actively seek out conflict and disdain advantage, so they're always coming up with great deathtraps/arguments/dilemmas for me. They do a lot of my work, actually.<br/><br/>At con games, my approach doesn't always work, because sometimes I game with people who expect the GM to have all this stuff written and prepped beforehand. Which I get. But I just don't like the way it feels. To me, all games are sandbox, and playing any other way feels very strange. It always bewilders me when GMs say, I didn't think you were going to do that, or I figured you guys would get the message when that NPC did this or that -- to my way of thinking, it's more fun to push complicated traps (social, personal, physical, intellectual) in front of the players and then see what they do. Like I said, at con games (or games with new people), the results are mixed: some dig it, and some get annoyed when they ask what's behind the door and I reply, "It's a gruesome crime scene. What's written in blood on the wall?" They want me to tell them, not the other way around.

A lot, but mostly easy and fun stuff: thinking about the NPCs, getting their voices nailed down in my head, thinking about what they want and what they'd do to get it, thinking about how those wants are going to bring them into conflict with the player characters, thinking about locations where stuff could happen and how to make those locations more interesting, and so on. By the time the weekend rolls around, I've logged a lot of time putting together raw material for the game. I've got a little notebook that I write good ideas down in, and I go back to look them over and see how I can improve them, and that notebook's pretty much the spine of whatever game I'm running.<br/><br/>Then I sit down to do the "boring" stuff. I think about what I'm not good at making up in the moment, like names and maps (ugh, but some of our group loves 'em), and I grind 'em out and put them in my notes so that when I need a name, I can just pick one off a list. I think about stuff that players will find useful, like cheat sheets, and prep and print those. I put together stats for the NPCs and stick 'em in my notes. If it's a game with a more involved combat system (ie, D&amp;D), I make sure that all the relevant rules for various opponents' combat powers are on the same page as their combat stats, so I'm not flipping back and forth in a book.<br/><br/>If I do the "boring" stuff right, then most of the time I'm done within an hour, or two at the very most. And to be fair, it's not exactly boring -- it's just something I can't do in idle moments during the day. I have to actually block out some time, sit down, and do the work. That hour or so spent ahead of time makes the game run more smoothly, which subjectively feels like it's saving me a thousand years of agony in every game session. It's a fair trade.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383981/#Comment_383981" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T13:18:35+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  1:18PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2012 1:19PM by James_Mullen.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I sharpen pencils. </blockquote>\nThis.

At least, that's what would bother me in that situation.<br/><br/>If they signed up for an investigative game or you've been setting up an investigative story, it's a total bait-and-switch to turn around and make it a game where they invent a mystery rather than investigate one. In an investigative game, you're supposed to be the one telling them what's written on the wall, and it's entirely fair for them to expect that you will.<br/><br/>...of course, my understanding of how con games usually work is that most of the people who sign up for games don't really pay attention to what the game will be about, so all the advance warnings in the world about how you're going to make them invent the clues for the mystery probably won't help. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383999/#Comment_383999" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T17:55:20+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  5:55PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">@AccountingForTaste</a><br/><br/>No right or wrong here, just whatever works for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384004/#Comment_384004" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T18:38:23+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  6:38PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2012 6:40PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Onix">@Onix</a><br/><br/>Well, sure, but what works for you should also work for the rest of the table.

It's only happened a couple of times, and I've been GMing con games for about a decade. Most of the time, people are really enthusiastic about it. More spotlight time for them, less time spent listening to a DM. The only reason I mentioned it was, Onix asked if it had ever failed me at some point. But for the most part, it works like a charm. I've found that most players <i>want</i> to get in on the action, to some degree.\n<blockquote>You had me at beer.</blockquote>\nYeah, it's a beautiful thing. I love running games at my house so I can knock back a couple cold ones. By 10 or 11, when things are heating up and the Grand Guignol is rearing its ugly head, I'm feeling the joy.\n<blockquote>Also, if it's a game with lots of dice or dice pools, then I make some origami boxes out of paper to hold them all in, so they don't start out spread all over the table. A lot of my GMing gets done on some pretty small tables in a dark corner of the bar at Naish holiday village, so dice get lost easily. :-) </blockquote>\nThat is just <i>beautiful</i>. I use board game box tops for dice-rolling enclosures. Just lift the top off your scrabble game and off you go. But origami? That's... Okay, I have a new goal for the summer.

When running story games I just try to learn the rules in advance. With my freeform con games I tend to prep a lot. I create PCs and NPCs and places and past events and secrets and try to imagine what the players would do next and what will follow. Of course they're going to do something unexpected at some point, so my improvisation skills still come handy. I guess it's like what you do before writing a book or a script: you've got the plot and the characters down, and you know that this cool scene is going to be in there somewhere, but you don't know exactly what's going to happen until you write/GM it.<br/><br/>What's curious is that even if I plan my games in detail (check out Wikipedia for locations and dates, etc), I don't write it down. Even if I scribble down some names or notes, I end up not looking anything up. Loving names helps in this: I have understood that GMs in general have a problem inventing or remembering names. Personally I have hard time remembering exactly how rules work, especially rules I'm not that interested in. <br/><br/>When I've tried to run campaigns I always plan several sessions ahead so that everything is foreshadowed well in advance. <br/><br/>I'd say that if you don't want to prep anything else, decide a tone and try to stick with it, and try to get inspired before the game, by music or fiction or whatever.

I get a lot of props which look like clues, I think about some possible set pieces, I react to what the players do. It's pretty light in terms of writing down any prep. I might get a list of names. After the first session I build what has happened into the semblance of a plot, adjusting as I go along. I do ask for player input on what they see, but I tailor it to the group.

Considering past adventures and which established, significant NPCs and items might be fun to see again.<br/><br/>2 and 3. Create a loose plot to include those.  This naturally leads to deciding upon a setting.<br/><br/>4. Look at my <a href="http://davidvs.net/name/design.shtml#Maps" rel="nofollow">acrostic of old school adventure elements</a>.  They help me flush out the upcoming story.<br/><br/>5. Make NPC names, sketch a map if appropriate, etc.<br/><br/><b>Here is my current example.</b><br/><br/>1. I wanted to have the next chapter in the story include a powerful but perhaps benevolent Ogre alchemist that my wife's character has briefly met before.  I also want the adventure to be in the large town in which the PC just arrived.<br/><br/>2 and 3. Her character is a novice alchemist.  OOC she said her character would be willing to accept a job from the Ogre with a new alchemy recipe as payment.  I have a Paizo Flip-Mat of a waterfront inn I have been wanting to use.  Let's have the job be stopping another Ogre from framing and killing someone in the tavern.  (Ogres can look like anyone they touch.  A bit of mystery, a bit of combat.)<br/><br/>4. My acrostic helps me brainstorm more events in an otherwise tiny adventure.  A crazy Unseemly nature-worshiper attacks the inn with his pet giant crab.  A hunter who has recently returned from a magical Wild Hunt shows his drinking buddies a creepy statue he found.  Two drunks in the tavern harbor an old feud, which one escalates by using a recently acquired enchanted mug that creates a Beer Golem to attack his foe.  The enemy Ogre is not acting alone: he has a partner hidden in the tavern's crowd, and the local noble who hired the Ogre to frame and kill a rival noble is also disguised and watching.<br/><br/>5. Make up names for all those NPCs, sketch a map since it's hard to take the Flip-Mat on a walk if this ends up another on-a-walk adventure, etc.<br/><br/><b>What happens?</b><br/><br/>This routine results in mini-adventures that are non-linear but easy to GM because they are fairly predictable.  That's what my wife likes, and it works well when we can't devote 100% of our attention to the game.  Although her PC's choices have little affect on <i>what events happen</i> during the adventure, they hugely affect <i>how events are resolved</i> and therefore <i>what material I will have to work with</i> when creating the next chapter of the story.<br/><br/>Will the PC foil the assassination?  What will her relationship with the innkeeper and tavern staff be like at the end of the adventure?  Will the noble who hired the assassin learn enough about the PC to become a long-term enemy?  Will the hunter become a recurring NPC?  Will either drunk (or his family) gain gratitude or hatred of the PC?  Will the PC feel included to stay in this town or move on?  Etc.<br/><br/>Also, I improvise all the personalities of new NPCs.  So even a "scripted" event might happen in many ways based upon what mood my wife seems to be in and what she is enjoying having her PC do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384141/#Comment_384141" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-02T15:14:28+00:00" title="July  2, 2012  3:14PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2012 3:15PM by Upstart.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sure you are, a sandboxer sets up the setting which includes places and people.

A GM can prep stuff in a sandbox game, but it's possible that none of that stuff gets into play. <br/><br/>I guess this is tangential, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384209/#Comment_384209" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T09:44:23+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  9:44AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.canonpuncture.com/?p=2072" rel="nofollow">Shameless</a> self promotion.<br/>In this episode, I rattle off pretty much everything I do (as a GM) in weekly games to prep things.<br/><br/>Conventions?<br/>I build characters that are pointed at each other and make handouts to explain the big important parts of the games.<br/>Or, if world building is part of the game, I make sure to bring an idea to grind up against player input just in case.<br/><br/>The short answer for me is the same thing everyone else said to me from the beginning.
