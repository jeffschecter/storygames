And we all wanted to play with each other. <br/><br/>So Tim and I created the Gotham Gaming Guild. The idea was that we would take our 3 very large gaming groups, mix up all the players and GMs, rents space in Manhattan, and create 4 different new gaming groups that would play every other Friday night for 6 sessions. <br/><br/>It was a huge success. We started doing it twice a year and today will be our 10th season! <br/><br/>Over the 5 years the group fluctuated between 20-50 people. Many new people joined up. Became friends. And formed new gaming groups outside of the GGG. The more successful we became at bringing people together, the less reason people needed the GGG. Which was a good thing! Today we have a batch of 36 players. Many new to each other. I'm excited to make new friends and bring new people together.<br/><br/>There was 1 GGG where we played almost exclusively indie games. Alexander once ran an Indie sampler where every session was a different indie game (My Life With Master, Dogs, Kill Puppies for Satan...). I played PTA and With Great Power for the first time at the GGG.<br/><br/>Recently GGG has become less indie and more of a mixture of different styles of game. Tonight we are playing: <br/><br/>Flash Gordon and the Warriors of Mongo (Fantastic Worlds)<br/>Vampire: the Dark Ages (World of Darkness)<br/>Prey (D&amp;D 3.5, Pathfinder)<br/>Sandbox in the Sargasso Sector (Traveller)<br/>the Century Club (Spirit of the Century!)<br/>Blackout! (my new game, based on The Five)<br/><br/>I'm excited!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230062/#Comment_230062" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T10:16:35+00:00" title="September  4, 2009 10:16AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm playing in John's game!

Questions they asked:<br/>\n<br/>\n- I want to play a magical elf but someone told me at level 1 you suck? Can I just play a cool magical elf?<br/>\n- How do you win?<br/>\n- Is it like a video game RPG but I have to fill out forms and do all the math myself?<br/>\n- Do you have to do homework to play?<br/>\n- How much do I have to read before I can play?<br/>\n- Do I have to wear a costume?<br/>\n- Is it like playing in a fantasy book world or is it like a boardgame?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230619/#Comment_230619" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T12:51:24+00:00" title="September  8, 2009 12:51PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2009 7:22AM by jenskot.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone asked me to explain what BLACKOUT is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn BLACKOUT you play normal people struggling to survive an alien invasion set in the 2003 NYC blackout. You will survive. But will you still be you when it\u2019s all over?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo play you need 1 set of double-six dominoes, 1 person to play the director and at least 2 people to play the survivors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe director answers the questions on the invasion sheet (10-20 minutes). The survivors answer the questions on their survivor sheets (10 minutes).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no numbers to divide and play with. You just describe who you want to play. The questions encourage you to describe normal every day people. You have to work but not live in Manhattan. You name people you love, hate, depend on, and depend on you in NYC. And finally we decide how the survivors know each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can randomly create an invasion or a survivor by drawing dominoes and picking suggestions from a list. The suggestions are time and location specific. For example, the suggested names are based on the top 10 popular male and female names among white, black, asian, and hispanic children in NYC in the 1990s.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe take turns playing short scenes to introduce our survivors and see who they were before the invasion starts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen on a hot and humid Thursday, August 14th, 2003 at 4:15pm\u2026 the invasion starts!<br/>\n<br/>\nEach survivor begins with 3 points. The director begins with 2 points per survivor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe director earns points by challenging the survivors, challenging what the survivors care about, winning challenges, losing challenges, and revealing the invasion in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe survivors earn points by winning challenges, losing challenges, putting themselves in danger, putting other survivors in danger, freaking out in front of other survivors, showing other survivors what they care about and why, sacrificing what they care about, and changing who they are by answering doubts.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach survivor sheet has a list of doubts. A few examples: something is growing inside me, I am being watching right now, telling the truth will hurt me, my thoughts are controlled by others, aliens are real, my friends will betray me, I will leave my friends and loved ones behind, I can\u2019t trust the government, I will break the law, people are not worth saving, I will kill. You can answer a doubt as true and then negatively rewrite a detail on your survivor sheet to reflect the change to earn points.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need points to win challenges. We play dominoes to determine who wins a challenge and how. You don\u2019t take turns attacking and defending. Only the aggressor gets to attack. If you want to attack back, you have to become the aggressor (playing doubles dominoes is one way, spending point is another). You can end up in a situation where one side is constantly attacking and the other side is constantly defending.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo defend you must match dominoes. If you can\u2019t match a domino you lose the challenge. You can\u2019t draw dominoes unless you spend points. Additionally, there is a list of effects that let you break the normal domino rules to help you win. Effects also cost points. There is a constant pressure to earn points. If you run out of points in a challenge, you don\u2019t have to lose. You can simply perform one of the many ways to earn more points. Like sacrificing something you care about. Or even giving up and losing the challenge! That earns your points as well. Lose now to win later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe director can spend points to inflict conditions on survivors in a challenge. Which means writing a brief phrase describing something bad that is happening to you. Conditions make it so you earn less points from winning challenges and earn more points for losing challenges (roleplaying a condition as the reason you lost a challenge).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe survivors decide when the game ends. When everyone answers one of these doubts: I will sacrifice myself, I will kill myself, I am a hero, I am a victim, and I am not human\u2026 the game ends!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it is all over, who your survivor is will look very different than who they were. In some cases, they may be unrecognizable. It would be funny to see a before and after survivor sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230620/#Comment_230620" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T12:52:02+00:00" title="September  8, 2009 12:52PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BLACKOUT feels like my favorite parts of Dread (Jenga), Dogs in the Vineyard, Prime Time Adventures, Mouse Guard, With Great Power, and D&amp;D; 4E mixed together and strained into a tasty mush of yum.

All the games have been fun but I need to streamline it, make sure the effect costs are balanced, and make sure everything we do at the table is actually reflected in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're going to wrap up our current game at the next GGG session. Then we will pick a new setting with similar themes and reskin the game to match them.
