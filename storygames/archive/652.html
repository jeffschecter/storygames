<p>Okay, so when we play we are all both actors and spectators, right?  Players do things and also observe other players doing things.</p>
<p>Now I've seen two broad divisions in terms of what people expect as an audience:  In some games, everything happens right there around the table, and people assume that they will get to see the whole shebang, from soup to nuts.</p>
<p>In some games, people go off into another room (often with the GM) and chat about stuff secretly.  Other participants, obviously, don't expect to be witness to that secret stuff (though sometimes it is assumed that the GM [b]must[/b] know, or that secrets must be temporary (i.e. that the other players will eventually find out what happened)).</p>
<p>So ... is this something inherent to what we're actually doing, or is it a holdover from linear media like storytelling and television?</p>
<p>Thought experiment:  Imagine you were watching a soap opera where thread of the story were being simultaneously followed on <em>ten television channels</em>.  When one thread weaved into another (i.e. Jessica storms out on Roland, but bumps into Edward filling in what looks suspiciously like a grave in the back garden) you get to choose which thread/channel to follow next.  But the broadcast is only happening this once, and you don't have ten VCRs, so you <strong>will not get to watch the whole thing</strong>.</p>
<p>That's ... it's totally unlike storytelling that I'm familiar with ... and yet ... and yet, it draws me.  I feel strongly that, for all that is lost ("But what did <strong>Roland</strong> when I went off following Jessica?  Where did he disappear to, and why are temporal clones of him returning from the future to destroy the past?  I <em>have to know!</em>") there would be some powerful things gained.</p>
<p>Similar thought experiment:  Imagine a game in which any two players could play, separately, without consulting other people.  You get together with the GM and do GM-stuff, then you wander off to the other room.  Bobby's there, so you play a scene between your characters.  Suddenly Jake storms in ... apparently he needs a scene with Bobby in the worst way.  So you head back to the GM and slide back into that scene.  When it's appropriate, you dump some of the resources you got playing with Bobby, and everyone says "Oh, you sly dog!  Have you been up to something?" but they all know that whatever it is, recapping it can and will wait until after the game is over.</p>
<p>I think that'd be cool.  D'you think that'd be cool?</p>

                            It's cool, but different.<br/>It results in a more "life-like" story, where you don't get all the details, you dig for what you get and it's coloured by someone's narrative.<br/><br/>RPGs currently tend to be more like books, where you usually get told everything. Just look at DragonLance or Wheel of Time. So parties split and you follow them all.<br/><br/>If you want to have/develop a coherent theme for your game then all that happens should be known.<br/><br/>In short: Everything works, but not always?                        </div>

                            As audience, Tony, in almost all cases you want to find out what happened <em>eventually</em>.  As you say in your OP, "it can wait until the story's over."  That's because our role as audience extends past our role as players and past when the game is "over".  We are continually experiencing and re-experiencing and re-interpreting what happens in the game.<br/><br/>There are a few instances where something might happen and it need never be known.  I'm thinking of things like the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, where the ambiguity is used as a thematic tool and defining the contents of the briefcase would dispell the ambiguity.  Or, say, the question of whether or not God is controlling the Quantum Leap project -- I can see a "plausible deniability" Dogs game running at around the same level of ambiguity, where the players may never know if they were fighting demons or just being marriage counselors.<br/><br/>There is also the very potent tool in-game of having things happen away from your eyes and then having it reported to you by narrators of dubious authority and reliability.  If the GM and Lord Vogo's player discuss something in the other room, and Lord Vogo tells you he was rolling Dexterity+Laundry to get his socks clean, you get to suspect all game long whether or not you're being duped.<br/><br/>Or here's an Actual Play -- Cyberpunk 2020.  The players all make their characters.  The GM takes the Corper guy aside and gives him the briefing that his Corper guy gets from his superiors.  Corper guy then walks into the room and lays out this completely alternate plan involving totally different corporations and cargoes, but would get the other characters to do the thing that he needed done (steal the McGuffin/block the transmission/something-or-other).  The truth came out in-game, but only partially -- the other players figured out that they weren't <em>actually</em> working for Mitsubishi, but they didn't find out that it was Telus Industries until after the game was over.  It provided some very potent grist in play (can we trust our orders? are we doing what's right? are we going to get paid?).  It was cool stuff.                        </div>

                            Tony, you probably want to go see <a href="http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/?lid=2491" rel="nofollow">House/Garden</a>, Alan Ayckbourn's two plays that take place simultaneously in two different theaters, where the same characters move back and forth between the house and garden where different stories are taking place.<br/><br/>What you're talking about also sounds a lot like the decentralized nature of LARP.  Maybe there are lessons we could learn from LARPers about how to handle simultaneous, decentralized narratives?<br/><br/>This is also very much how <i>Gloria Mundi</i> runs, though in a tabletop format.  We mostly have two or three simultaneous scenes going on at the same time - some player/player, some player/GM, and some even GM/GM.  The only person who knows everything that happens in a given session is our scribe, who keeps all the records in one place for narrative coherence purposes.<br/><br/>At least once a session, someone says something like, "Wait - is THAT what you two were doing in the other room while we were playing in here?  HARDCORE!!!"<br/><br/>About half the time, that person is one of the GMs.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

It's fantastic. You know how close that is to LARPing, though? You can almost define LARPing by saying that players can play without the GM (or other players) overseeing the scene.<br/><br/>That thing about Jake storming in, and he wants a scene, so you go off and do a scene with someone else. That's how a good LARP should work.<br/><br/>(Edited: Oh, wait, Jess said that. Bloody Jess, she always gets in first.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<p>Graham:  Yeah, I've played and run weekend-long combat LARPs that stretch over multiple square miles of territory.  I'm fairly familiar with the structure and communications issues, and I totally agree that they're relevant.</p>
<p>LARPs, however, don't go in very much for some of the advanced tools (like director stance, just to pick one example) that we've got working in table-tops these days.  I'd like to make those work together.</p>
<p>Like, suppose you're doing Buffy (setting, not rules).  Cori is playing Willow and Jeff is playing Giles.  Karl is the GM.  While Karl is having some demons kick Faith's ass, Cori and Jeff take Willow and Giles off to the library.  They play through a scene in which they discover (read "invent") the Big Bad's weakness.  The rules (whatever the heck they are) make it clear that, given their current resources, they <strong>can</strong> do this and that, conversely, the GM <em>cannot</em> be inventing that weakness in the other room at the same time.</p>
<p>Willow and Giles now know the Big Bad's secret.  Cori and Jeff also know it.  Karl, the GM, does not ... and that doesn't really matter too much.</p>

<p>Isn't it really a combination of personal taste and the needs of the kind of story you are telling? Many RPGs attempt to duplicate the experience of the character in the player, so when they choose to adapt elements of fiction where hidden knowledge is important -- mysteries, surprises and betrayals -- the players have to keep information from each other to maintain the same sense of surprise.</p>
<p>It's not actually anything new. This approach to gaming is very old and occurs in three forms:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>secret resources</em>: stuff on your character sheet or in the DM's notes are hidden. This began when the hobby began.</li>
<li><em>secret experiences</em>: the GM pulls you aside and tells you what you see that the others don't, or passes you a note. Almost as old as secret resources; I remember note passing being mentioned in The Fantasy Trip.</li>
<li><em>diffuse experiences</em>: the group is large enough to split into subgroups so that everyone's experiences are potentially secret, as in a LARP.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I object to restricted knowledge on two grounds: personal taste and experimental interest. Although I've played in and enjoyed games that relied on secret resources (which works well in a gamist approach, I only tolerate the secret experiences approach if it's kept to a minimum, and the whole idea of diffuse experiences turns me off. I had this hammered home in the first Burning Wheel game I played; it was the rat-people demo with a group of about 19 people, all split off into small groups doing several things at once. I didn't find it very enjoyable at all.</p>
<p>But in addition to personal taste, there's the matter of experimental interest. Those three techniques are all very old; I'm not interested in creating new games that explore re-using those techniques. I'm much more interested in games that allow full disclosure and separate the feelings of the character from the feelings of the player. Or, better yet, games that emualte surprise or sudden shifts of fortune in a different way, perhaps even using retcon techniques; instead of the team leader in that cyberpunk game knowing in advance who the real employer is and lying about it to the rest of the team, what if a particular game mechanic determines after the fact that the team leader was lying? Then <em>everyone</em> is surprised.</p>

                            I actually really love knowing things OOC that I don't know IC.  Because then I can see the whole picture and how everything fits together.  So if someone doesn't give us info that we all know they have it's a big deal and we all wonder what they're up to.  :)  Or when you know there's a trap in that room, but your character does and they walk straight into it, I love that anticipation.  I feel like I'm blindly floundering when I don't know what else is going on in game, which if you like to keep it as "real" as possible is fine, but I don't like it.<br/>

                            Something Neel said is, I think, relevent here. Because of that, I'm just gonna pop it up full: <br/><code>The games I run and play in aren't stories. When we play, me make this gigantic tangled mass of narrative. There's too much stuff in them to be a story. We make stories out of them, by taking a particular point of view, and highlighting some bits of the mass as important, and sidelining other things.<br/><br/>When you take a point of view to get a slice of the game, you get a story -- protagonists, antagonists, and supporting characters emerge. However, you can slice a game in multiple ways, and get multiple stories. And in each slice, who the protagonists are is different. All from the same play session.</code><br/>To that I'd add a concept from Roland Barthes (oh boy, here I go...), the difference between a "readerly" text and a "writerly" text. In a readerly text you get a story that tells itself, that is pretty simple and straightforward and easy to understand. It carries all its meanings inside it, and simply requires you to understand its words to understand its story. In a writerly text, otoh, you have to tease out the meaning of the story. You have to bring yourself to, and you have to wrestle with it in order to get meaning out of it. As the man said: "Writerly text is ourselves writing, before the infinite play of the world is traversed, intersected, stopped, plasticized by some singular system (Ideology, Genus, Criticism) which reduces the plurality of entrances, the opening of networks, the infinity of languages"<br/><br/>In terms of games, readerly texts are games that make a coherent story at the end of which you know the story and can be done with it. Writerly texts are games that when you are done playing you can start figuring out what they were about and what they meant to you. <br/><br/>A lot of our work recently in RPG design and play has been geared towards making stories and narratives, and of that the majority seems to be headed at a readerly perspective. We make stories that we all understand, that are communal to the group, and that carry their meaning complete and fully encoded within the game and the narrative we create together. Everyone knows what is going on, if not in all the details, than in the main, and the story makes sense to everyone as it stands. We go out of our way to make things make sense, tie up lose ends, and make sure that when we are done, the story is done. <br/><br/>Now Tony, I could be wrong, but I think one of the things you're looking at doing would be a possible technique for making a more writerly game -- a game where we produce a text in play, and figure out what it means later. If there are all these different streams going on, of which we have only a limited knowledge about their full extent, then it keeps us from having a stable and defined meaning about what the story of the game is, what the game means, or even if our character is a/the protagonist or not. <br/><br/>As a note, because of the way that games are constructed, it would seem to me that we have to add an extra layer to Barthe's schema. We create the game as writers, but we also experience the game as text. So "writerly" and "readerly" don't mean "how much narrative power you have durring the game to craft the story" they mean "how much work you have to do afterwards to understand the story." I'd posit that how much narrative authority you have in game actually has little to do with how much the game text ends up being writerly or readerly in this context. <br/><br/>In so doing it would very certainly make a game that would require us to work, to search for meaning both durring and after play, and that could be a very cool thing. <br/><br/>So Tony, is anything I'm saying making any kind of sense to you? Do you like the idea of game not being easy, of story not being given to you in a lump of your own creation? Do you want to do the work as you create, after you create, both? Create the game, then create the text, then create meaning from the text? Texts? Get all fully post-modern and destroy the very idea of the game as a metanarrative and get back to the point where all we have is a collection of disperate voices that may or may not even be telling the same story? <br/><br/><br/>P.S. "readerly" and "writerly" are fucking stupid, ugly terms for the concept. If anyone else has ideas for non jargony ways to put it, please speak up. I'm too tired atm to rename Barthe's idiot tropes for him.                        </div>

<p>Almost every table-top roleplaying game I've ever encountered takes that spaghetti-tangle of potential energy and flattens it with a fuckin' steamroller, into a single shared viewpoint, switching back and forth, but always in unison.</p>
<p>In "distributed programming" terms, you've got a whole bunch of really powerful, really configurable processors (i.e. players) and you're making them all replicate each other's work by operating them in near-complete lockstep.</p>

                            Tony: <br/>
<br/>
My first real enculturation into rpgs as a craft was through people who were way into the MIT Assassin's Guild, which is the larp group there. In that millieu it was "obvious" that you should keep secrets and that no one would know what was going on until the postgame wrap, including the GMs. So games where all the information was out in the open were a radical innovation for me -- I was, figuratively speaking, running around and babbling excitedly about the idea that you could tell everyone everything and then bring things like dramatic irony into your game. <br/>
<br/>
Audience stance was a giant, radical innovation for me when I realized it existed, and to a certain extent I still feel that way.  Your post is reminding me super-strongly that not all gamers evolve the same way. The way you're writing, the open table is the old-hat norm and keeping secrets is the weird wild idea. <br/>
<br/>

<p>It's not so much keeping secrets that's new ... the old "Go off onto the porch with the GM" thing is pretty old-hat for me as well.</p>
<p>It's the idea of outright <em>removing</em> the GM as the gatekeeper through whom all contributions to the game-world must pass that's getting me hot in my shorts.

<p>Prrrrobably depends on the game.</p>
<p>For <em>Misery Bubblegum</em>, for example, I may want to have a way to represent who has the right to narrate a character's commitments and future ... and that right may <em>not</em> reside with the player playing that character.</p>
<p>So two players playing parents could go off and create an arranged marriage between the characters of two other players ... without consulting them, of course.  They don't <em>need</em> to consult them, because they "own the rights" (or whatever) on those parts of those characters.</p>
<p>'course, if the players of the affianced couple want to change those plans they need to get into some scenes where they wrest control of those elements from their parents.  But if they just want to build up a complicated relationship between themselves, they can do that on their own.  Indeed, they probably <em>want</em> to do that, so as to give them the resources to eventually wrest back control of their lives.</p>
<p>... for example.</p>
<p>Does that make any sense?</p>

                            Sure, absolutely, makes sense to me.  But I guess the question is this: are the players making up the elements that go into the pot to be fought over, or is there a set of elements that different people can have control over but are essentially static and descriptive?  For example, do all characters have "future" and "commitment" elements, or is that only if you want to have them? <br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            It's a fascinating idea. Let me try and understand it with a practical example.<br/><br/>I ran a one-shot werewolf LARP (very freeform, not Storyteller) last year. One problem was that I didn't have enough time with players. I wanted to give them time so they could (for example) research the werewolves' history to find useful stuff. <br/><br/>Now...you're saying...why not write it into the mechanics that players can research the werewolves' history <i>without me being involved</i>. I really like that. <br/><br/>You could easily do it, too. On a very basic level, you could have a piece of card that says: "If you're holding this piece of card, you can research the history of the werewolves, and discover their own fatal flaw. Decide what that flaw is."<br/><br/>And obviously you could make it more mechanical if you wanted ("If you have four Kings, you can research the history of the werewolves"). And you could make the card an actual physical object ("This is an ancient leathery tome. If you're holding this...").<br/><br/>Is that the sort of thing, Tony, or am I way off base? Because this is giving me lots of good ideas.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<p>That's the general sort of thing, yeah.  There also needs to be a way that the fatal flaw of the werewolves gets communicated between players as and when it's needed ... but get those two things working properly and I think there's a lot of possibility there.</p>

                            Yeah, that's what I mean. Guild games were these ten day long affairs with like 3 gms and 50 players, played across the whole campus. That GM/player ratio and scale meant that the mechanics were as GM-free as possible, and as a consequence it meant that nobody really knew what had gone on until after the game ended and there was the big postgame where everyone filled each other in on what had happened. The most admired players were the ones who were absolute masters of information control, and who could figure out what was going on before anyone else and manipulate people into accomplishing their goals for them. These were the people who had everyone else shouting "You bastard!" in a delighted tone of voice when they found out how they had been gulled in the postgame.                        </div>

<p>Heh.  Here's a thought.</p>
<p>Capes operates on a synergy between Story Tokens (which you get for losing) and Inspirations (which you get for winning).  That encourages people to seek out opportunities to <em>both</em> lose and win.</p>
<p>I wonder what happens if you build a game that operates on a synergy between X (which you get by playing at the table with the GM) and Y (which you get by taking another player aside for private play).</p>

<p>'nother realization in terms of the purely practical.</p>
<p>If any subset of the gaming group can do gaming together ... the gaming group doesn't actually need to get together all at the same time.  Or, rather, they certainly <strong>can</strong> and probably <strong>should</strong> ... but the game isn't restricted to running 7:30-10:00 every second thursday, just because that's the only time everyone can get together.</p>
<p>Two folks could meet up in the hallways and play the game while walking between classes.  And it would be <em>playing the game</em>.  It would have an impact.  The fiction they created then would be as much part of the story as anything else.</p>
<p>About two seconds after realizing this I also realized "Wow, this would make it hugely easy to run the game in an asynchronous, play-by-email format."  But, really, by comparison with being able to <em>walk up to a friend in the lunch room</em> and say "We ought to play out that scene where Jessie and Rick get trapped at the bus stop in the rain," and <em>just do it</em> ... well, the email innovation seems sort of pale and sickly by comparison.</p>

                            Yes, this seems really cool, but I've been in games that were run this way, and it has the potential for major social badness.  Some people invariably end up feeling left out, people play more with their friends, the people who have more time to contribute have much more influence over what happens, and some people just feel like they're along for the ride.  That doesn't mean a game like this couldn't work, but it would need to find systematic ways to handle the social fallout of asynchronous, private, small-group play.<br/><br/>I, too, find it surprising that this notion is such a huge innovation to you, by the way - and it only makes me believe more strongly that we need a place where people from different roleplaying communities can connect.  Lots of roleplayers are already doing things exactly like this.  You could talk to online freeformers and people playing on AIM and in Livejournal (and, as suggested before, LARPers) - they don't all have good solutions, but they're certainly tangling with this notion in interesting ways.  We have tools that they don't have, but they've also got tools of their own that we could borrow and use to enrich both communities.  They've also got a really good sense of the problems that this approach creates.  We don't need to reinvent the wheel - or at least maybe we can sneak a look at other people's design notes for 'wheel' before we do.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>Okay, y'know what, I've <strong>done</strong> online freeform, AIM play, LARPs.  I've spent years of my life intensely involved in each of those communities.  They have many, many techniques that they have come up with on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis, and which they've formalized into traditions.  I know phrases like "God-modding" and why they are important to some people.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is, with all due respect to the many people who have worked hard to make this stuff work, these solutions are little more than trying to hold together a grievously broken engine with bubble-gum and baling wire.  It's like trying to make 1st edition D&amp;D into a game of politics and emotion by adding "Politician" and "Emotional" as character classes.  It does the job, sorta ... but nothing like designing for your goal from the start.</p>
<p>Somebody needs to tear the engine apart and build a whole new engine.  I've sneaked a peek at the design notes.  I feel, despite people's efforts to give us a good wheel, that we need to reinvent that mofo.  The reason I'm excited is that I think we have the tools to reinvent it <strong>well</strong>.</p>

<p>Well, if you've got a good idea on how to encode the signals that need to pass between the disparate groups with mechanical packages that would reward people for maintaining communications without <em>requiring</em> it in a lockstep fashion, that'd be cool.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, if Rick has been placed under a gypsy curse, so anyone he loves will die a horrible death ... relevant players benefit when they get that information.  But Rick's player shouldn't be obligated to "push the recap button" every time he sees a player.  There should be some mechanical thing tied to the gypsy curse which (a) Rick can carry with him ... it's portable and (b) Doesn't unbalance the game if Rick has twenty of them and Jessie only has one and (c) Brings other players up to date (at least up to date <em>enough</em>) with events they didn't witness as part of Rick using it.</p>
<p>'cuz yeah, I hear you with this bit:</p>
<p><code>Some people invariably end up feeling left out, people play more with their friends, the people who have more time to contribute have much more influence over what happens, and some people just feel like they're along for the ride.</code></p>
<p>What I think is being described there is that in most games (including totally freeform ones ... perhaps <em>especially</em> freeform ones) "more play" equates to "more power."  The people who play in cliques with their friends, who post a hundred times to your one, etc., are unbalancing the balance of power between players ... they're accumulating more XPs, or more social cred, or more backstory, or more whatever.</p>
<p>If there's a way to make sure that what those heavy-play players do is <em>important</em> but not in a way that shoves other people aside, I think a lot of those social issues would evaporate.</p>

                            This is just empowering player credibility over changes to the fiction. If any single player, at any time, can say, "X is true in the fiction," then the gatekeeper power traditionally apportioned to the GM is no longer needed. It doesn't matter if two people go off on their own and stuff happens or if the GM is sick that night: what the players say happens, happens.<br/><br/>Bob: I go to the governor of Carai and beg his forgiveness for impregnating his daughter. I tell him I didn't know who she was.<br/>Zoe: Okay, but it's not really his daughter. The Precept was lying to you. Roger and I established that in our little scene when we went outside.<br/>Roger: That's right.<br/>Bob: The Precept only thinks it's not her. He, too, has been bamboozled. I saw she had a scar on the back of her thigh from when she fell off her horse as a teenager and my character was a stable hand at the time so he knows all about it.<br/><br/>Maybe tokens or dice establish the right to trump facts. Universalis provides a starting point for all this.                        </div>

                            Tony, if you feel like this is derailing, tell me and I'll spin it off to a new thread. <br/><br/>It occurs to me that one way around many of the credibility issues of creation in game can be solved (and a whole new set formed) if we think about what we are doing in game as creating a text or narrative rather than creating a reality or finished story. <br/><br/>Thus the Khazars question earlier. <br/><br/>For those who haven't read the book, in the Dictionary of the Khazars there are multiple different dictionaries talking about the same thing (the Khazars and their conversion) -- and the dictionaries flatly contradict both themselves and each other in multiple areas. And yet, after you finish reading the book it is possible to construct a story from it with a little thought. The thing about it, however, is that you have to construct the story, at least partly on your own, because the book leaves you with something not fully finished. <br/><br/>Now, when we play in games -- no matter how we construct the actual play of the game -- we very often are angling for either the creation of an imaginary reality or a finished story. We want things to have "internal concistancy" and to have loose ends wrapped up, and to have the SIS have only one version of "what actually happened" and so forth and so on. In otherwords, we want to avoid all the things that those waky postmodernists did to story and end up with a metanarrative from which all the possible stories of the game come from the joint and total authorial pen of what the group did around the table. <br/><br/>And you know what, that's cool. But it doesn't have to be the only kind of cool. <br/><br/>Jonathan once said that one of his big goals in gaming was to make a game where no one had the ability to say "no." This, of course, led right into all sorts of problems. How do we establish the unity of the SIS with that? How do we protect this, protagonize that, etc. Of course, that all assumes that processes like protagnoization and establishment of SIS are things that happen durring play. That we can look at the story we are creating as we create it and all see the same things about it, get the same take on it, and control it in the same way. <br/><br/>So what if we make games in which you can't say no, and then take the "text" produced by the game to make it into a story afterwards? <br/><br/>So if Bob says the girl is his daughter, she is -- or at least he claims she is. If Jim then later says the girl is his daughter, she is -- or at least he claims she is. If Jenny says she is the girl's mother and neither of them is the father, then she is and they aren't -- or at least so she claims. (And if you think the above sounds silly, I suggest you watch some of the Maury Povich paternity test episodes....) Everyone in the story, including the players as authors, have to deal with the uncertainty of what is going on and deal with the immerging narrative as best as they can. When it is over, when it is all done, then everyone can sit back and be like "wow, that was something. Now, what did it mean? What actually happened there?"<br/><br/>And at that point everyone may come up with different answers -- just like everyone who reads The Dictionary of the Khazars can come up with different answers as to what the book is about. Credibility isn't established in the moment of play, it is established afterwards, by what peices you chose to accept and reject. Just like reading a post modernist story, or doing historical research, or living....  <br/><br/>I'm reminded of something Jared once said about a Lacuna game (I think), it was along the lines of: "So we'd played this hot session at a con, and the next day as I was wandering around I suddenly realized, 'Oh wow! That's what happened! That's what was going on....'" IIRC, he was the GM, and he didn't know what was going on in the game until the next day. <br/><br/>That's some hot shit.                        </div>

<p>Brand:  Doesn't seem like derailing to me.</p>
<p>I will say that I find it fascinating that postmodernist literature and distributed computing have such a fruitful overlap here.</p>
<p>I've written, for instance, programs that run across many computers, the goal of which is to find <em>a solution</em> (any solution) to a problem with many constraints.  Often the simplest way to code for this is to create many, many, many potential solutions, and then have each distributed node "advocate" for its own solution by attempting to justify it in relation to the constraints.</p>
<p>Which is, I think, exactly the same thing you're talking about ... only with CPUs and network protocols rather than readers and stories.</p>
<p>And both of them are different from players and rules.</p>
<p>Dang.  This is sorta getting ... deep, and shit.  I blame the hippies.</p>

                            bq. I will say that I find it fascinating that postmodernist literature and distributed computing have such a fruitful overlap here.<br/>
<br/>
I'm interesting by the overlap you see, but I see two challenges with translating distributed computing precepts into a human interaction.<br/>
<br/>
First, computers can establish (to the extent that their programmers are skilled enough to manage this) absolute authority over some element of the problem domain.  They both are certain that they own a particular datum, and that they do not own all the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Second, it's difficult enough to manage issues of taxonomy in a discrete problem space.  I don't think that the domain of a roleplaying game could even be cleanly described as a continuous problem space.  Honestly, thinking about role playing this way often strikes me a mind-bending in a way akin to transfinites.  So, specifically, in a computing problem, we know that a solution will necessarily be a member of a discrete finite set, and even then it can be difficult to successfully avoid collisions in the namespace.  <br/>
<br/>
It just seems problematic for both of: a player to keep track of what that player might or might not have authorial control over, and the objects of that control overlapping in various difficult to describe ways.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the wonderful flexiblities of human interaction can in all likelyhood overcome these bounds, just as we gleefully ignore Godel's Completeness Theorem in day to day life.  But I question how much the lessons of Computer Science can inform designs of distributed role play.                        </div>

                            That's cause I'm a ROCK STAR.<br/><br/>Actually, I hadn't thought about making the connection to computer science, so you're way ahead of me there.  I just had this sense that representations of the world of the game were going to become, well, problematic.  You do the smart talky thingy.  Is good.<br/><br/>I agree with Brand that the notion of everyone contributing can mean that the "true" meaning of the fiction is going to need to be constructed instead of being obvious - but I think that's not <i>all</i> that far from what's already happening in some games.  It's a spectrum from totally-unanimous-single-plot to let's-make-these-events-mean-something-yikes.<br/><br/><code>(Well, I know what would.

<code>you can't just leave us hanging like that. What, man, what???</code><br/><br/>To answer a question with a question: what would be wrong with me saying, "In the Dictionary of the Khazars I thought there should be more flashbacks?" <br/><br/>To solve the issue of what happens next and who gets to say it, you just have to make it not matter, or already be established, or already have part of the outcome established in a way that lets you mess about with the process, so long as you don't violate the known quantities. <br/><br/>Most games I've played in, seen, or heard about (I'd say more than 98%, but I could just be showing my ignorance here) play in a general sense of choronological order. Sure, there is sometimes time play, flashbacks, forshadowing, and all those things -- but the narrative is a traditional positivist choronological construct with a heavy emphasis on causality. <br/><br/>So, run your game like Memento. Or Dictionary of the Khazars. Or.. insert your favorite post-modernist work with a non-linear or at least non-directly-causative structure here.  <br/><br/>So, you know, once we get to the Slaughterhouse-Five point and get the characters (if not the players) to accept that "Among the things the can not change were the past, the present, and the future." <br/><br/>And I do think it can be done in a game, but it'll take some work. And players who want that sort of nonesense.                        </div>

<p><code>Second, it's difficult enough to manage issues of taxonomy in a discrete problem space. I don't think that the domain of a roleplaying game could even be cleanly described as a continuous problem space. Honestly, thinking about role playing this way often strikes me a mind-bending in a way akin to transfinites. So, specifically, in a computing problem, we know that a solution will necessarily be a member of a discrete finite set, and even then it can be difficult to successfully avoid collisions in the namespace.</code></p>
<p>Okay ... know that I offer the following simplistic solution with a full understanding of the issues you're talking about.  I'm not (I think) being stupid and I'm not joking ... cool?</p>
<p>Why not just write down the things people can effect on index cards?  Or on the character sheet?</p>
<p>Specifically, why not let people <strong>vie for the right</strong> to be the gatekeeper for particular issues in the fiction?  If you control "Rick's obligations" then no scene about his obligations can happen, at all, without you present.  That element of the fiction does not exist to be grappled with in the game that other people are playing in your absence.</p>
<p>Now suppose you aren't playing Rick.  Suppose I'm playing Rick.  I want to renege on one of my obligations (say, "Going to the winter formal with your character").  I'm very intent upon this.  I have lots of scenes with Jessie where I express my desire to do this thing.</p>
<p>But I can't do it in a scene with Jessie.  I can only do it in a scene which includes you.  If you're playing Mandy, and Rick's promised to go to the formal with Mandy, and you control Rick's Obligations ... well then, I need to have a scene with Rick and Mandy.  I can't change the fictional element "Rick's Obligations" until that happens.</p>
<p>So, in all seriousness, what's the problem with chopping up the namespace of fictional elements that way?  Seems well within the whole general-fiction capability of the processing units (i.e. players) to maintain that, and the desire to wrest resources from another unit in order to pursue your goals will lead to terrific conflicts ... my scene with you would be about Rick and Mandy having it out about who gets to say what Rick is obligated to do and whether he'll do it.  That's intense stuff.</p>

                            Hmm, potentially non-linear time play that has mechanics that exist soley to determine who gets to define discreet aspects of the game space, all of which make it possible to play sans GM? Where have I seen that before? <br/>
<br/>
Take Universalis, remove the turn order and seating arrangements, require a player to pay one Coin to take a turn at any time (this is basically saying that all turns are taken using the Interruption rule), and I think you've got what you're looking for. The central problem - what happens when players "come back to the table" only to find that contradictory facts have been established? Well, either deal with it in a postmodern way, or you use the Challenge rules to eliminate one of the contradictory facts.<br/>
<br/>
One interesting game we played started with a scene at one point in time, and then it jumped back in time a year, and play proceeded to become all about explaining how the first scene had happened. Facts established in that scene could be used to challenge anything that happened in later scenes that wouldn't allow for the later facts to happen. For example we couldn't kill any of the characters, because we knew that they were alive a year later. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying it's the ultimate solution for this sort of play, simply that Universalis can handle it with very litte Gimmickry. In fact, if you allow players to come back to their seat to pick up "free turns," then you don't have to change the rules one bit. <br/>

<p>So, all this post-modern, non-linear-time hippy crap aside (at least for the length of this post) ... here's a rough sketch of a situation in which this disconnected play is powerfully <em>better</em> for a certain theme than 'round the table play.</p>
<p>Among other stuff that happens in a game, players can place side-bets on the achievements, choices and actions of other characters.  They spend resources that they got by playing with the GM (Victories in the classic sense) and write down (for instance) "Tamahome loves me: 5" on an index card.  Then when the bet is resolved the card becomes worth that many of either Happy Points ("He loves me!") or Misery Points ("He loves me not ...") depending on the results.</p>
<p>People can pre-spend on the assumption that they're going to get one result or another.  Like, if Miaka is totally convinced that Tamahome doesn't love her (even without evidence) she can start spending her Misery points.  If it turns out that she guessed (or was informed) wrongly than the amount that she spent is added to the opposite pool ... if she spent 4 Misery points, but it turns out he <em>does</em> love her then she gets the original bet (5) plus her overspend (4) for 9 Happy points.  What a relief!</p>
<p><em>But</em>, if you spend out the entire thing?  'sGone.  Even if you were wrong about how you bet on it, you've resolved the emotional issue and there's nothing more to be had from it.  So if Miaka had spent her whole 5 Misery points off of her belief that Tama-chan didn't care for her at all then finding out that he does no longer makes her happy.  She's moved on.</p>
<p>Of course, as time goes on, you can keep adding to the bet through your actions.  So if you have Miaka confess her love to Tamahome, maybe that boosts the card up to "Tamahome loves me: 8."</p>
<p><em>And</em> ... you can hand these cards off to somebody else, making them your agent in adjudicating the bet.  They can increase the value, and the bet is only resolved when <em>they</em> are in a scene that resolves it.  So ... permutations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miaka hands off "Tamahome Loves Miaka: 8" to Nuriko.  Miaka and Tamahome then have a big fight, and Miaka is shown (mechanically!) that he doesn't love her ... whether it's true or not.  The bet does <em>not</em> resolve.  Nuriko tells Miaka to take heart, that it's got to be some sort of misunderstanding.  But then ... does Nuriko go to confront Tamahome about it?  Or does she subtly try to shift the balance first?  Because if she confronts him then the bet will be resolved.  But if she dances around the subject for a while she might <em>change the outcome</em> in time to resolve the bet in Miaka's favor.</li>
<li>Vicky knows that Ed thinks Sylvie wants him to ask her out.  Ed is already spending the Happy points because he presumes he's won that bet.  But Vicky overheard Sylvie talking, and knows that Ed is wrong.  She doesn't want to dash the poor guy's hopes, but she <em>does</em> want to stop him from spending more Happy that's only going to turn into Misery later!  What to do?</li>
<li>Jess desperately wants to know whether Rick just likes her, or <em>likes her</em> likes her.  She enlists Maggie to go ask him, handing off her "Rick Likes me likes me" bet to Maggie.  But Maggie also has feelings for Rick.  She doesn't raise the topic with him at all, but comes back and tells Jess that Rick thinks she's a big fat runny-nose baby-head.  Jess is crushed, and starts spending Misery like a wild-girl.  Maggie works industriously to keep Rick and Jess apart, so that Jess can get over him before Rick reveals that he <em>does</em> like Jess that way, and turns all that Misery back around into Happy.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I think that what you've got there (again, rough sketch form) is a system where people are deliberately manipulating the ways in which they and others know or don't know things about the fiction.  And, plus, it's totally high school.  We've <strong>done</strong> this sort of knowledge manipulation and self-deception.</p>

                            I think that getting people to develop their own, very specific stakes is smart, as opposed to trying to be more generally descriptive.  The highschool metaphor is a good one because, as you say, it's all about what you do and don't know.  I would just add that I've found it really tough, in my experience, to keep too many levels of "this is what this person thinks, but this is what they think I think, etc." in your head at one time.  You might want to consider how that could be supported instead of just hoping that players will be able to do it - since in almost every game I've seen played that requires this kind of deep multi-level assuming about characters, a lot of people just plain can't do it.<br/><br/>What I really like the most: your power over other players is determined by how much they want to give you authority over their plot.  This game is kind of a popularity contest in and of itself - but a structured one, so I can see you introducing mechanical elements to make it worthwhile for you to share your plot elements with multiple different players.<br/><br/>I have no idea if this would actually be fun for me - I tend to prefer games where resource management is way less central - but it's neat enough that I would really, really want to try it.  And hey, agnostics are the best kinds of play-testers, right?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            It's more Nuriko, Maggie and Vicky that I think it would be cognitively hard on; they have to keep straight the actual, potential and pretended mental states of several different people.  You're right, Miaka's player would have no problem, because the player just has to know what the character knows.  However, I'm pretty convinced that people have a harder time understanding multiple levels of people-knowledge when they're in character, even if they wouldn't have a hard time with it if it were happening in real life.  I could be wrong, of course, but hopefully next year I'll have some research to back this up.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Some people would be able to do it, no problem - but it sounds like Nuriko, Maggie and Vicky are making play really interesting for everyone involved.

<p>Ah, gotcha.</p>
<p>Well, let me offer this:  As I thought about it, I realized that "resolving" the bet is actually a pretty uninteresting phenomenon.  Here's what I think is happening.</p>
<p>You pose a question:  "Does Tamahome love me?"</p>
<p>You place a value on this question:  5 points.</p>
<p>You have two little boxes on the card:  Misery and Happy (or whatever ... names aren't really the point yet).</p>
<p>Through play (and, probably, through <em>mechanics</em>) that question gets "answered."  Answered for now, for a particular context, as far as you know, etc.  The card gets <strong>set</strong> to one of either Misery or Happy.  Tamahome spurns Miaka (for whatever reason) and the "Tamahome Loves Miaka?" card gets set to Misery.</p>
<p>The creator of the card can use it to roll dice of the appropriate type.  When they roll a die they make a little circle in the box.  If they get as many circles as the value of the card then the card goes away.  Miaka spends four Misery dice off of the card.  Now there are four little circles.</p>
<p>Through play the question can get answered <em>again</em>.  Obviously, the interesting thing here is when the answer flip-flops the situation.  Tamahome admits that he was only spurning Miaka because he thought that if she got close to him it would put her in danger!  What relief!</p>
<p><em>Now</em>, as long as there are circles in the (now inactive) Misery area, you can get Happy dice by filling in those circles.  When you run out of circles you get Happy dice by making circles in the Happy section.  Miaka gets four dice by filling in her Misery, and four dice by making four circles in the Happy section.  Obviously she now needs to flip-flop the question again.</p>
<p>So ... if this is the setup then Nuriko has a very simple question to her:  Does she want to flip-flop the question from Happy to Misery.  She doesn't really have to think too hard about "Miaka thinks that Tamahome thinks that Hotohori ordered him to kill Suboshi, but actually it was Suboshi's twin brother Amiboshi who had come back from the dead to ..." (and, by the way, this is <em>not</em> out of character for the source material)  All she has to do is look at the card and say "I would rather have Miaka miserable about this than happy about it, right now.  I know!  I'll make a scene with Tamahome where I oversee him in the arms of another woman!"</p>
<p>I mean, I'll have to playtest it, but that seems fairly workable to me.  It's not that Nuriko (and Miaka, and Tama-chan) won't be confused by each other's motivations.  They will!  They should!  But they don't need to figure it out in order to keep playing.</p>

                            This may be a tangent, but -- in a larp, once you hit a certain critical mass, NO ONE is going to know all of what happened. Not the players, not the gms (or whatever you want to call them).<br/>

I still have no idea of most of what happened the last time we ran Jamais Vue. I know what one major decision was, but I have no idea why those players made that decision.<br/>

In a long ago larp, one woman who let her PC be seduced to the dark side by another player's PC really wished that there'd been some way for everyone to see that, as she thought he was being very cool.<br/>

To a degree, larps compensate for this with something we call Game Wrap.<br/>
<br/>
That is, the game is now officially over -- last actions have been taken, we're all sitting down and firmly out of character.<br/>
<br/>
The gms thank everyone for playing. Hopefully, the players have had a good enough time to thank the gms for running.<br/>
<br/>
"Now," says one of the gms. "About what was going on..."<br/>
<br/>
This or some similar phrase begins the ritual known as Game Wrap.<br/>
<br/>
The two usual methods for doing this are:<br/>
<br/>
1. By plot thread<br/>
2. Around the room, by PC<br/>
<br/>
It isn't perfect. Folks will have to leave early. You won't get everything, and even if you do, it's not the same as being there, seeing it unfold.<br/>
<br/>
But, it does help, and it's a lot of fun. It's a nice transition between Gaming and Not-Gaming. It's the Grounding part of the ritual, especially if folks help with teardown (if necessary).<br/>
<br/>
Is there any mechanism for doing this in tabletop? If this were some very odd version of PtA, I'd be tempted to say that these are the cast interviews on the DVDs.<br/>

<p>Lisa:  The thing about LARP game-wraps is that they are (to my mind) part and parcel of the one-shot nature of most LARPs.</p>
<p>People in continuing LARPs (of which I've been in a few) don't always do the same thing.  They still look forward to finding out what happened in the session they just participated in, but they can hope to find that out through playing next week's session.</p>

                            Damn, this thread moves fast.  I don't think this has been addressed yet, and I'll edit in fixes if it has been.<br/>
<br/>
bq. Specifically, why not let people vie for the right to be the gatekeeper for particular issues in the fiction? If you control "Rick's obligations" then no scene about his obligations can happen, at all, without you present. That element of the fiction does not exist to be grappled with in the game that other people are playing in your absence.<br/>
<br/>
Here's my point, and it relates to another issue I'm having in the abstract with functional RPG design, which maybe I'll get to later.  <br/>
<br/>
Suppose we chop up the narrative space along the axis of characters.  Each character is their own card.  So there's Albrecht, Bonnie, Charles, each with their own card, and in the course of play they may or may not be owned[1] by the  respective player of those characters, right?  What about if Ablrect and Bonnie are married?  First of all, can the Albrect's owner dictate that Albrecht and Bonnie get a divorce?  Have kids?  What about their shared bank account?  Or do you need Bonnie's card as well to do almost any of that?  What about if Albrecht and Bonnie invite Charles and Diana (Charles's wife) to dinner?  How many cards do I need to do that?<br/>
<br/>
A lot of those questions seem like they have very fuzzy answers, and if you establish _any_ set of rules for when I need which cards, I suspect I can invent a relatively common situation where your rules are ambiguous.  And, I'd propose that pretty quickly the rules become unworkable because of the ambiguity and simple disagreement between what is and isn't inside the scope of authority of a card.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if I need cards present to change anything that involves any character, you might as well be playing in lock-step, since any partitioning of the group will lead, I think, to deadlocks.  To complete my scene with Jess, I need Albrecht and Bonnie, where for you to complete your scene with Brand, you need Bonnie and Charles, and Levi and Ben need Albrecht and Charles, and each group of us has one character.[2]<br/>
<br/>
And, what about the case where we establish in passing a game-world celebrity, and then later we both want to introduce the celebrity into play.  Either we can't because there's no card, we can say whatever we want because there's no card (and we risk the narrative clash we were trying to avoid) or we each create a card on the spot, and now there's two cards for the celebrity.  Or there's a gatekeeper for creating cards, which is granted, a more limited role than before, but it's still a gatekeeper.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don't think these problems are insoluble.  But I don't know that IPC(Inter-process Communication)-style token passing is a good way to go.  I think that Brand has an excellent idea with post-modern storytelling - especially if you use the worky trick of removing time-line referents.  Alternatively, the players are insane, inebriated, close-to-light-speed, or inhabitants of a world where they're not clear on cause and effect, simultaneity[3] or any other concept that would make the storytelling problematic.  I think human players would be better at accepting and smoothing out narrative clashes in the right context, then they would be at avoiding them in parallel play.<br/>
<br/>
**edit:**<br/>
Or Tony could just solve the whole thing with his amazingly sexy sketch of a Japanese high-school drama.  Man, does that sound cool.<br/>
<br/>
fn1. in the sense of "having absolute authorial power over"<br/>
<br/>
fn2. Sorry.  I'm sure that you're familiar with the Dining Philosophers Problem, but I doubt it's in general circulation.  (Five Chinese guys sit down to eat in a circle - they each grab the chopstick on their left, and then wait for their right neighbor to put down the right chopstick to begin eating.)<br/>
<br/>
fn3. Which, of course, modern Physics tells us is impossible, anyway.                        </div>

<p>Judson:  Two things.</p>
<p>First, I don't think breaking along the axis of the characters is a great idea, precisely because stories almost never deal with a character as a unit of narrative.  Usually (as you point out) stories deal with the relationships between characters ... and so it's probably better to make those relationships (or the individual pieces of them) into units.  Like "A + B's marriage" and "A + B's love."  You can look at that and immediately know what people need control over in order to get a divorce.</p>
<p>And, second ... the dining philosopher's problem occurs because the philosphers are (no offense intended to otherwise serviceable fictional constructs) <em>fucking morons.</em>  When they don't have the resources to do X they just sit there and thrash, rather than saying either "Hey, we <em>do</em> have the resources to do Y ... how about we do that until the other resources get freed up?" or saying "Okay, who do you need to kill around here to get the resources I need?"</p>
<p>So, basically, I still don't think I get what you're saying.  Yes, there are ways to do this wrong (for instance, you could break out fictional authority by the first letter of the element ... but then, to effect the Abominable Snowman do I need "A", "S" or "Y"?  Or all three?) but I don't yet see the argument that makes me think there aren't also ways to do it right.  You dig?</p>

In tabletop, we're familiar with the "popcorn rule" or various other sorts of "bullshit" methods by which players can stop the introduction of inappropriate material. In an asynchronous play model, obviously there's no corresponding mechanism at work to assure that social boundaries are not crossed. Coherence, linearity, all that jazz - I'l stipulate that we can junk it and have something still worth doing. I'm not nearly so sanguine about "You did WHAT?!? You creep! How could you? That's disgusting. I feel completely betrayed."                        </div>

<p>Mark, JBR:  Yeah, that's exactly the issue of the player's ongoing role as audience that I'm interested in.  Audience as tacit mass gatekeeper, sorta.</p>
<p>Now here's a ... wrench in the wrench?  A counter-wrench?</p>
<p>Suppose that you've got a game with the following social setup:  Alex, Becca and Corey are playing high school students Quentin, Rebecca and Sean.  Alex quietly assumes that, the game has a PG rating ... no sex.</p>
<p>Becca and Corey go off and have a scene between Rebecca and Sean.  A sex scene.  A steamy sex scene.  Alex isn't there, so he can't throw popcorn.</p>
<p>Now ... Alex is never going to be subjected to that sex scene.  He doesn't have to hear about the details.  So to the extent that his issue is "I don't want to have people describing pornographic material around me," he's covered.  Right?</p>
<p>However, he might very well be subjected to a plot-line of Becca being pregnant, and what happens as a result of that.  So to the extent that his issue is "I don't want to have to deal with mature themes of sexuality and its consequences," he's screwed.  Right?</p>
<p>As with your first wrench, this isn't meant to be a rebuttal of your point.  Your point is solid.  I'd like to examine it in a bit more detail, and I think this is some of the detail I'd like to take a look at with people.</p>
<p><em>EDIT:  Quick, honest question ... did I just recapitulate the difference between Lines and Veils?  It sorta sounds that way, but maybe that's just yet another sign that I never understood them rightly in the first place.</em></p>

                            I think there's a third level, Tony, that you're glossing over.<br/>
<br/>
Becca and Corey get the hoo-yay sex scene, that's one thing, that's immediate content that Alex doesn't ever see.  Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Becca gets pregnant, that's another thing, that's a consequence of an action that Alex didn't see, that impacts the storyline, and Alex probably has to interact with that, if only peripherally.<br/>
<br/>
However, Becca gets tentacle-raped by Corey who turns out to be a mystical hentai monster from the Thousand Hells of Kuala Lampur... and especially if Becca then becomes pregnant with Corey's demon child... well then, they've gone a step beyond the content that Alex wanted to deal with within a given setting/genre/context, and they've gone and completely redefined the setting/genre/context.  Anything that Alex does after he finds out Becca could feature in a Coleridge poem will be completely recontextualized, and probably into territory that Alex has no interest in dealing with in the least.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>How often in your games do you find that you have to turn down the idea of the tentacle monster raping the teenager in the real world based highschool game? <br/><br/>No, seriously, I'm asking for real and not rhetorically. <br/><br/>Because I was all sitting here, nodding along with your point and thinking, "that is a huge fuck of an issue" and then I thought, "it's like the time when...." <br/><br/>And then I kind of stalled, and had to go back years in order to remember a clear time of when a whole group had to act to reject something so far out of whack with what the game was doing. *<br/><br/>I mean, I know that the group acting as gatekeeper is important, and in some groups it's probably a constant fight. But at the stage in my RPing life I'm in, my groups seem to mostly take care of it themselves based on social cues and the social contract that we so carefully setup before game. <br/><br/>(Not to mention that in the above, Alex is the odd one out. He is the one of three not down with what is going on, so even in a traditional game it could well be that his "gatekeeping" is overridden by the desire of the larger group. Depends if you're going for democracy or oligarchy in your game, I guess.) <br/><br/>In fact, the most recent relevant AP I can think of towards this situation is when I was playing Bitches the other night and Jess asked me if she could use some trait or another and I responded with, "Don't bother justifying it to me. It's your character and your story, if you can justify it to yourself, chances are I'll never have a problem with it." <br/><br/>In otherwords, I tend to tell my players they are their own gatekeepers, and have their own agency. Most of the time, it works.<br/><br/><br/>*As opposed, oddly, to tricky implementations of the rules or mechanics -- which we have to come to group consensus over all the time.                        </div>

                            bq. First, I don't think breaking along the axis of the characters is a great idea, precisely because stories almost never deal with a character as a unit of narrative. Usually (as you point out) stories deal with the relationships between characters ... and so it's probably better to make those relationships (or the individual pieces of them) into units. Like "A + B's marriage" and "A + B's love." You can look at that and immediately know what people need control over in order to get a divorce.<br/>
<br/>
Well, certainly.  But I think the exact same thing applies if you use character's relationships as your axis of division.  You laid part of the issue out in your example.  (Although, I suspect, only accidentally.)  Are there separate cards for different relationships between the same two people?  <br/>
<br/>
If so, do I only need Alfred is Married to Bebe to divorce them, or do I also need Alfred Loves Bebe as well?  And, if I can divorce them so long as I don't impact their love, I see that as awkward at the least.  Plus, how do I know that Alfred Loves Bebe exists (as a card) if I don't hold it?<br/>
<br/>
Even if cards are unique by pairs of characters, so essentially the card is Alfred and Bebe, with the notes that they're married and in love, you have the problem of relationships of relationships.  If Deirdre, Eddie (are dating) and Deirdre, Frank (are dating) both exist, can I get Deirdre and Eddie married without holding Deirdre, Frank?  Doesn't that impact Deirdre, Frank?  Hell, just to drive it home, in the next room the guy who does hold Deirdre, Frank has them get married.  Presuming that Deirdre holds fairly traditional marital values, we have an issue.<br/>
<br/>
And the further point of new elements being introduced stands, only moreso, since we could easily create a new relationship between any two characters, unless all n(n -1)/2 relationships exist from the beginning on cards, and no new characters are introduced in play.<br/>
<br/>
My earlier comment about any set of rules to work this way includes the axis you use to divide the narrative space into units.<br/>
<br/>
bq. And, second ... the dining philosopher's problem occurs because the philosphers are (no offense intended to otherwise serviceable fictional constructs) fucking morons. When they don't have the resources to do X they just sit there and thrash, rather than saying either "Hey, we do have the resources to do Y ... how about we do that until the other resources get freed up?" or saying "Okay, who do you need to kill around here to get the resources I need?"<br/>
<br/>
The other (more charitable) alternative is that the philosophers doesn't have perfect knowledge of each other's circumstances.[1]  Much like the hypothetical play groups acting out scenes in different rooms.  While the players can say "dammit, where's Paul, Robert (homosexual love affair)?" and go looking, someone has to do it, and interrupt play, and all that.  And given that it could happen, my intuition is that without some method to prevent it, it will happen rather frequently.<br/>
<br/>
Now, don't get me wrong, I love this idea in general, and I think there are ways to make it work - even ways related to what you're proposing.  But I think the challenge of designing a system for processors and designing a game for players are very different, and necessarily the solutions will be different.  Although, there's probably something to be taken from each problem that applies to the other, I think that understanding is very different than either of us might suspect.<br/>

<br/>
More constructively, Brand, that's exactly it. Why doesn't Capes go silly all the time? Because we get constant, immediate feedback from everyone at the table. You can internalize that effect reasonably well through experience with a given group of people - you get to know Alex well enough that your internal model of him says "no way" to the tentacle thing. The thing is, the more open the game, the more likely that you're going to run into some idea that you don't have a solid model of how Alex will react. You know he doesn't want tentacle monsters, but is this genderfuck plot idea going to cross the line? Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm getting at is that this is IWNAY on a whole frickin' new dimension.<br/>
<br/>
In a typical, healthy, solid communication TTRP group, if you cross a Line, you get immediate feedback. You can step back and say oops. In asynchronous play, you may be several miles on down the road past the Line when the Veil gets wrenched aside. I hope your social relationships are rock solid.                        </div>

Point taken, and I'd likely have figured that out if I'd like, y'know, read the whole thread before posting. Hazards of skimming at work.<br/>
<br/>
I do wonder if the Game Wrap idea is transferable, though, and I find the idea of "extras on the DVD" oddly charming, even if I did come up with it myself.<br/>

<p>Let me think ... Alfred is demanding a divorce for good and solid reasons that have nothing to do with lack of love ... and Bebe's sitting there responding "But you still love me!  I know you do!" and Alfred's all "Yes, I do."</p>
<p>Frankly ... you say "awkward" and I say "awesome."</p>
<p>That divide is entirely coded in to the fact that these people <em>made 'marriage' and 'love' into two distinct items under the rules</em>.  Somewhere along the line, they said to themselves "Yeah, these are separate concepts."  Those who sow the wind shall surely reap the whirlwind of <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p>So, yeah ... I get that there are challenges here.  I think there's also a whole pile of awesome opportunities.  And, frankly ... I see the challenges that you're laying out, and I'm not terribly scared by them.  I think they look a lot bigger in your imagination than they do in mine.  Hard to say which of us is closer to the truth.</p>

<p>Okay ... which phase of things are we in here?</p>
<p>Are we in the phase where people say "Okay, this is a problem!  I want it recognized as a problem, and so anyone who throws possible solutions at me is undermining my emotional need to have people on the same page with the problem I see"?</p>
<p>Or are we on into the phase where people say "Okay, everyone gets that this is a problem.  So when I offer 'Here's how it's a problem,' everyone knows that what I'm really saying is 'What solutions do we have to this problem in <em>this</em> permutation?  How about in this permutation?' and so on"?</p>
<p>'cuz if we're in that second phase, I have some thoughts on how to solve this (at least for particular games).  But if we're in the first phase I'd obviously be best keeping those ideas to myself for a time.</p>

                            As far as I'm personally concerned, Tony, we're in #2. I bring this to the table as "here's how I've seen asynchrony go wrong in 'social-contract go BOOM!' ways, instead of 'where did the story go?' ways - can we address this stuff at all? Should we try?"<br/>
<br/>
My honest opinion is that there's probably only a limited amount we could do to make this kind of play safe from that perspective - it is going to end up needing a seriously IWNAY social contract pretty much by its structural nature - so we should just slap a big warning label on it to that effect and get moving.                        </div>

                            bq. I see the challenges that you're laying out, and I'm not terribly scared by them. I think they look a lot bigger in your imagination than they do in mine. Hard to say which of us is closer to the truth.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure either of is closer to anything.  What I'm saying, and all I'm saying, is that I'm not really sure how far CS solutions to these challeges will get you, because ultimately they're different kinds of problems, with entirely different difficulties and utilities available.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, with the Alfred and Bebe, in love and married thing.   What if I divorce them without dealing with their love, because I don't know a Alfred Loves Bebe card exists.  There's a little bit of oddness if people assume that Alfred doesn't love Bebe anymore and you come back from the other side of the game with the card that says that they do love each other.<br/>
<br/>
If this is a program, we have to abandon the work, at least.  Roll back the journal, wipe it from memory and totally rework.  Because it's people, as you point out, you do get the really excellent scene between Bebe where she works out that he hasn't stopped loving him.  And Alfred gets the really interesting challenge of explaining everything he's done since the divorce in that light.<br/>
<br/>
But that draws a stark line between the idea working as a program and working as a game.  So I continue to contend (although I may have propped up a wonderful straw man here) that CS principles will apply minimally if at all to this design, and that it'd be better to abandon them earlier rather than later.  <br/>
<br/>
Key to the whole thing, it seems to me, is the fact that human beings can cope with gaps and overlaps in the narrative space.  -Tony's- Your crazy idea about using conflicts and betting Happiness/Misery on them seems to play to this.<br/>

<p><code>If this is a program, we have to abandon the work, at least. Roll back the journal, wipe it from memory and totally rework.</code></p>
<p>Actually, the "distributed computing" sub-discipline I'm talking about is concerned with <em>precisely</em> the problem of how to build programs so that you don't have to do that ... so that multiple asynchronous units can operate in such a way that unexpected events are folded into existing calculations without having to back up even one step, much less start from scratch.</p>
<p>Without going too far into the academic details of it, does that clarification make the tools sound like they might be more applicable than you first thought?</p>

<p><code>The thing is, the more open the game, the more likely that you're going to run into some idea that you don't have a solid model of how Alex will react. You know he doesn't want tentacle monsters, but is this genderfuck plot idea going to cross the line? Maybe.</code></p>
<p>'kay.  Nobody's stood up to say "Recognize my pain!" so I'm going to assume we're all in problem-addressing mode here.  I've gotta go teach a class, then I'll try to put my thoughts together.</p>

I'm (denotatively) skeptical, and therefore intensely curious.  Maybe you could provide a link to the academic details?  Or start this up off-line?  A simple analogy to another sub-discipline might work.                        </div>

                            judson:  I'll analogize, because I (a) don't have a graduate degree in the specialty, and therefore count as a dilettante and (b) think we can get a lot of the techniques described in the context of roleplay as we carry forward, which is probably better for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Analogy:  Book-keeping (at which I am also a mere dilettante).  You can keep books in an easy way that tracks how much money you have at any given moment ... and then if you find out that someone forgot to record a check three months ago you need to go back and change absolutely everything since that moment before your records are accurate.  **Or** you can keep books in a somewhat more complex manner that tracks the flow of money going in and going out, and then when you find out about the unrecorded check you can flip back two hundred pages, write it down the same way you would have if you'd recorded it that day, and the books are immediately updated and accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing with computer programs.  Now, let's talk about RPGs :-)                        </div>

<p>Okay, here's my thoughts on the whole "But what if, unbeknownst to anyone, Alex objects to tentacle-babies?" question.</p>
<p>Well, first off ... what a great question. :-)</p>
<p>And now, straight into potentially ... I dunno ... heresy.  Or, worse, stupidity.  But here's my thought.  The rules system can, in many ways, tell you what's important in the game.  And if the rules system gives you the opportunity to say "Okay, I don't want this to be important," and to make it stick then that's a different but still powerful form of gate-keeping power which (unlike the straight up "This doesn't happen" veto) can be applied asynchronously, as events are communicated from one person to the next.</p>
<p><em>Capes</em> really is a stellar example.  You're allowed to narrate most <em>anything</em> in that bad boy.  But the rules control, very explicitly, the things that are important.  So you can throw your opponent into the sun, and nobody gets steamed, because it is known to be <em>not important</em>.  He'll be back from the sun as soon as he feels like being back.  But proposing "Conflict:  Spark-Boy is humiliated" is a different story.  You make that happen and you've <em>done something</em>.</p>
<p>Now I think one of the ways of alleviating the "Alex doesn't like the story that Bob and Caroline want to tell" issue is to break up the idea of story elements that are <strong>globally important</strong> and make it make sense with the asynchronous type of gaming that we're talking about here.  A story element could be, explicitly and measurably, important to Bob and Caroline, but not to Alex.</p>
<p>Bob and Caroline could, indeed, deal with the whole tentacle-baby thing ... but if the rules never give an opening to make that thread important to Alex (or if they give such an opening and Alex immediately resists it) then as far as he's concerned, that thread isn't important.</p>
<p>There is a voice in my head that says this can't work ... that a tentacle-baby <strong>is important</strong> and nothing can change that.  But I think that voice is wrong.</p>
<p>Recently people on RPG.Net were talking about the "All weapons are the same" rule in Wushu, and someone was complaining that it's utter and complete bullshit, because (their thinking) a pen-knife does the same amount of damage as a great-sword, but the police will bust you for carrying a great-sword where they won't bust you for carrying a pen-knife.  And then some folks pointed out that, under the rules, all weapons are the same ... the police <em>won't</em> bust you for carrying a great-sword, any more than they will for the pen-knife.  That's a stark example of the idea that gamers can simply decide that some things <em>do not matter</em> ... and that the game and the fiction can roll along without incident, so long as nobody is thinking that something should matter to them when it really shouldn't.</p>
<p>Am I making any sense here?  I'm still talking fairly general.  If you want, I can contextualize this in terms of Misery Bubblegum, and talk about the things that I think <em>should</em> matter in that specific game ("Caroline made herself <em>totally vulnerable to Bob</em>, and Bob betrayed her trust,") and the things that <em>shouldn't</em> ("... by tentacle-impregnating her with alien amoeba-spawn").  But I worry that if I jump to the specific solution too soon, people will engage with that, rather than mulling over the idea that there can be <em>many</em> different specific solutions for many different specific games.</p>
