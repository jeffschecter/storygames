I had played it once previously.<br/><br/>If you're not familiar with the game, from the website:<br/><br/><i>Dog Eat Dog is a game of colonialism and its consequences. As a group, you work together to describe one of the hundreds of small islands in the Pacific Ocean, defining the customs of the natives and the mores of the outsiders arriving to claim it. One player then assumes the role of the Occupation force, playing their capable military, their quisling government, and whatever jaded tourists and shrewd businessmen are interested in a not quite pacified territory. All the others play individual Natives, each trying in their own ways to come to terms with the new regime. The game begins when the war ends. Through a series of scenes, you play out the inevitably conflicted relationship between the two parties, deciding what the colonizers do to maintain control, which natives assimilate and which run amok, and who ends up owning the island in the end.</i><br/><br/>I really don't want to do a blow-by-blow of the fiction here. The first order of business is to say: I really, really loved it. It's not often that I have a one-shot game that I immediately want to keep playing again and again, but DED hit me where it counts. I'm still excited to play it more. I feel like I could play it every week for a good while.<br/><br/>Here's a little taste of the second game I played last Saturday, because it seemed the most finished, and I remember it better:<br/><br/>First, you determine Traits for the Natives and the Occupation\u2014each player makes one Trait for each side. You also come up with a name for each people. Everyone writes this stuff down on their own sheet, which I really like. We come up with a shared sense of what these traits mean, but kind of put our own phrasing on it. Ours (from my sheet):<br/><br/>RASHA (Natives)<br/><br/>1. Jewelry/Currency made out of seashells<br/>2. Preserve/smoke seafood<br/>3. Multiple coming-of-age rituals\u2014self-actualization &amp; respect<br/>4. Disbelieve concept of spirit\u2014value long-lasting things<br/><br/>MINEP-HI (Occupation)<br/><br/>1. They come from a war-torn country<br/>2. Rich in ore but otherwise resource-poor<br/>3. Superstitious/incorporate other belief systems<br/>4. Only women can own land<br/><br/>Each Native then makes their own Personal Trait, which is a single touchpoint for defining your character in relation to their culture and the Occupation culture. My character was Petros, with the Trait, \u201cI am a fisherman and the man of my family.\u201d We also had a young boy who was very perceptive and an older woman who wove ceremonial art from fishing nets.<br/><br/>The next step is to determine who plays the Occupation, which infamously is the richest player. Myself and one of the other players, Jackson, had played previously in the day, and followed that rule in our other game. At the beginning of the game Jackson stated he'd like to play the Occupation, so we drifted that rule here and let Jackson play the Occupation. We did have a quick discussion about how much money we made, though. Also, we had determined that Jackson was the Occupation BEFORE we had made up the Traits, which is out-of-order and maybe a little weird, if not game-breaking.<br/><br/>The game has a token economy based on the unspoken social rules between the Occupation and the Natives\u2014every time the Occupation is in a scene (and they can enter a scene at any time they want, whereas Natives have to be invited into scenes), after the scene, we write a new Rule. Unfortunately, I don't have our Record, or I'd write the Rules we ended up with here. The first Rule is: The Rasha are inferior to the Minep-Hi.<br/><br/>We set scenes in turn. If a Native broke a rule, they lose a token. If they followed a rule, they gain a token. If they lose all of their tokens, they briefly get narrative power beyond what they usually have, do something shockingly violent &amp; destructive, and then die. If they get six tokens, their epilogue will show how they are assimilated. The game ends when either all Natives or the Occupation run out of tokens.<br/><br/>We had a nice long game\u20143 to 4 hours. Petros, my character, started out very brash and thumbing his nose at the Minep-Hi. After the second scene, he almost ran out of tokens! I got scared and started playing him more conservatively. I wanted him to live! He compromised his values and I liked him less as the game went on.<br/><br/>It was fucking frightening being a Native in this game. Jackson did a fantastic job as the Occupation, and the Minep-Hi had a casual brutality about them. It felt like anything could happen at any moment, like they could kill me or do worse and I would have no power or recourse to that.<br/><br/>There was a scene where Petros was about to go through his second coming-of-age ceremony, becoming a real man. A couple Minep-Hi women showed up, one pregnant, to the site of the ceremony. The pregnant woman had a knife, and they started quoting some old story about how \u201cthe woman walked through the den of jackals, naked save for a knife, and it is not said how many jackals survived.\u201d This was terrifying. They <b>needed</b> to do this ritual, and my ceremony be damned. We let them do it, and no violence came, but it was nerve-wracking.<br/><br/>The next scene was Petros' ceremony, and a bunch of Minep-Hi had arrived to watch the \u201cfascinating spectacle\u201d. The older woman-artist-matriarch character had been sheperding them around, explaining our rituals, trying to make peace. During my dance, the pregnant Minep-Hi with a knife screamed out\u2014one of the Rasha had touched her belly! They explained, calmly, that the baby's life force had been sapped out, and its spirit was floating around now, and it would only be made right by touching the Rasha girl, Anatasia's, hands to flame to cleanse the mother.<br/><br/>A part of my ceremony was to choose a wife, and in the midst of arguing and threatening violence, I took the young girl Anastasia to the center of the ceremonial area and did the marriage dance with her. This doesn't sound as cool in a write up, but this was a very emotional moment for me in play. Tears were definitely in my eyes. I angrily yelled at them that this was <b>my</b> day, our ritual, and that this was not their place.<br/><br/>All hell broke loose. One of the Minep-Hi's leaders began chanting some singsong thing, like a priest intoning scripture, and the Minep-Hi went batshit, massacring people. Myself and Anastasia escaped, but I was injured and her hands were burned.<br/><br/>I had been playing Petros conservatively up to this point, but Jackson's emotion-ful play of the Minep-Hi in this scene, of their absolute disregard for my day, my ceremony, pushed me over the edge. I didn't give a fuck. I had to spit in their faces and show them the importance of this, by protecting Anastasia. Doing this in this scene cost me all of my tokens, and I Ran Amok in the next scene, dying.<br/><br/>So! Very emotion-laden and emotion-driven play. I love how the process of creating the Natives and Occupation makes such eclectic and unexpected cultural identities. I don't know what else to say about the game at this point, other than that I really love it and need to play it more before I write more about it.<br/><br/>One note\u2014I've heard Liam talk about how the game usually plays in 45min-1hr, due to the spiraling feedback loop inherent in the token economy. I'm only one data point, but I've played this game three times with three different groups and we've never \u201cfinished\u201d per the rules\u2014the Occupation has never run out of tokens nor have all of the Natives run out of tokens. We have played somewhere between 2.5-4 hours each time. Perhaps we play long scenes, but in each game we've had 5-8 scenes, with about that many Rules, and it's just never happened. About half of the Rules seem to apply to any given scene.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400953/#Comment_400953" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T07:19:00+00:00" title="December 16, 2012  7:19AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played twice and each game was about 1.5 hours long.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400956/#Comment_400956" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T08:19:01+00:00" title="December 16, 2012  8:19AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you have very long scenes. 5 scenes in 3 hours seems pretty leisurely.

And that was with the Occupation often deciding that most of the rules weren't applicable to the scenes, which was probably a little too nice to the Natives. With a more cruel Occupation, which is what I suspect is intended, it would have been much faster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400976/#Comment_400976" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T12:39:03+00:00" title="December 16, 2012 12:39PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, long scenes, I guess.

Does something like this exist? Can someone point me to where to look or what to search for? I'm curious about the potential for the mechanics of this game to explore other power-related problems.

Your game sounds pretty spectacular. I'm still surprised that your individual scenes are half an hour long, but if it works for you, then that's awesome.<br/><br/>With regards to Judgement, keep in mind that although it seems like the Occupation runs things, they don't create Rules and they don't set most scenes, so they actually have relatively little power to control how many Rules will be applicable. I mean, technically you can arrest everybody and take them to a different scene where the Rules matter, but that's obviously a messy approach. The real force on the economy is the relationship between the Occupation's willingness to be aggressive and the Native willingness to be resistant. I'm starting to observe some patterns in play caused by different common forms of that relationship, which I think are interesting, but I have to think about it more before writing anything about it.<br/><br/>In terms of scene length, if the game is playing well for you, then obviously you're good either way. If you do feel like the scenes are going too long, though, this is the advice I'd give (I'm probably going to try to put together a FAQ including this): every scene is framed around a specific action that a Native (or the Occupation) might take in response to the ongoing conflict. That action, and the response to it should be the focus of the scene, which is why the game tells you to cut forward past the preparation for that action to actually putting it into effect. (I have observed that people often want to spend some time in preparation basically so that they can develop character and chat, and that's totally awesome if you're having fun. When it starts flagging, though, that's when you want to refer to the book and cut ahead.) Once the action has been taken and the Occupation's response to it has been made clear, that's a good time to end the scene. ("I don't care" is a response.) If you end it before then, you'll know it's too early because you won't be able to make a good Rule, since the Rule describes the Native's perception of the Occupation's response to their action. (I didn't realize this until after publishing, or I might've written it into the book. I also might not have, though, because I want to preserve the possibility that the Occupation and the Natives have different understandings of what the Natives are actually doing.) If you end it too late, you'll have trouble with Rules again because the Natives will have started a new action and the Occupation will have started responding to THAT, so you'll be trying to define one Rule for two interactions. When the Natives start doing a new thing, that's a sign that you need to start a new scene.<br/><br/>Again, if you're having a lot of fun, don't worry about this, but if you start feeling like scenes are long, this is how I would tighten them up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401000/#Comment_401000" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T16:04:30+00:00" title="December 16, 2012  4:04PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks Liam. That's helpful. Our long scenes weren't (usually) long because they were flagging, but because they were breathing, if you know what I mean. I know how to play a 1.5/2 hour game of Fiasco, and I suppose I could try playing DED in that mode. I don't think our scenes were <i>really</i> 30 minutes long--maybe one of them scratched that point. Keep in mind the set-up, breaks, making Rules, etc.<br/><br/>Hannah, I was talking about Asocena, a supplement for Dog Eat Dog that contains a bunch of twists on DED, such as for a special ed classroom, the Stanford prison experiment, an immigrant situation, etc. I got it as a part of the Kickstarter. I don't see it on Liam's site, though.
