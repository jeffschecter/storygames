See, the thing is, I <i>like</i> prepping for D&amp;D.  I love doing the math on all the NPCs, working out neat little tactical challenges, interactions of moster abilities and scenery, planning cool ambushes and neat descriptions of the backdrop and the bad guys.  But it <i>is</i> frustrating, doing all this prep and then not using it, or worse, railroading the PCs into your dungeon just because you've done so much work on it.  So I thought of this idea.  The players have bought into the idea of dungeon delving, by virtue of playing the game.  They <i>want</i> to be facing level appropriate challenges with a focus on combat, or they wouldn't be playing D&amp;D.  But, if they're good little protagonists, they also want to be making choices about their characters' goals, and having those choices impact on the direction of the game.  They don't care if they're plumbing the Caves of Chaos, or storming the Castle of Night, so long as they're doing it for some purpose they can all get behind.<br/><br/>Introducing: "Conflict resolution dungeons!" The PCs want to free the Kingdom of Lancre.  The Tyrant Wyrm wants to stop them.  Conflict! How do we resolve this conflict? A dungeon! It can be any dungeon.  It can be a random dungeon.  You could have prepped it years ago, so long as it's the right level.  All you have to do is work out some reason why this Dungeon will resolve that conflict.  Maybe the Tyrant Wyrm's enemy lives at the bottom of this dungeon, and if you can contact her, you can convince her to depose him.  Maybe the dungeon is the back way into the Wyrm's lair.  Maybe there's some artifact of great power down there.  It doesn't matter.  Maybe the PCs don't care.  Ideally, they can come up with this themselves.  They'll say "Let's find an artifact that can destroy the Tyrant" and you'll say "Great, there's one at the bottom of the Caves of Chaos" and bang, you're on the way.  Sometimes though, the PCs will want to take on a problem that's too big for them.  Simple! Make it a multi stage conflict.  First, they must take the artifact from the Caves of Chaos, then (when they're suitably leveled up) they can creep through the Howling Mines into the Tyrant Wyrm's lair.  Levelling becomes not just a grind, but a means to an ends.<br/><br/>How does this sound? Is it dumb? Or is it a cool way to a more player-driven D&amp;D?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77642/#Comment_77642" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T21:23:47+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  9:23PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I understand.<br/><br/>What do you see as the alternative to dungeons that resolve conflict?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77648/#Comment_77648" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T21:34:56+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  9:34PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, sorry, that is a little unclear.  Of course, all dungeons resolve conflicts.  They resolve the conflict "can we get whatever it is we want from the dungeon" what I'm talking about is making that process explicit.  Rather than tying a specific conflict to a specific dungeon - "I think the PCs will try and defeat the Tyrant Wyrm, so I'll prep the Wyrm's lair", the players set up a conflict, which you then resolve with a dungeon.  "We want to defeat the Tyrant Wyrm" <br/>"Ok, well, I've prepped the Caves of Chaos" <br/>"What if there's an artifact down there that can defeat the Wyrm?" <br/>"Cool, let's go!"<br/><br/>It's like, in a normal conflict resolution game, you roll dice to determine the outcome of the conflict.  In this style of play, you go into a dungeon.  Maybe some more examples would be helpful?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77650/#Comment_77650" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T21:37:40+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  9:37PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me, and is kind of what I was aiming at in Errantry, where each encounter you have is supposed to move you closer to fulfilling your overall quest.<br/><br/>"You just encountered a..."

But a definition that's specific and helps here is to say that it's taking away decisions that the players want to make. In this case, the players, by agreeing to play the "Dungeon Resolution" game, are agreeing to this resolution system like any other game. The decisions that the players want to make, and get to make in this game, are why and how it is that the dungeon in question resolves the character's problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again I would.

A good point was made, though, that the dungeon encounter is unlikely to be related to the stakes of the conflict.  Your players will be all "We want to drive the orcs out of North Woods" and they'll end up fighting Beholders in some cave somewhere.  Sure, they'll accomplish their goal, but it might feel a bit weird, especially after a few sessions of this.  I can see that being a problem.  Here are some possible solutions:<br><br>Prepping a lot of different scenarios: You've got a handful of options to choose from, so you can choose the one that matches the stakes as well as possible.  That's not an ideal solution though, because with PCs levelling like they do in 3rd ed. your prep only has a usefulness window of three or four sessions.  A whole bunch of wasted prep kind of defeats the purpose.  Modules could definitely help with this though.<br><br>Adapting your prep on the fly: It's easy to substitute orcs for gnolls, bugbears for ogres, and so on.  It's less easy to substitute Mind Flayers for Beholders, or what have you.  If you can pull a fast switch of the bad guys, this would help a lot.  It's kind of defeating the purpose though.  Maybe you could prep a few different alternatives, like writing "6 Gnolls, or 10 Orcs" in your dungeon notes, or noting the stats for an NPC as various different races.  It might be a cool way to get really unconventional NPCs - an Orc Chief who was originally an Elf Princess, for example.<br><br>Getting really good at Bullshitting: "Umm, yeah, well, the orcs are being led by a Beholder, yeah! and, this Beholder is taking orders from the main Beholder council! If the Beholders survive, they'll keep gathering orcs, no matter how many you kill. But if you can take out the Beholder Council, the orcs will scatter!" This is probably the best option.  Actually, it might be best to let the players help with the bullshitting, so everyone's on board.  Sometimes it's going to feel really forced, and then you can go with one of the above options, but I think you can go a long way with this option, and even get really cool convoluted plots into the bargain.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77966/#Comment_77966" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T19:12:24+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  7:12PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "bullshitting" option is what makes this so hot to me.

A good point was made, though, that the dungeon encounter is unlikely to be related to the stakes of the conflict.  Your players will be all "We want to drive the orcs out of North Woods" and they'll end up fighting Beholders in some cave somewhere.  Sure, they'll accomplish their goal, but it might feel a bit weird, especially after a few sessions of this.  I can see that being a problem.</br></br></blockquote>\nI think the best way to handle that is to just leave it up to the players. A "dungeon" is really just a set of challenges (monsters, traps) standing between the players and a plot device (the +5 Mystical MacGuffin, the cryptic clue uttered by the dying bad guy). If you really want to make things player-driven, have <i>them</i> come up with the plot stuff and you just concentrate on crafting a challenging dungeon (You are the <i>Dungeon</i> Master, after all! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ) for them to find it in--perhaps reserving the right to throw in some plot twists, just to keep them on their toes. <br><br>So it could be something like:<br><br>PLAYERS: "We want to kick those filthy orcs out of the North Woods!"<br>DM: "Ok, how?"<br>ROGUE: "Well, I poke around the village for a while asking questions and eventually meet this old ranger who's been spying on the orc camp. He says that every night the shaman leaves the camp and heads off towards the mysterious caves deep in the forest."<br>CLERIC: "I seem to recall a legend about an evil relic, the Tusk of the Orc God, that disappeared near here about a hundred years ago."<br>FIGHTER: "I bet it's in that cave!"<br>DM: "Ok, but if the orcs have this Tusk thingy, why are they living in a camp in the woods instead of in the cave?"<br/>ROGUE: "Obviously they <i>don't</i> have it. Someone--or some<i>thing</i>--living in that cave is using the relic to make the orcs do his evil bidding."<br/>CLERIC: "We must find this relic and destroy it!"<br/>FIGHTER: "No, you idiot, we give it to the orcs in exchange for leaving the North Woods in peace."<br/>ROGUE: "We can argue about that later. C'mon, guys, let's go check out that cave!"<br/>PLAYERS: "Yay!"<br/><br/>Now all the DM has to do is pull "Cave Full of Mosters #3" out of his notebook (or whip one up using the <a href="http://www.roleplayingtips.com/readissue.php?number=156#1" rel="nofollow">Five Room Dungeon Model</a> and off they go. No railroading, no spending half the session trying to motivate the players into going into the dungeon, just "What do you want to do? How is going into a dungeon going to help you accomplish that? Ok, let's go!"                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78067/#Comment_78067" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T09:06:35+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  9:06AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2007 9:43AM by Josh Roby.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My only caveat is determining when a dungeon is "done" and whether the players acheive their stakes or not.

Obviously this is a bigger deal for D&amp;D than other games, so I'm going to talk about D&amp;D.  <br><br>I touched on this a bit in the first post, but I think it could do with some elaboration.  <br><br>One of the other problems that people commonly encounter with D&amp;D is that levelling up makes the world all crazy.  It has to keep getting more dangerous, or else the PCs aren't being challenged.  Conversely, the players never really experience an increase in power, because they're always fighting level appropriate challenges.  <br><br>The obvious solution, using Conflict Resolution Dungeons, is to tie the scale of the conflict to the level of the dungeon.  Small, local problems are solved by level one dungeons.  World-shattering conflicts require level twenty dungeons.  <br/><br/>But that's not easy to do.  It's hard to be consistent with scale like that.  It becomes really tempting to just make any conflict around the right level for the PCs, which removes the incentive for levelling up.  Is it possible to create some hard rules about dungeon level vs. conflict level?  What about dungeon length? How many encounters makes a dungeon? Is it reasonable to one day save the world by slaying a single dragon, and the next day restore peace to the Kingdom by slogging through miles of Umber Hulk infested corridors?<br/><br/>One thing I like about the idea is that it in no way prohibits you from making a specific-use dungeon if that's your wish.  If the PCs are building up to a climactic show-down, there's nothing wrong with prepping a specific series of encounters for the final conflict.  I think the game would even benefit from that.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
