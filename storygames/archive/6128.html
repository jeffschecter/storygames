After giving this project some thought, I have decided that the project should be released under the Creative Commons License so that other people could <i>remix and redesign</i> the games to their own tastes so long as they attributed the original designesr, didn't make money from it, and published it under the same open license.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is were you come into the picture. I would like to invite the Story Games community to participate by contributing games to this project.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead more about this project here: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://those-in-peril.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">For Those In Peril</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot offer any money for games contributed to the project. However, you will be credited for the games that you contribute. You can be credited as an individual and/or as the company you use for publishing game, e.g if the esteemed Ben Lehman were to contribute a game, he could be credited for it as Ben Lehman and/or TAO Games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136617/#Comment_136617" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T05:16:07+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  5:16AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a cool idea.

Where all of the characters set their default assumptions ahead of time without knowing what the others pick then pushing the scene forward with whatever you have based your character on. It would actually be very gamist with buttons you could push and tacks you could take.

The games need to be for anyone with an interest in storytelling games and not just for experienced gamers.<br/>\n2. The games need be something that some friends can do as an when the urge strikes them.<br/>\n3. I envision people collecting only the games that they are interested. For some people that may be one or two and for other it might be the entire collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine someone new roleplaying or storytelling games wanting to try something easy to learn or a groups of veteran gamers that just want to play withot commiting themselves to a campaign or a lengthy saga. Those are the people for whom this project is aimed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rule about one scene isn't one you need to be particular strict with keeping to when designing the games. I'm using the single scene so as to keep the games duration short (preferably under an hour). But if you can design a game that can be played in under two hours and it has more than one scene then that's fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm currently working on a game for this project called "So Recently the Enemy". Its a game about three colleagues who have found a priceless artefact in an ancient ruin. One of them has this artefact, another has a gun with one bullet, and the last one knows the only safe route out of the ruin. What will follow if I design the game well is a scene about envy, jealousy, and possessiveness. And yes it was inspired by the as yet unreleased Indiana Jones movie.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">This is a cool idea. Which CC license? Do you want text files or fully laid out gamez? Should they be playtested or just thought experiments?</div>\n</blockquote>\nMy plan is to host the original ones as documents on the internet using Google Documents. From there people can do pretty much what they want with them as long as they credit the people who have worked on it and don't try to sell it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not to playtest the games is a choice that each designer has to make for themselves. Bear in mind that the games can be tweaked by anyone (including the original author) so there's no point where any game is truly finished or that there will ever be one definitive version. But that doesn't mean it can't be ready to play. I like to think of them in the same way as myths and folk tales that belong to no one and change from community to community or across time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136707/#Comment_136707" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T14:08:19+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  2:08PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2008 2:09PM by MJGraham.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the CC license I want to release these games under: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" rel="nofollow">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
