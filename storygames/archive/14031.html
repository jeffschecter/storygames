I've been using a little 12" G4 Mac laptop and I hate the form factor for the display. I'm thinking that a tablet would be more useful than my laptop.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote 1: I will NOT be getting a 3G or 4G tablet, wi-fi only. I have an iPhone 4 to cover me for any 3G/GPS/etc. needs, I have no desire nor funds to pay for another data plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote 2: I have looked at 7 inch tablets and my old eyes don't enjoy them. It will have to be a 10 inch tablet, so no Nook Color rooted for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes the tablet allow easy reference to PDFs?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's the best app to use for PDF viewing?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does a tablet work at the table vs. a laptop? Better? Neutral?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor you <b>iPad </b>lovers/users: if I want to use PDFs at a gaming table, read comics, watch movies and web surf, should I get an iPad or an iPad 2?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your <b>Android </b>tablet experts/users: If I want to use PDFs at a gaming table, read comics, watch movies and web surf, should I wait for a Honeycomb tablet or would something like a GTab or an inexpensive tablet running Android Froyo or the like work for me?<br/>\n<br/>\n*This thread is for people who have actually used a tablet at a gaming table. I'm not interested in hearing people's theories on this practice, just actual application and reflection on that actual application.

None of those things will substantially improve the experience of the activities you list (perhaps PDF pages would render faster, but I doubt you'd notice). For any of those things, a faster processor would just spend more clock cycles waiting for you to do something.<br><br>It would be a much different story if the iPad 2 would have featured a Retina display (or, at least, some sort of higher pixel density), because you'd see the difference when reading PDFs.

However, Eric succeeded on his summoning roll, so here I am!<br><br><b>iPad vs. Android<br/></b>Android's not quite there yet, and I worry it never will be, for a variety of reasons. Most tell was Google saying Android wouldn't be tablet-worthy until they released Honeycomb...and tablet makers making tablets with Android regardless. Even if such tablets can compete on price and features (not yet, really, but maybe later this year), they are woefully behind in app development. If you don't hate Apple for other reasons, the iPad is the choice to make here.<br><br><b>iPad 1 vs. iPad 2 (vs. iPad 3)</b><br>I've been using an iPad since day of release, and it's great to have at the gaming table. Last week, I got an iPad 2. I'd have a hard time recommending you buy an iPad 2 if you already own an iPad 1 (my girlfriend is hanging onto her iPad 1 and waiting for iPad 3 - more below), but if you don't own an iPad, it's (almost) a no-brainer. I say almost because just minutes ago, I read that Verizon stores were selling wifi-only iPad 1 starting at $300; entry-level (16gb wifi) iPad 1 has been $400 since iPad 2 went on sale. If cost is a major factor, you might want to scour Verizon stores near you for a $300 model.<br><br>Otherwise, get an iPad 2. For your extra money, you get twice the processing power and nine times the graphics power, front- and rear-facing cameras, 33% thinner profile, and 15% less weight. I *am* noticing speed differences between the 1 and the 2, but it's the weight and form-factor that impress me most. I'm using one of the new smart covers, where I was using either the Apple case for iPad 1 or a much larger and heavier case, and it hefts a bit closer to a Kindle, which I think is the apt comparison here. iPad 1 only feels bulky when you're holding it up to read for long periods. iPad 2 really cuts down on this. It's not perfect yet, but this was a major step in the right direction. There are some improvement in Safari, especially regarding buffering/caching pages, but most of the stuff under the hood you won't notice until devs really start to leverage the power of the 2 over the 1, which is probably months away. As with all technology, it's obsolete as soon as you buy it, so the 2 will have longer staying power than a 1 now.<br><br/>What about iPad 3? Two major factors here, both rumors. First is the "retina display," which would effective double the resolution. iPad 2 doesn't have it, but iPad 3 is expected to. Second is September. Rumor has the iPad release cycle moving to September, to join the iPod refresh. This is a big deal, as iPad 2 will only be six months old. If it's true, buying an iPad 2 right now means paying full price for a stopgap "1.5" release. If it's not, you're waiting for nothing, since iPad 2 won't change features or price miraculously in September. My thinking was that Apple products retain good resale value, so I'm "leasing" my iPad. iPad 2 was $500, and I sold my iPad 1 for $250. I expect to do the same with my iPad 2 when 3 comes out. As such, I feel like I'm paying $250+tax to lease an iPad for a year. Seems reasonable to me, YMMV.<br/><br/><b>16 GB vs. 32 GB vs 64 GB</b><br/>Both my iPads have been 16GB models. If you intend to dump a bunch of media on the device, go bigger, but I think this year is the tipping point for cloud storage and delivery, so I expect to continue leveraging the hell out of services like Dropbox. Dropbox has all my RPG PDFs. I download what I need, and I'm off to the races. Storage is more of a temporary concern for me. If your media collection is under 64 GB and you want to use the iPad to cart it around, then the extra $200 is worth it. I find I prefer the size and portability of my iPod far superior for music, and I usually watch video at home, where I have much better venues than my iPad. The more you travel, the more you might consider storage for video. Or watch Netflix or Hulu via wifi. Bottom line: I haven't *needed* more than 16 GB yet. (If apps keep getting bigger, I might eat my words. Who knows?)<br/><br/><b>Apps</b><br/>Yesterday on Twitter, someone asked for iPad apps for RPGs. I replied, "They already exist: GoodReader, Dicenomicon, and the notepad of your choice."<br/><br/>GoodReader, as has already been noted, handles PDFs, text files, MS Word docs, Excel, and several other formats. It has built-in integration with Dropbox that's so good, you may not need to install the (free) Dropbox app on your iPad. Not only can you bookmark it, you can annotate it *and* export your annotations. Let me reiterate: you can write all over your RPG book and give it to someone else to read your marginalia and doodles, all without ever damaging the value of a physical product! PDF is really the future of tabletop gaming, with the ability to update, revise, and rerelease PDFs to the consumer, without charging them a dime or costing you an arm and leg in printing costs. Great example: the Smallville RPG PDF just got an index. That means the current PDF has advantages the physical books lacks!<br/><br/>The Dicenomicon is a great dice-rolling app, with a pretty flexible dice mechanics. I haven't used it in a long while, as I'm still addicted to the tactile experience that dice represent, but I love the notion I no longer have to worry about having dice with me to sit down and break out some role-playing. Dicenomicon is also a universal app, so buy it once and load it on your iPad, iPod, and iPhone.<br/><br/>Beyond GoodReader and Dicenomicon, there are tons of note-taking apps, and that whole area is very much one of personal preference. Handwriting, dictation, embedding, syncing, compatibility, and the like will probably drive your decision-making process here. A lot of them are free or cheap, so experiment. I and Rob Donoghue have specific opinions about different apps, but I don't think either of us has found an app that stands head-and-shoulders above the rest, at least not like GoodReader does for PDFs. Worth comment are Index Cards, which is really for storyboarding screenplays but might offer interesting possibilities for low-detail characters or relationships ala Fiasco, and iCardSort, which lets you put sticky notes over your virtual surface, expanding them out to hold more details and move them around ala Danger Patrol.<br/><br/><b>At the Gaming Table</b><br/>What a tablet does well at the gaming table is consolidate information: game books, character sheets, GM notes, maps, etc. in one contained space. With multitasking on the iOS, it's pretty easy to jump between a gamebook PDF and character notes or the like, but it does take some getting used to. For a while, I had to force myself to use the iPad instead of the physical book I had sitting on the table, but it was well worth it. Leverage the hell out electronic PDF capabilities, like bookmarking and searches, and that quick hit of flipping through the book will fade. My gaming bag has never been so light: iPad, dice bag, index cards, pencils.<br/><br/>What a tablet does not do well at the gaming table is display information to others or provide a play space. Sure, you can hand it around or create messages large enough for folks on the other side of the table to read (check out Holler Gram), but I still like making sure players have got their own copy of the gametext and printouts of any relevant material. Maps are fine to look at, but the iPad is a bit small for all but the simplest of maps sitting in the middle of a very small gaming table. (I *have* used it for a 3:16 range map pretty successfully, though.) This will change if and when others at the table have their own devices, and apps exist to share and sync data easily and consistently. Until then, battle mats, minis, hand-drawn maps, and the like aren't going anywhere. Until then, the iPad is supplement to your gaming table, not a replacement of your entire gaming kit.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about specific apps and techniques to leverage a tablet at the gaming table, but this post is long enough already, and such a thread really should be an ongoing discussion. As such, I'm happy to answer questions here (if I can remember to keep coming back to this thread), or via email, chat, or Twitter. I'm semioticity in most of those places.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>MDG                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317795/#Comment_317795" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T11:47:15+00:00" title="March 25, 2011 11:47AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experiences have not been ideal!

Saved heaps of printing or us choosing beforehand.<br/><br/>I have GoodReader and it is better than the other program I bought (whatever that was) but I actually just use iBooks for my PDFs now because it does everything I want simply (YMMV). I would also recommend Dropbox if you have wifi at your gaming table.<br/><br/>I have 32 GB and 3G but I could cope pretty happily with 16 GB and wifi most of the time. I also am happy enough that I am not interested in upgrading to iPad 2. So I'd suggest not over speccing your requirements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317888/#Comment_317888" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-26T18:58:00+00:00" title="March 26, 2011  6:58PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthew, thanks for the thorough reply, this is very informative.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone else, too.
