Wow is it bad <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>.  I normalized the audio on my voice but only after I had set the volume of the music relative to the voice which made my voice quieter so the music is too loud.  And using my laptop mic was a bad, bad idea.  The part where I switch to the plugged in mic is so much better.<br/><br/>Mick -- always been a fan of your stuff.  Especially listening to your time with the Role Monkeys and your growing dissatisfaction with the type of play the other members enjoyed.  It was incredibly illuminating.  Reminded me of my own experience.  You handled it better than I did though.<br/><br/>Graham -- Glad I found the winning formula on how to make a good podcast. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>  About being interested in what comes next... I just realized that I might have a problem maintaining people's interests.  Each show is going to be about very, very different things.  For example, coming up is a show on hacking Vampire: The Requiem.  Then I've got an interview with a guy who got blind sided by a game of In A Wicked Age.  I gunned for his character with a female character who's best interest included bearing his character's children.  He's pretty much only ever played traditional games with a heavy emphasis on winning combat.  Yeah... I can be a jerk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215848/#Comment_215848" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T15:42:35+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  3:42PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lenny Balsera &amp; I have been talking about doing a podcast about game hacking for over a year now.<br/><br/>I'm glad to see this here, because it means now we don't have to.

Almost 4 years ago, I was going to be a podcaster.  Then I made an episode 0 and recorded episode 1.  In the process I realized that I hated the sound of my voice in a recording (apparently it's fairly common) and while I'm sure it's perfectly fine really, I wasn't enjoying the editing process as a result and ended up not finishing the first full length episode and cancelled the project.<br/><br/>So what's your project from a few years ago that didn't make it?<br/><br/>As for hacking games, basically what happened with me was that I hacked the crap out of D&amp;D4E and played that until we got sick of it, with every third session being an In A Wicked Age session as a break.  Then we played a bunch of Trail of Cthulhu, which we hacked down to a more manageable number of skills* and then we eventually transitioned to Cthulhu Dark.  Next week I have a Solar System post apocalyptic game starting and building the crunch for that reminds me of my Fudge days.<br/><br/>*Very simple process:  Each player picks 3-5 investigation skills that they are actually interested in and the Keeper designs the scenarios to have clues based on the group's skill sets rather than to have every skill covered across the group.  We also renamed skills as needed to broaden them.  And we did it by going around in a circle and saying "I want a game where I solve mysteries by finding clues about ancient history!" or "I want a game where I solve mysteries by finding clues through forensics!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
