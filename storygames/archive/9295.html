I never liked it.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, I love the forum, Story Games, despite the name.  This place is fun.  I dig.<br/><br/>So, let me try to put what I hate that term to words.<br/><br/>It is like calling soccer a fitness game.  "I ran around chasing this ball around and at the end I was fit!"  No, fitness just happens to be one of the many by-products of a soccer game.  It just happens when you run around on a hundred yards of field with twenty one other people.  Soccer's no fun if all you want is fitness, in order for soccer to be fun, you have to want to score a goal and you have to want to stop the other eleven folks from putting the ball in your goal.<br/><br/>Story isn't something we sit around and discuss.  It happens through play.  PLAY, dammit.  At the end, when the dice are done rolling we have a story.<br/><br/>Story is just one of the many by-products of sitting around with a bunch of friends, munching on food, pinging our fictional creations off one another's make belief stuff.  Story alone isn't fun.  Pushing a character's wants and needs or killing orcs or whatever the game encourages you to do is fun.  Story just happens as a result of that.  When you are done you often have something that is a story.<br/><br/>But the story isn't something you serve or think about or even consciously hope for.  The story just happens because you and your friends' ideas rattled around the table right along with the dice and at the end of the night some kind of pattern emerged and wham-bam-shazam now that we walk away from the table, now that I look at it, I do see we made a pleasing story out of it.<br/><br/>Don't fret on serving some story, fret on serving some play.  Think about meaningful decisions you can push your friends to make.  Daydream about nexus-point, kettle-boiling over moments and how awesome it will be when your friends have to deal with your mad, beautiful ideas and through dealing with them, change them and by changing them, make them better.<br/><br/>Am I tell you what to think?  Am I telling people who to daydream about gaming?<br/><br/>I don't know what the eff I'm doing.<br/><br/>But I do think that whatever it is I was doing, I'm now done.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205860/#Comment_205860" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T00:55:53+00:00" title="May  7, 2009 12:55AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 1:02AM by Wolfe.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Whoa, whoa, wait..</p>\n<p>If we don't call 'em Story Games, what are we going to call them?

The simple explanation for the difference is that it's about narrativism vs. simulationism, so nothing new there. "Story game" perhaps works as a term so well because it allows so many to identify with it as long as their game has some story in it somewhere. A bit like "roleplaying game" in that regard.

"D&amp;D4E is this game where you...").  Also "story games" often seems to be used to mean "these weird hippy indie games made by those designers who all know each other" and I think trying to break out of the "scene" mentality as much as possible is good for us.<br/><br/>Hey, here's <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2009/03/why-i-always-use-term-story-games.html" rel="nofollow">a post by John Harper</a> agreeing with you that intentionally seeking "story" through play is something he also dislikes.  In my mind, I think that varies for me.  I tend to invest in games at the GM-level, even when I'm just a player, where I care about how everything else works out and have a hard time focusing just on my character.  If the pacing is off or events unfold in a less-than-ideal way, it bothers me a lot.  So while I definitely think there's some potential for suck in, say, pondering "what's the coolest thing that could happen next in the story" and then making that happen every time, I don't think that story consciousness necessarily creates suck.  I just think it takes some finesse to figure out how finagle the narrative in a positive direction without forcing it to do unnatural things and while properly engaging whatever mechanics and social contract you have in place.<br/><br/>I mean, I think there's definitely an undercurrent in indie thought right now (Vincent, Harper, you, etc.) that's basically saying "Stop worrying about how the story's turning out and just play the damn game already!  The story will handle itself!"  And I think that's the pendulum swinging back from a period in which people have really worried about narrative arcs and pacing and having an overawareness of these things so they could try to "fix them" or implement them on the fly during play.  There's been a lot of focus on scene framing and figuring out what needs to happen next for the best pacing and narrative structure and my sense is that a some folks are getting sick of having to work that hard at the table and just want to throw down and play, while letting the other stuff emerge on its own.

Sometimes that is a story, sometimes it is just an idea or setting.

But if she says out loud, "hey, at the end of this session, we're going to have a big climactic battle because it would make for a more interesting story" that might upset me. Because now we've all acknowledged that there would be a big conflict no matter what we did in the past and it creates a disconnect between the narrative-so-far and the final resolution.

As far as I'm concerned, to the extent that there's a border around "story game", it's a bigger one than the one around "RPG". It contains all games with an imaginative component that rewards investment (not necessarily concretely, but in the sense that the game is more fun if you imagine what's happening). Lots of board games in the "Ameritrash" tradition qualify. Some war games qualify (there are plenty that either are too abstract to have recognizable fiction or that actively punish investment in any narrative qualities that may emerge).<br/><br/>If you define Story Game the way Vincent (in his lovable curmudgeon way) has tried to lately (no feedback from fiction to mechanics), then yeah, those mostly suck - <b>as roleplaying games</b>.

So it's not exactly like "fitness" as a consequence of soccer; it's more like the score. So while the <i>point</i> of playing is the experience of doing the things you do when you play (the love of the game, if you like), the narrative that it produces in retrospect can be given greater or lesser emphasis depending on design choices and play preferences. And those games that give greater weight to that retrospective narrative-producing character maybe <i>should</i> be called story-games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205954/#Comment_205954" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T07:22:47+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  7:22AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In other news, Bill is smarter than me.<br/><br/>Yeah, man, yeah.<br/><br/>Yeah, until the end when you trick me with your Jedi mind powers.

Before, I tried to think of "What *is* a story game, anyway?" and came away with "Oh yeah, Story Games is the name of this forum."<br/><br/>Basically, it was an ironic moniker back when there were these raging debates on the intertubes of "what is a roleplaying game"?<br/><br/>At the time, there were a lot of threads over on RPGnet to the likes of, "Oh I don't have anything against (insert game here), it's just not a <i>roleplaying</i> game. Clearly."<br/><br/>My Life with Master was not a real roleplaying game because MLWM has an endgame condition and real RPGs can't have artificial endgame conditions.<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures was not a real roleplaying game because it addressed everything in terms of the character's issue, and real RPGs have stats and skills of which your character is comprised.<br/><br/>A lof of these games don't have explicit rules for combat, or drowning, or falling (this ironic debate led eventually to the game "Drowning and Falling"), and real roleplaying games require rules, however brief, which can be utilized in these situations.<br/><br/>At that point, one dude was like, "LOL, then what do we call these games where you very clearly <b>play a role</b>, if not <b>role</b>-playing games? Fuckit, it's not even worth debating. i'm gonna call them Story Games or someshit."<br/><br/>and the name stuck.<br/><br/>For myself, I don't think I've actually used the word "Story Game" to describe an actual game for years now. I always call them RPGs, even here on this forum. The distinction of "This game, where you play a role? It's not a role-playing game, because of <i>[this arbitrary statement that describes something I personally like about the games I play]</i>" didn't hold after those debates cooled down. Any use of the word without knowing that history is probably a little ironic at this point.<br/><br/>Yet, if I were talking about RPGs to people who had no idea of the concept? I'd probably call them all "Story Games", because that term gives you an idea of how it might be different than a board game, card game or video game. But I haven't been in such a situation since I left Japan. For example, at work recently, someone mentioned D&amp;D. I threw out a joke, one thing led to another, and about 7 people in my group from all ages and backgrounds were talking about how they played this or that. The 50-year old dude in computer storage engineering used to be in a Shadowrun game. The manager over there played a few times in high school. So while I keep that term "Story Games" as a potentially useful tool to describe these games in my Metaphorical Toolbox, I've never really had to reach for it. I mean, who are we kidding, if you found your way here, you understand what RPGs are, and understand that games from Cyberpunk 2020 to Bacchanal, from 1st edition AD&amp;D to Grey Ranks are all games where you play a role and do stuff.<br/><br/>Anyway, just wanted to throw some history in there. While we all know that these games are RPGs, there's a lot of new faces here that might not know where the term story game came from.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>*Clinton                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205981/#Comment_205981" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T08:02:40+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  8:02AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw the term "story game" used in one of the <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=9908" rel="nofollow">First Person</a> / <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11000" rel="nofollow">Second Person</a> journal-style books, recently.

Because we take roles in a story, and it is a game because there are rules (+ the interpretation) that can take the story (and OUR roles ) in unexpected directions. <br/><br/>Story Play Games might work for me, but probably not.  AFter all, a game could be (and has been) devised where Stories are made, but the players don't have Roles.  A game where story elements are introduced out of hat randomly and each player must fit it into the narrative.  Doesn't have to have  a Role associated with it.  <br/><br/>And certainly what we do is Play.  I love the Play part.  <br/><br/>But humans like to categorize.  I mean, we have Art Noveau and we have Art Deco.  I know the difference... but both are art, both revolve heavily around detail and pattern.  But both have more in common with each other than with Impressionism.... despite that Impressionist era being bracketed by Noveau and Deco.   I sorta feel like the next gen of role playing games often called Story Games for a lack of a better handle and they are SOOO freakin related, it is almost not worth describing one as a Role Playing Game and one has a Story Game.  Disco is still a form of  Rock n Roll.  Can't say Disco is classical music or folk or blues (despite probably borrowing from all of them, certainly classical.... but then again, so does Rock n Roll).  <br/><br/>So, yeah, don't love the handle... but it has gone on to mean something as the English language is always shifting, always evolving.  Just take a look at the original meaning of fag or bitch or that email is now a word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206019/#Comment_206019" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T09:18:13+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  9:18AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 9:24AM by Brand_Robins.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate all terms for all things I do. <br/><br/>I do not fit in a box!<br/><br/>Unless you chop off my arms and legs, of course.<br/><br/>I also hate: Indie Games, Roleplaying Games, Board Games, and so on.

And by "game," I mean "instance of play," not "set of written rules."<br/><br/><b>Cloud game: </b>We're playing D&amp;D 4E. Our characters are traversing a great desert via a broken down causeway of sorts. There used to be a huge lake here or something. Daniel is running it all as a giant skill challenge. <i>We don't even really know what the stakes are</i>, but it isn't that important this time. We run into obstacles and challenges and organically figure out what our characters do. For example, when I come to the broken bridge, I want to use my cool Shadow Bridge ritual, even though I know I have an outsider's chance at pulling off the success. I spend ten minutes casting the spell with the aid of the shaman and fail. Daniel marks down a failure but he interprets that as making my bridge narrow and shaky. We have to move our slowly growing army single file across it and it slows us down. While I'm working up my ritual, the apelord meets the disembodied spirit of some kind of proto-bullywug. There is real conversation between Joe, the apelord's player, and Daniel, playing the bullywug. After a while, the role-play comes to a natural pause. Daniel asks for a Diplomacy roll. It isn't the best skill for Joe's character, but who cares. He gets the success. <br/><br/><b>Box game: </b>I'm running 4E. It's my adaptation of HBO's "The Wire" for fantasy. The PCs are detectives and cops dealing with fantasy city crimes and gangs. They have apprehended a mid-level gang boss and want to question him. I use a skill challenge. We go around the table, each player contributing a roll: either a success or failure toward the skill challenge. <br/><br/>Me: "Daniel, what do you do?" <br/>Daniel checks his skill list: "I'm gonna get in his face and threaten bodily harm, maybe throw him against the wall. That's Intimidation, right?"<br/>Me: "Roll it."<br/>Daniel rolls and succeeds by a fair margin.<br/>Me: "The perp loses his breath as his back hits the wall. 'What the fuck, man? Shiiiit. You don't hafta be all up in my face.' He's not spilling yet, but it's clear he's shaken."<br/>And so on, for each player.<br/><br/>In the cloud game, play flows almost entirely from the fiction. The rules present themselves at obvious points. Surely they're in the back of the player's head ("My apelord is bad at diplomacy, but good at intimidation...") but those things tend to be filtered through the headspace of the character ("I am not good at diplomacy, but I can intimidate him, if that presents itself as a reasonable option...").<br/><br/>In the box game, play flows almost entirely from the rules and stats. What is the best or most reasonable tactical option? What rules options are there? <br/><br/>Daniel was DMing and we had captured this giant steampunk war engine and put it out in the middle of our battle, but it didn't work very well. I wanted to use my<i> mage hand </i>to make it EXPLODE on our enemy. The rules didn't really say I could do that, but Daniel thought it was AWESOME so he let it happen. That is more in alignment with "cloud game" play, as I'm describing it. In "box game" play, it's outside the scope of the rules, and is most likely impossible -- not because the DM is a douchebag or anything, but because the players agree that<i> the rules are the physics</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206051/#Comment_206051" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T10:41:10+00:00" title="May  7, 2009 10:41AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, that's not quite true of Box Game stuff.

We have a well-understood border between the two.<br/><br/>Role-playing game: focus is on the player's investment in his character. The player advocates on behalf of his character's interests, from his character's POV. The system supports actor-stance decisions predominantly, although some authorial tools might sneak in there. So like BW is, for us, clearly an RPG even though there are authorial procedures baked right in.<br/><br/>Story-game: focus is on the player's participation in the emerging, shared story, and the system supports that. So rather than advocating for any given character's interests, the players advocate for their own dramatic interests. So Dust Devils is, for us, on the story-game side of the equation since you're focused on The End.<br/><br/>I know this is by no means universal, and there's a BIIIIIG swath of gray between the two, but there's a tipping point: on one side you care about your character's well-being, on the other you care about good drama.<br/><br/>Shorthand: when I say "story game" to my folks, it means "games where you fuck yourself because it makes for a better story" and when I say "RPG," it means "games where you fight tooth and nail to succeed, because succeeding is awesome."<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206081/#Comment_206081" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T12:01:59+00:00" title="May  7, 2009 12:01PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Cloud game: We're playing D&amp;D; 4E. Our characters are traversing a great desert via a broken down causeway of sorts. There used to be a huge lake here or something. Daniel is running it all as a giant skill challenge. We don't even really know what the stakes are, but it isn't that important this time. We run into obstacles and challenges and organically figure out what our characters do. For example, when I come to the broken bridge, I want to use my cool Shadow Bridge ritual, even though I know I have an outsider's chance at pulling off the success. I spend ten minutes casting the spell with the aid of the shaman and fail. Daniel marks down a failure but he interprets that as making my bridge narrow and shaky. We have to move our slowly growing army single file across it and it slows us down. While I'm working up my ritual, the apelord meets the disembodied spirit of some kind of proto-bullywug. There is real conversation between Joe, the apelord's player, and Daniel, playing the bullywug. After a while, the role-play comes to a natural pause. Daniel asks for a Diplomacy roll. It isn't the best skill for Joe's character, but who cares. He gets the success.<br/>\n<br/>\nBox game: I'm running 4E. It's my adaptation of HBO's "The Wire" for fantasy. The PCs are detectives and cops dealing with fantasy city crimes and gangs. They have apprehended a mid-level gang boss and want to question him. I use a skill challenge. We go around the table, each player contributing a roll: either a success or failure toward the skill challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: "Daniel, what do you do?"<br/>\nDaniel checks his skill list: "I'm gonna get in his face and threaten bodily harm, maybe throw him against the wall. That's Intimidation, right?"<br/>\nMe: "Roll it."<br/>\nDaniel rolls and succeeds by a fair margin.<br/>\nMe: "The perp loses his breath as his back hits the wall. 'What the fuck, man? Shiiiit.

He's not spilling yet, but it's clear he's shaken."<br/>\nAnd so on, for each player.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nTo me, what you describe isn't so much "one uses the fiction and the other does not" as it is a difference in the points of view of the characters.  In literary terms, your cloud game takes place from the first-person POV -- players speak <i>as</i> their characters rather than <i>through</i> them; your box game description is classic third-person POV.  It removes the players from inside the characters heads and allows them to narrate the physical rather than the mental (with digressions into the mental, I'm sure, as they arise).  Both are inherently part of the fiction, but they're simply filtered through the players in a different manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, though, I still don't understand what the difference is supposed to be.

I just read the thread on <i>anyway</i>. No one is talking about playing characters who aren't part of the fiction. We're talking about how we do things procedurally in the game. Yes, of <i>course</i> "both [kinds of games] are inherently part of the fiction, but they're simply filtered through the players in a different manner." I'm saying that, I think.<br><br>I don't want to get into a position where I'm trying to explain what Vincent is saying cuz I might get it wrong and put words in his mouth. Let's talk about what I'm saying, assume I owe Vincent some serious credit for my ideas, and forget Vincent said anything. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> If you're curious about what Vincent is talking about, go listen to him talk or ask him questions on his thread.<br><br>What I'm saying:<br><br>I have two different modes of play. I have seen other people play in these two modes, too.<br/><br/><b>My Clouds and Boxes</b><br/><br/>First let me talk about two things. I shall call them the cloud and the boxes. <br/><br/>The cloud is a person's understanding of the fiction. Some people call it SIS (shared imagined space). The cloud isn't the actual fiction itself, because there is no such thing, except as an ideal. Every player has her own cloud, and when things are going well at the table, everyone's clouds overlap a whole lot, and the non-overlapping bits don't mess anything up. <br/><br/>The boxes are things like rules and dice. Things we can see and touch. Things that are difficult to argue with. Referents. I'm not talking about the interpretation of these things, because we can certainly argue about what a passage in the text <i>means</i>, or what rolling a 1 when sneaking up on the guard <i>means</i>. No one is going to argue that the text does not literally have certain words though. No one is going to argue that that "1" isn't a 1. No one is going to argue that my character sheet says I'm trained in Diplomacy and (my character sheet says ) I have a +8 in that skill.<br/><br/><b>Two Play Modes</b><br/><br/>Okay, so there are two modes of play. Maybe more! But two I care about here. <br/><br/>First, there's box-driven play. Here, the real-world stuff is the engine for play. When faced with a game decision, you as a player first look at the boxes, the real stuff, and make decisions that way. You need to get past this guard. You have a +8 Diplomacy but a -1 Intimidation. You choose to be diplomatic rather than scary. <br/><br/>Or, there's cloud-driven play. Here, the imagined stuff is the engine for play. When faced with a game decision, you as a player first look at the clouds, the made-up stuff, and make decisions that way. You need to get past this guard. He's a Cimmerian, and you don't like Cimmerians. You ask him nicely to let you through and he insults your heritage as he denies you.

This is my paraphrasing of what Vincent was getting at.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>A lot of games assume that the rules and the fiction are unrelated. Whatever. We're past that. See: WoD, D&amp;D when you're trying to seduce the witch queen. None of us here are doing this.</p>\n<p>Many games have rules that affect the fiction, but the fiction doesn't really affect the procedures. See, Shock: resolution (barring the part where the Antag player is implicitly asking you what resources you want to use), Misspent Youth, In a Wicked Age... and many other games of those and subsequent generations.</p>\n<p>Few games have fiction that affects the rules in an untainted way. That's what he's after. He wants fictional events to pertain directly to the rules. That's the "rightward pointing arrow", where you say, "I put my back to the glare of the Hot Moon" or "I cut my hair to look like his son so he hesitates", and from those you gain an advantage, disadvantage, whatever, mechanically.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>The "cloud" is the fiction. It's a cloud because that's what people use to represent abstract ideas. That's why "THE INTERNET" is a cloud on network diagrams. Because it's not a thing. It's stuff that has come into existence through consensus. No one has exactly the same picture in their head as anyone else, but that's true of all communication. It's important to note that the GM's internal thought processes \u2014 "Dan's totally gonna fuck a goat" \u2014 aren't true until they come into existence through the application of System (the rules, including the unspoken ones, that say what's really true in the fiction). It's on the left because that's where Vincent drew it the first time.</p>\n<p>The "boxes" are dice, but Vincent just stopped drawing the dots on them. They represent procedures. Rules. Principled decisions about what's true in the fiction. It's on the right because that's where Vincent drew it.</p>\n<p>In some old diagrams, Vincent used to draw smiley faces that represented the players, but those are implicit. All this is stuff that the players are doing anyway.</p>\n<p>See, what happened was, a lot of us (I'm totally part of this party) looked at the Czege Principle (it's not fun to make up your own challenges) and the Impossible Thing Before Breakfast (It's not possible to be simultaneously referee and opposition), and said, "Screw that! Let's commoditize the GM's resources so they can fight as hard as they want to without having that conflict of interest!"</p>\n<p>The problem is that an unexpected side effect is that you wind up dealing with the commodities rather than the fiction. It doesn't always happen, and there are certainly techniques that players use to stay on task, but it's <em>hard</em>.</p>\n<p>So what Vincent's trying to do is, rather than separate "referee" and "opposition" as many of us have done, he's eliminating the "simultaneously". When you develop a situation, a monster, a set piece, you take care to make them beautiful. Then, when play has started, you put that down, like you put down your own judgments on a town in Dogs in the Vineyard, and you reveal the world faithfully, including the degree of challenge being represented.</p>\n<p>In both Storming the Wizard's Tower and Apocalypse World, he's developing procedures to make sure those interests are not in conflict. That's what he's talking about. I'm working on it with Xenon: too. I think sorting out those issues will lead to greater beauty and immersion, and that's something we're drawing from the Jeepformers.</p>\n<p>(Also, Vincent says it's not a story game because he's being comically crabby about it. He's come up with his own definition, which is where all the arrows point left, but really, that's his own personal distinction. Personally, I use "fiction games" because you're making a whole hunk of fiction \u2014\xa0not just a "story", but people, things, events. When we look back, we see a story, but the entire time, what we're waist deep in is the <em>fiction</em>.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206208/#Comment_206208" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T20:17:45+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  8:17PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">First, there's box-driven play.

I understand now much better what's being discussed (especially when reference can be made to Cimmerians during the explanation).  From my own experience, the stats and skills and feats and what-not-fiddly-bits represent the skeleton of the character.  These are the bones upon which we hang the flesh of personality.  With my regular group we take the time to make sure our conception of the character -- the picture in our minds eye -- matches the underlying skeleton.  If the character is rippling with muscle, then he or she had best have a commensurate strength score; if they deign use descriptors such as swift or smart, then unless they're being ironic the numerical physiology must match the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, if it were our regular DM adjucating your cloud scenario he'd not be quite so forthcoming with a bonus: in our mode of play, a -1 intimidation score would mean that, no matter what, that character is physically incapable of intimidating much more than a small child.  And then only if a scary mask were involved.  Nevermind that the character could perhaps lay waste to a village of Cimmerians.  So, he'd be forced to find another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally get that there are as many ways to play as there are gamers.  It's cool to see how others do it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206222/#Comment_206222" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T23:25:42+00:00" title="May  7, 2009 11:25PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

The player is taking the advantage of high ground. The high ground is real in the fiction and the +2 is real in the rules.This is related to Luke Crane's "The Setting is part of the system" assertion, which I've never felt in conflict with at all. It's just hard to figure out how to make it a<em>functional</em>part of the system. I think we're starting to work that out.</blockquote>\nYeah, exactly. It seems like the stuff Ryan Stoughton is talking about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9288&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">over here</a> is about getting a die for making a declaration in the fiction, where the higher ground example is like a widget that already exists and is being pulled out of the collective fiction for a mechanical bonus.

While the word "fiction" certainly has a different connotation than "story", given the context of RPG (or RPG-ish) play we're assuming here, I think the implication of "story" is pretty clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I like the phrase and I think it expresses something that's hard to express otherwise, but whatever. Languages live. If I recall, Andy's original meaning of "Story Game" was the superset of RPGs and whatever the hell else we're doing, including Ron's "Story Now activities", <em>Once Upon a Time</em>, and other related things. So it's wandered quite a bit already.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9295/i-dont-like-the-term-story-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9295/i-dont-like-the-term-story-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9295/i-dont-like-the-term-story-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9295%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9295%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
