It was a great success. I thought I'd share. <br/><br/>We made a hack of the Cthulhu Dark system for a medieval fantasy setting -- we call it Overdeath Megakill. Our amendments to the original system are as follows:<br/><br/>-- Instead of an insanity die, there is a hero die.<br/>-- You may roll the hero die everytime your action is a life or death situation.  <br/>-- If you fail in a life or death situation, you die.<br/>-- If you choose not to use your hero die in a life and death situation, and you "succeed," you accomplish your goal, but you die a glorious death. <br/>-- Fighting a monster is always a life or death situation. <br/>-- When fighting a monster, it is always "more interesting if you fail." The GM may roll 1d6, 2d6, or 3d6 depending on the badassitude of the monster. <br/>-- If you succeed in a life or death situation, you succeed in your goal, you live, and you "level up." <br/>-- You start at level one. If you make it to level 6, then you are a hero! You may use your hero die on normal rolls, and you may retire to safety if you choose (you should probably retire pretty soon). <br/> <br/>In our session, everyone died two or three times in the course of about 3 hours. The highest level anyone reached was 4. A dwarf was eaten by a Minoboar (a big dude with a boar head); a jester was slimed by a slug; a vagabond was arrowed by bandits; a gypsy fell and was impaled on a dragon's artistic bone sculpture at the bottom of a pit; and, the angered dragon ate a nudist half dwarf. <br/><br/>It was fun -- you really start to get attached to the characters that survive a few times, so every roll is exciting. The general style of the game was that new quests were around every corner. They kept running into clues about treasures to find and people to rescue and mysteries to solve constantly . . . then they would die en route. :P                    </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416660/#Comment_416660" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T12:01:07+00:00" title="June 19, 2013 12:01PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds quite amusing!

My original intention was actually to "play it straight." I wanted to do a somewhat serious story with a high risk of death. But, I didn't really express that clearly, and the first crew of characters my group put together was pretty gonzo, so I just stayed with the comedy death montage tone. I'd still like to try it again sometime with a less silly vibe.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416664/#Comment_416664" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T12:30:34+00:00" title="June 19, 2013 12:30PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hooray!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416697/#Comment_416697" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T06:24:28+00:00" title="June 20, 2013  6:24AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds...amazing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/brunobord" title="brunobord"><img alt="brunobord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/nF7O8NB7A2O3Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/brunobord">brunobord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416721/#Comment_416721" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T12:28:33+00:00" title="June 20, 2013 12:28PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That looks like a pretty fantastic hack.

In the fiction, he was enraged and wanted to dramatically attack a bandit leader who was surrounded by dozens of armed minions (the bandit leader had just killed his sister). <br/><br/>I don't know. I might not have worded the rule well. Basically, there are three options when you are facing a life or death situation: <br/><br/>1) roll your hero die along with your normal dice (i.e. 1d6 for doing something a human can do; 2d6 if the thing is also part of your profession). You might level up, but you might die. <br/><br/>2) you can generally flee or hide or something just like normal Cthulhu Dark without risk of death (but you also forsake the possibility of leveling up). <br/><br/>3) you can accept certain death. <br/><br/>In Cthulhu Dark, the rule is "if you fight a monster, you die." I've had players do that in Cthulhu Dark anyway to fun dramatic effect. So, now that I'm thinking about it, I like the idea of keeping the voluntary destruction option. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if I like my current thing for reaching "level 6." I feel like something cool should happen. Any alternative ideas? <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416727/#Comment_416727" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T14:13:05+00:00" title="June 20, 2013  2:13PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A rather simple and boring solution might be that you work towards earning a new die.<br/><br/>The first die was the "Hero" die, and now you can use it all the time.<br/><br/>Maybe the next die is a "Wealth" die, or a "Magic" die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416729/#Comment_416729" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T14:32:21+00:00" title="June 20, 2013  2:32PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My original thought was that from that point forward you get 2d6 for doing things within human capabilities instead of 1d6. So, a character who "became a hero" would potentially be able to roll 3d6 in a normal situation (2d6 + 1d6 for profession), and 4d6 in a life or death situation (2d6 for being alive 1d6 for the profession 1d6 for the hero die). <br/><br/>But, I changed it to the current version because I didn't want characters to get harder to kill. In a game called Overdeath Megakill, it should not get easier to survive. :P                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
