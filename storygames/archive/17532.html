So I knew there were some that were railroady, some that were chokepointy, and some that were neither. I thought, wouldn't it be interesting to go back through and try to figure out how many modules contained chokepoints or railroads and how many didn't?<br/><br/>But when I started to go through and analyze, I was a bit stymied, so I'm coming to the thread a bit puzzled where to go next. Maybe the people who were discussing it want to discuss it again and we can settle on some kind of methodology for looking at this.<br/><br/>* Call of Cthulhu gives clear instructions on making investigators and people who want to investigate and dig into things. I think we have to exclude situations where the characters would just Refuse The Call, so to speak. It's not likely that someone sitting down to play a CoC module who followed the instructions on making characters would do that.<br/><br/>* Interestingly, Call of Cthulhu modules almost universally give clear "failure states"  - you don't figure out the mystery, okay, that's fine, you see in the newspaper where a bunch more people get killed and you never get to the bottom of it, but you SOMEHOW KNOW aaaaaagh my SANITY.  And that's a pretty Lovecraftian ending, so I'm cool with that.  But at the same time I don't really think this excuses a chokepoint in a module. Just because the game doesn't break down if you "lose" doesn't mean that it's a good idea to have a singular "make or break" roll in the middle of the game (especially a flat percentile roll without much in the way of situational modifiers supported in the system).  (There are a couple of modules where there are failure states that involve the destruction of humanity - these are clearly aberrations, uh, so to speak.)<br/><br/>So here is my first glance at the scenarios in the 5e rulebook (1992):<br/><br/>The Edge of Darkness: An aged dude asks the investigators to get rid of a monster in an old house.  Can't find any railroading or chokepoints. It's essentially a location adventure. Everything you need is in the location and no rolls are necessary to find any of the necessary clues, you get them going into the right place.<br/><br/>The Haunting (this is what used to be called The Haunted House in earlier editions): A landlord asks the characters to look into an old house where a creepy old wizard died.  It has an interesting suggestion: if the characters don't do research, and decide to just rush straight to the house, the Keeper should "caution" them, but let them do it.  I like that there's a "shady grifter investigators" option: If they just dig around a little, then go to the landlord and say everything's cool, the guy is killed when spending a night in the house to make sure, and he gets murdered, and one or more of the player characters may be suspected.  There's a lot of "if the players look here, they get X" (where X is sometimes "nothing"), but no clear path through the scenario.<br/><br/>The Madman: A crazy old hermit has taken up with aliens and a newspaperman has disappeared with weird lights in the sky.  There's a near-chokepoint/magician's force. If the characters make a Spot Hidden roll in the newspaperman's lodgings, they find a scratchpad with the name of the crazy old hermit. "If the investigator's miss this clue, have someone else in town mention that Oldman McHermit lives closer to the fires than anyone else; maybe he knows something."  I have a hard time toting up if this should count or not, because it's not really a chokepoint or a railroad, once the characters are pushing towards the town, the hermit is the pretty obvious direction (there are no red herrings in this adventure, in other words). <br/><br/>Anyway, because I was puzzled on how to "score" this analysis, I decided I would take a break. I have a metric buttload of Call of Cthulhu modules on my shelf, and I'm interested in working out traits they might have, but I'm not sure how to proceed. HEeeeeelp!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397556/#Comment_397556" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T21:58:03+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  9:58PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, I am so in.

Got a review to do by Friday, then a book o'scenarios to do a once over editing / proofing pass by Thanksgiving, so just what I can remember without looking up one of the <i><b>many</b></i> scenarios:<br/><br/>1. Masks of Nyarlathotep is, IMAO, a beautiful case of not railroading. I may need to reread to confirm that. But, the choke point I cringe at comes about not because of railroading but because -- atypically for this campaign -- in one place, there is only one way to do a very important thing, on the Find the Plot / Core Clue level, and it requires reading the scenario author's mind -- or the Keeper to go, "That sucks" and add a few more ways to find the information. You need to know that to find a lead, you have to look for people in the appropriate museum departments, which is totally non-intuitive, although the Investigators may be used to considering museums on their "where to do research list" by then, make your way to the right person, and figure out the right approach to use, all with absolutely no help from the author. Otherwise, well, I guess you don't find a huge chunk of plot and spend at least one full session, if not more, with no idea of what to do. (I really must listen to podcasts of groups going through this to see how it's handled.)<br/><br/>2. Someone once complained about a scenario where, having found about three separate types of journals, the Investigators have to figure out that they still need to look for a Dream Journal -- all from the same guy. If they don't figure it out, things come to a crashing halt. I'm guessing this refers to Spawn of Azathoth. Now, while I discovered that this is actually realistic, all these different types of journals -- I did a quick inventory of all the different types of journals I kept, how widely they were scattered in the apartment, and so on -- having a scenario come to a crashing halt sucks. I think what one does here is assume a full search will turn up all the goodies, because this is the beginning of the campaign, and they Investigators need their leads. I did the Spot Hidden rolls as "Who got the best one? Okay, you're the one who finds the clue."<br/><br/>3. Tatters of the King. I love, love, love this campaign. I ran it twice. I'm kind of itching to run it again. It has kickass set pieces. The author totally gets what I love about the Hastur mythos. The author totally gets how human beings who are cultists act. The author explains battle tactics of spellcasters so that I know what I'm doing. The author calibrates so that, while it is possible to kill off one or all of the Investigators, the odds are really good that a party will be able to see the campaign through to its bitter, bitter end.<br/><br/>BUT. Okay, first of all, ignore the stuff near the end about running certain things until the <i>players</i> are bored and frustrated, unless you are very, very certain your group likes that sort of thing. And, the stitching between those wonderful set pieces leave much to be desired. At one point, there's nothing the Investigators can do until an NPC they've never heard of writes them a letter from out of the blue telling them to do something -- and they have no reason to trust this person. There's a place they're supposed to be totally unable to break into until the plot says, "Okay, time to break into this place." There's a yearlong gap during which time the Investigators aren't supposed to be able to do anything until they receive another letter. My theory about this gap is that it was added to give Investigators a chance to recover from potential battle wounds, both mental and physical. I did a lot of prep when I ran this one to make sure that the Investigators didn't have to sit and twiddle their thumbs until the clue dispenser coughed up the next thing. (I wrote about running that on Yog-sothoth.net.)<br/><br/>I'm sure I could find more, given time to dedicate to this, and I'm sure I could talk about scenarios that are really good. There are also scenarios that read like recipes for more advanced chefs than I. Fr'ex, I've played in "Funkuthlhu", and I've read it.  It worked just fine (presuming you want to play a Call of Cthulhu scenario as if it were a blaxploitation film), but I am not sure I could make it work. I see the scenario. I know everything's there. But I don't see how to make the cake.<br/><br/>I can think of very few bad CoC games I've played at conventions. Oh, there are some, and sometimes, railroading is an element of that. Chokepoints generally aren't. In two cases, I was less than thrilled by the way the scenario was run. In one of those cases, there was a little too much of the GM breaking into out of character humor and a little too much of his pulling his hair to try to figure out how to get the group together when, really, all he has to do is say, "Okay, you're all together here when the scenario starts." Dude, I'm not gonna argue about that. You don't have to ask me where my character is and rack your brains trying to figure out how to get her from the library to the quad. The other was a scenario that was partly for laughs and partly serious, and I don't think the author got the blend right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397583/#Comment_397583" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T08:00:16+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  8:00AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2012 8:00AM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess my more specific question is "how do I distinguish magician's-force from having many sources for important knowledge"?

In that case I would not even be mad if they got it one way or another and more annoyed if it could only be had with a certain roll and if that fails the scenario does. Ideally it would work without any certain clue and even the worst investigators could come to some kind of ending.<br/>Other people approaching lovecraftian or at least Call of Cthulhuian Systems seem to agree. Cthulhu Dark and Trail of Cthulhu both tell you to always give out the needed clue for the story to progress and maybe update it by rolls. Which makes sense for certain investigative adventures. So if a CoC module gives the clue to the players one way or another, that does not seem to different or bad, it just avoids the chockepoint and lets them continue. Using a more traditional game approach (magician's choice).<br/>I think some of the railroading in written CoC grows from the importance of pacing in horror and the author trying to transfer the pacing how he or she imagines it at the table to paper. Some scenarios really lose lots of appeal if the pacing changes in a major way. But writing a roleplaying module that makes the GM understand the needed pace and gives the characters all the freedom can be rather hard. Many CoC scenarios just give the outlines and let the GM and players handle that issue at the table. Which can ask to much of some groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397598/#Comment_397598" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T11:32:37+00:00" title="November 15, 2012 11:32AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I happen to have <i>just</i> been reading Delta Green. I don't know if this stuff counts as quintessentially Cthulhu to you, but to me it's exactly what I've come to expect of the game: absolutely amazing flavour and literary values, coupled with essentially static and linear adventure design. For a gamer like me who prizes interaction above pretty much everything else this stuff is painful to read.<br/><br/>For example, check this out, I'll list a couple of most annoying details in the first sample adventure, "Puppet Shows and Shadow Plays". The adventure is in no way exceptional in the CoC culture of module writing, I think, and it is featured as a suitable adventure scenario to start your campaign with. This is how the module author Adam Scott Glancy railroads us:<ul><li>The scenario involves a car buried in the Arizona desert. The investigators might or might not choose to do a helicopter survey (and Spot Hidden rolls) to find the partially exposed car. If they don't, or miss it, then NPCs will find the car automatically the next day. To me this indicates that the writer is not willing or able to play dynamically on even on such minor issues as conjunctive clues that by themselves are secondary to the plot; he has to go through the motions of sort of playing the game, but really he's just running a cutscene the players will get no matter what they do.</li><li>The first combat encounter with the Traveler (the monster of the week) is described like this: "The Keeper should take this opportunity to demonstrate how deadly the combination of the Traveler and Emanuel Santana is, but you shouldn't wipe the investigators out." The text goes on to describe in detail how the tactical situation shold play out, ending with the escape of the Traveler. This reads to me, again, as a blatant abrigation of any responsibilities one might think that a GM has towards actually running an interactive game where events unfurl dynamically.</li><li>The Traveler's spaceship is taken by the local police department no matter what the investigators do. Fair enough, but again we learn immediately that this has a plot-related reason instead of just being how the setting works: the people with the ship all die horribly the next night, so apparently the writer doesn't want the investigators to be there. Again the writer is unwilling to let the bones fall as they may, as he wishes to postpone the final confrontation between the investigators and the threat.</li><li>The centerpiece of the adventure is when the investigators organize a full-blown manhunt for the Traveler and its mortal shell. "Encourage the players to draw up their plans." and so on; little may the players suspect that apparently nothing they do at this juncture will affect the success of the manhunt. It's all the same stuff we get all the time in CoC, a ritual of immersion into what it's like to be a FBI agent. The Traveler will apparently be found and the next scene will commence regardless of player performance here.</li><li>The description of the final showdown begins: "The Keeper should craft the firefight with Santana to meet the abilities of the investigators." I read this to mean that again, the writer has no intention to actually play ball with the players; he's there to provide an exciting story, so let's pretend for a bit that what you say on your side of the table actually matters - it doesn't, but you get to roll the dice and speak now and then. As an example of the advice here, the writer authors the GM to use any available NPCs present as "bullet-stoppers" to demonstrate how lethal the enemy is without actually killing a player character. This is not how the CoC combat rules tell me they work.</li><li>Interestingly the one place in the adventure where it would be totally cool to say that you've got a cutscene doesn't get one: after everything's happened the investigators are approached by a member of Delta Green about the investigators joining the eponymous conspiracy. The writer spends several paragraphs figuring out what to do if the players say no. He even says that it's pretty much the premise of the Delta Green campaign that PCs will join Delta Green, but he can't for some reason just say that this is what's going to happen. It's probably some hangup about how it's mandatory to let players make their characters do whatever the player wants, but at the same time the GM gets to completely determine what consequences (if any) those actions might have.</li></ul>\n(We could quibble about what "railroading" means, I imagine, but I don't quite feel like it now. If you think that I have such a wide definition of railroading that my examples don't count, then fair enough. For my own purposes it suffices that these types of techniques, whatever name we might use, exemplify a static attitude towards roleplaying, with no room for genuine interaction where the players as well as the GM determine the course of play.)<br/><br/>To be entirely fair to the adventure, I should note that after the final showdown the writer does allow actual play to determine the ultimate fate of the Traveler: it might escape to continue its murder spree in a different part of the country, or the investigators might succeed in killing and stopping it. I'm not entirely sure why this part is not scripted, but I suspect that the reason is simply that this work, as so many others, is written as a railroad not out of malice but rather due to a failure of technique. The scenario-writer has exactly one place in the adventure where giving a genuine choice with actual consequences does not force him to split his linear narrative, and that's at the end of the piece: whatever happens then is no longer his problem, he doesn't need to write a detailed description of it. So I suspect that the author railroads out of habit and because he doesn't know how to write an adventure without making it a prose narrative; if he could, he probably would allow other situations aside from the very last one to play out freely, too. Of course truly free play would require reworking parts of the adventure, dependent on consequential events as it is.<br/><br/>Again, I don't think that the adventure I cite here is particularly exceptional in this regard, this sort of stuff has been all over the CoC stuff I read. To me it reads basically as an instituted method of adventure-writing. It's just the only way these guys know how to write an adventure, so this is what they do. I don't even believe that they run these games as linearly as they present them on paper. It's just that their cultural context prevents them from phrasing the venues of freedom adequately while simultaneously actually communicating how their adventure runs.<br/><br/>It is also important to note that not all CoC adventures are railroads. "Haunted House", which Jason mentions, is not like that. These non-linear investigatory adventures make more sense to me as a gamer, but they have their own issues that have been widely discussed. For example, when I ran the Haunted House for some gamers two years back we had to quit out of frustration without ever getting anywhere, all simply because the players spent their time investigating the wrong things (the crazy former resident who knew nothing) and never happened to go down into the basement. I'm sure that these are solvable issues, either by rules or different GMing technique.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397599/#Comment_397599" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T11:32:46+00:00" title="November 15, 2012 11:32AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, to clarify for those who come to the discussion late: I have no moral argument against this type of roleplaying.

I'm not entirely sure why this part is not scripted, but I suspect that the reason is simply that this work, as so many others, is written as a railroad not out of malice but rather due to a failure of technique.</blockquote>\nI think the clue might be in the history of Call of Cthulhu modules, where every single one has a "what happens if you fail" section at the end!\n<blockquote><br/>It is also important to note that not all CoC adventures are railroads. "Haunted House", which Jason mentions, is not like that. These non-linear investigatory adventures make more sense to me as a gamer, but they have their own issues that have been widely discussed. For example, when I ran the Haunted House for some gamers two years back we had to quit out of frustration without ever getting anywhere, all simply because the players spent their time investigating the wrong things (the crazy former resident who knew nothing) and never happened to go down into the basement. I'm sure that these are solvable issues, either by rules or different GMing technique.<br/></blockquote>\nIn a way, I wonder about this, because don't the failure state instructions just indicate "yep, you failed at this module, better luck next time".  I understand that might be disappointing, as all losses in all games are disappointing, but it seems to be a different complaint.  The module does tell you how to move forward: you end the scenario and penalize the characters for not going into the basement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397606/#Comment_397606" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T12:46:10+00:00" title="November 15, 2012 12:46PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Cthulhu Dark and Trail of Cthulhu both tell you to always give out the needed clue for the story to progress and maybe update it by rolls.</blockquote>\nMy impression from those systems is that it's not important how you get the clues, but what you DO with them.

Does cleverness matter?  Or is cleverness irrelevant, and solving is entirely up to some combo of the GM, the dice, and whether I happen to look in the right place?<br/><br/>FAIL: If the module does not support clever problem-solving, but I don't know that, and I spend hours trying to fit puzzle pieces which are not actually puzzle pieces but mere color...  That SUCKS.<br/><br/><b>1a)</b> If there's no solving, does the module include lots of cool atmosphere and supernatural shit to drive our characters toward insanity?<br/><br/>FAIL: If there's no solving and no CoC madness fun, this is a shitty module.  No further analysis required.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> If the module is a test of wits, is it a good test?<br/><br/><b>2a)</b> Is the relevance of my choices clear?  Do I know which choices to just pick quickly so we can move on, and which choices to apply my full cleverness to because one option is way better than the other?<br/><br/>FAIL: If I don't know which choices are important, I may spend too much play time on ones that aren't.  One player may want to go faster, another player may want to go slower, and argument may ensue.  Whatever effort we spend on the choice may subsequently be revealed as wasted, putting a big damper on our enthusiasm for the next choice.<br/><br/><b>2b)</b> Are my choices reasonably informed, with at least some sense of risk/reward?<br/><br/>FAIL: If I'm choosing at random, that's not actually a cleverness test.  Which is fine for some choices, but not for the keys to solving the module.  If the key to the module is "you see two doors; left or right?" then that can effectively ruin the premise that I am solving this module (unless I just succeeded at some solving task for which the known reward was "50% chance of victory" and the known failure condition was something less than that).<br/><br/><b>3)</b> Do I know how I'm doing?  How have my choices impacted where I'm at now?  Did I lose, and we can skip to the epilogue now?  Did killing the monster count as total victory, and we can skip to the epilogue now?<br/><br/>FAIL: If I don't get the key puzzle piece, and now there's no reason to expect I ever will, does the GM notice and end it, or do we just keep playing pointlessly?  (You'd think <i>every</i> module would tell the GM when this is, but no such luck.)<br/><br/>Jason, I agree with you that "the investigators didn't get it done; you see in the paper that more people died; oh, the horror!" is fine.  But virtually all of the chokepoint/roadblock misery I've seen could have been avoided by invoking that outcome when it was truly decided, e.g. <i>10 minutes into the game</i>.  If the secret to beating the monster is in the diary in the toybox in the cellar down the stairs under the ancient rug, and the players fail to deduce that the rug is important (whether that's because they weren't clever enough or because the module failed 2a and they ignored it), then the problem-solving endeavor is already over.<br/><br/>To sum up, my approach would be to read through a module, imagining playing through it, and whenever one of the above FAIL conditions comes up, I'd deem it a bad module.  If there's enough other cool stuff in it, then I'd see if I can fix the FAIL myself; if so, then I guess I'd run it, and maybe call it "a good module <i>if you do x</i>."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397609/#Comment_397609" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T12:51:15+00:00" title="November 15, 2012 12:51PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2012 12:53PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in the case of Haunted House my problems are strictly methodological: in hindsight there are obviously ways to deal with these things, they're just ways that are never described in the rules, and thus ways that I've never learned in my occasional CoC-play. The next time I run the adventure I'm totally going to explain in advance that you the players are responsible for efficient use of our time, and if at the end of the night you're stuck and not getting anywhere, we'll just be saying that your investigators forfeit their supposed reward for the case and go home. That's totally a valid way to set up a roleplaying game, I just had no clue at all that I should be utilizing these types of borderline conditions in running the scenario.<br/><br/>As for the railroad-type scenarios, I personally think that individual scenes and how they're presented are a bit of a red herring in comparison to the general attitude of the game. The question that matters to me is whether a game and an adventure provide me with dynamic gameplay where players interact with each other and the GM, influencing where the game goes. If they don't, that's what I call "railroading". In this way all the verbiage in "Puppet Shows and Shadowplays" that is wasted on static scenery is totally indicative of railroading. The car hidden in the desert, for instance, is presented as a supposedly interactive scene where players get to roll dice about stuff. The GM knows, though, that in reality that dice roll doesn't matter at all. It's not interactive and it's not dynamic, the writer already determined this content at the drawing table. How much of your playtime content is passive regurgitation of precreated material? That's my measure of railroading.\n<blockquote><br/>"If the investigators never find the crash site, then the adventure is over." is clearly one way, but can anything be done short of that?<br/></blockquote>\nThis is a very good question, and one that's under active investigation by I imagine the vast majority of tabletop rpg designers everywhere.<br/><br/>My first suggestion is absolute honesty and principle in writing about methodology. I'm sure that this comes as no surprise. Following this ideal we may come to conclude that it is not possible at this time to write adventure modules for this specific game under consideration, simply because the type of play the game endorses is not possible to prepare meaningfully in advance with the tools we currently have in our possession.<br/><br/>The above is not as fanatical as it sounds, there are many games for which people simply don't create adventures in advance because doing so would defeat the point. <i>Polaris</i>, for example.<br/><br/>I find this notion a very serious charge against all that traditional rpg design stands for: could it actually be the case that by encouraging a post-dungeon adventure module culture publishers have pushed for substandard, dishonest and dysfunctional game-writing? This conclusion would be inescapable if we concluded both that CoC is intended to be played in a specific way, and that way is impossible to transcribe on paper in the form of anything but linear prose that is inadequate in capturing how the game is played.<br/><br/>However, such absolutism aside (I don't agree with it myself, anyway), do we actually have some concrete means to write adventures for a game like CoC without resorting to trickery? That is, should I view CoC adventures as simply inadequate in design, or is it actually impossible to solve the railroading conundrum to my standards? Have CoC writers been victims of insufficient rpg theory that we now possess to do better, or are just as stranded as the people writing these exercises in track-laying?<br/><br/>My personal belief is that it is possible to prep and run Call of Cthulhu without reducing the game to the type of static experience the Delta Green rulebook paints in its adventures. I haven't done the practical fieldwork myself yet, so I don't presume to go into the details at this point. A lot obviously depends on whether you're looking to challenge the group of investigators, or whether it's merely important to maximize the drama and horror. Either way, interactivity and real stakes should be possible.<br/><br/>It is interesting and indicative, though, that the great majority of every single Delta Green book is dedicated to extremely open-ended writing that I would characterize as adventure scenarios in any other game. (Any other game that didn't <i>also</i> include a bunch of preplotted adventures in the back, that is.) What is the description of Majestic-12 other than an outline of the forces arrayed against the investigators in a MJ-12 campaign? Even more specifically: I'm currently reading the chapter on the Skoptsi heresy in Delta Green Countdown (I'm reading these books in order), and it's even more narrowly defined as something for the investigators to interact with - it even includes proto-Bangs in how it outlines possible interfaces for the investigators to come into contact with the Skoptsi. All this stuff in Delta Green books presents extremely open-ended environments for potential situations to play with, all without having a single predefined scene that the players have to experience. Why can't the default CoC scenario be more like a Delta Green faction write-up instead of a plotted series of scenes?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397612/#Comment_397612" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T13:06:30+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  1:06PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elaborating on <b>2b</b> from my previous post:<br/><br/>Example: let's say there's an important clue is in a false drawer in a wardrobe in the attic.  The clue is a diary that says on its final page, "The house hasn't been the same since we brought in that oak ottoman which we rescued from the great fire."<br/><br/>Can the group tell the GM, "We search the attic for as long as it takes; what do we find?"  I don't know who answers that question -- the core rulebook, the module, or the GM.  My recollection is that that sort of player request is antithetical to the "hunt for stuff" type of module play, so the GM's answer is reasonably "no".  <br/><br/>But then, how far does it go?  Is "we search the wardrobe" good enough?  How about "we search the wardrobe for hidden compartments?"  Or do we need to roleplay through a series of tapping on panels and measuring drawers until the players pick the exact spot where the hidden drawer is?  <br/><br/>I never remember there being a hard rule for this sort of thing.  I recall that the GM often disavowed responsibility for making that call by leaving it to a die roll... but then, there was the GM call about when you got to roll!  Was a good roll on a "search room" or "search wardrobe" sufficient, or was "search for hidden drawers" required?  I remember one GM using broad search rolls as reveals for what narrower search roll to make next -- success on "search room" yields "check wardrobe" -- but I'm pretty sure that technique wasn't in any book.<br/><br/>So, let's return to my choices as a player.  Here, I'm faced with the choice of how closely to look at stuff, and which stuff to look at.  (Absent a system for modeling "search time" as a finite resource, I <i>could</i> narrate really close investigation of <i>everything</i>.  That would pretty much mean this isn't a challenge situation at all.  But let's suppose the game or the module gives the GM some actionable mandate not to let the players just dick around forever.  If that's communicated to me, as a player, then we can proceed.)  In order to choose wisely, and in order to process whatever clues I've gleaned toward that end, I need to know my options.  What level of narrated investigation is the best, and how much better might it be than the next level, and how much more costly might it be?  What are the factors in that equation?  Is it scope of narration vs fictional time, scope of roll vs real-world play time, or something else?  <br/><br/>If I don't have a handle on what I can do and what are the pros and cons of those options, then a decision which looks like a clever challenge to the designer/writer/GM winds up looking like a total unknown crapshoot to the player.  And if I wind up taking a crapshoot for all the marbles, and realizing I've been wasting all my time trying to win through smarts, then we have EPIC FAIL.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397615/#Comment_397615" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T13:16:59+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  1:16PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say nobody railroads out of malice and we should remember the times those adventures were written. The Delta Green Corebook is from the early 90s. Some developments in style and "technology" had not taken place yet.<br/>Still some Call of Cthulhu Scenarios are just Haunted Hayrides, where the player follow a line and scare pop up left and right. Those of course are railroaded and not as much about making decisions but experiencing the situation. Immersion has to stay alive but if the decisions really changed the outcome of the scenario is a different issue. The dynamic I would see more in playing the charactes reaction to the horrible things and getting freaked out by it together.<br/>I think there are two basic types of Call of Cthulhu scenario. A.) The Investigation and B.) The Horror Show. And they want different kinds of writing and need different kinds of notes. A.) is about creating a line of evidence and clues the characters can follow to find out what is going on. B.) Is more about getting scared by some horrific stuff and playing your characters in that situation. I think this is where David Berg's 1.) and 1a.) come from. The Horror Trip brings the scary atmosphere a cthulhu adventure wants to create into the focus and makes pacing and keeping immersion more important than they would be with the investigation.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Cthulhu Dark and Trail of Cthulhu both tell you to always give out the needed clue for the story to progress and maybe update it by rolls.</blockquote>\nMy impression from those systems is that it's not important how you get the clues, but what you DO with them. Even if you have the clues, you can still fail to interpret them, but that's depends on the players' skills and not the characters.<br/><br/>When I read the quoted sentence above, I sensed that you meant that those systems were written to railroad, so I have to disagree. But perhaps I'm just creating a straw man here. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nNot really. I meant they were written to avoid chokepoints in investigative adventures (or that is what I would think.) I was saying that the "If the PCs do not make the roll or look here they will get the clue anyway" style of writing tries to accomplish the same thing in clumsier, maybe more 80ish / 90ish ways. And not for the whole system Call of Cthulhu but that specific situation in that specific adventure. It might seem railroady to some that the players always get the clue in Trail of Cthulhu but not me and I do not think it would be worth arguing it too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397623/#Comment_397623" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T13:50:29+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  1:50PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Jason, I agree with you that "the investigators didn't get it done; you see in the paper that more people died; oh, the horror!" is fine.

If they don't, that's what I call "railroading". In this way all the verbiage in "Puppet Shows and Shadowplays" that is wasted on static scenery is totally indicative of railroading. The car hidden in the desert, for instance, is presented as a supposedly interactive scene where players get to roll dice about stuff. The GM knows, though, that in reality that dice roll doesn't matter at all. It's not interactive and it's not dynamic, the writer already determined this content at the drawing table. How much of your playtime content is passive regurgitation of precreated material? That's my measure of railroading.</blockquote>\nAre all modules railroading in your book then? That seems REALLY overbroad to me.  Even a location-based adventure is "passive regurgitation of precreated material" - every place the characters go inside the Haunted House, there's precreated material the GM will present.<br/><br/>I question the conclusion that "in reality" the die roll to find the car in the middle of the desert "doesn't matter at all".  I think it does, insofar as it is a potential achievement for the player characters.  They may be good enough FBI agents to cleverly spot it or the plodding locals may show them up.<br/><br/>I think I have a fairly competitive view of CoC module play - perhaps that's my own personal conclusion from the "here's what happens if you fail" text at the end.  Like, I'm here to beat this module and show how good I am.  If the dumb local cops find the key clue and I don't, I should and will feel a little bit down about it.\n<blockquote>It is interesting and indicative, though, that the great majority of every single Delta Green book is dedicated to extremely open-ended writing that I would characterize as adventure scenarios in any other game. (Any other game that didn't <i>also</i> include a bunch of preplotted adventures in the back, that is.) What is the description of Majestic-12 other than an outline of the forces arrayed against the investigators in a MJ-12 campaign? Even more specifically: I'm currently reading the chapter on the Skoptsi heresy in Delta Green Countdown (I'm reading these books in order), and it's even more narrowly defined as something for the investigators to interact with - it even includes proto-Bangs in how it outlines possible interfaces for the investigators to come into contact with the Skoptsi. All this stuff in Delta Green books presents extremely open-ended environments for potential situations to play with, all without having a single predefined scene that the players have to experience. Why can't the default CoC scenario be more like a Delta Green faction write-up instead of a plotted series of scenes?</blockquote>\nBut what would that <i>be</i>?  Wouldn't that just be another faction write-up and not a scenario at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397635/#Comment_397635" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T14:25:20+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  2:25PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2012 2:25PM by Johnstone.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, if you are like me, you bought <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> 4th edition when you were 12 and learned how to run it from the ready-to-play scenarios. So I'll go a little farther back than Jason and start there.<br/><br/><b>1. The Haunted House (aka The Haunting in 5th ed):</b><br/>Landlord says "my house is haunted," the investigators check it out. Players have two options here, the first being search the house. Finding both the monster and papers that contain a partial explanation require no rolls. There is a roll required to find an item. Solving the mystery by charging into the house is dangerous and may kill some characters, but is completely do-able. The scenario gives the monster's motivations and some behaviours that are based on PC actions. The PCs are then left to their own devices.<br/><br/>The second option is, of course research. Why would the players think to do research? Because of what it says on page 88, in the "How to Play the Game" section:<br/>"The first step in a <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> scenario is to determine what you are up against. This may involve going to the library, speaking with local residents, trying to obtain journals and diaries of those involved, and comparing reports of the problem with the character's arcane books."<br/>If the PCs do this, no roll is required to find out exactly where and who the monster is. Some rolls are required to obtain additional clues, many of which seem to act as plot hooks for continuing the adventure.<br/><br/>If the players do not investigate, then they do not know how to play the game. If they had followed the instructions in the first column of the first page of the "How to Play the Game" section, they would have known where the monster was, without having to roll.<br/><br/><b>2.The Madman (also in 5e):</b><br/>Some hick has gone insane, the investigators check it out. How there could be a choke point in this scenario is beyond me, it is way too short. Players must roll to get info from anybody except the hick himself who will just tell them he is consorting with aliens. The aliens come at night and either the investigators stop them or they destroy the whole valley, the end.<br/><br/>The 5e version adds the missing nespaperman, more clues, and some motivations for investigators to be investigating.<br/><br/><b>3. The Brockford House</b><br/>Dude says his house is fucked up, the investigators check it out. Rolls are required to find clues unless the players dig in the one obvious place, in which case they find the secret stuff automatically. Finding the secret stuff turns this adventure into a dungeon crawl, essentially, only with no treasure, just traps and monsters.<br/><br/>Sadly, and unlike "The Haunted House," there is no research section to this adventure, which makes it rather sub-par comparatively.<br/><br/><b>A note follows these three scenarios:</b><br/>"The following adventures are by various authors, and are less to be regarded as models than to be simply enjoyed."<br/>Which suggests these three are models for properly playing <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>. Summarizing them in brief:<br/>1. Somebody asks you to investigate.<br/>2. You find some clues, maybe, and probably somebody tells you where the monster is. Or it's just obvious.<br/>3. You find the monster.<br/>4a. You go insane.<br/>4b. You are killed.<br/>4c. You go home and the monster kills people.<br/>4d. You defeat the monster and go home.<br/><br/>Interestingly, all four of the next adventures are actually better than "The Brockford House," in my opinion.<br/><br/><b>4. Paper Chase</b><br/>Dude had some books stolen, wants them back, the investigators check it out. There are exactly 6 clues, each of which requires a roll, each of which should reasonably point out the monster's location, all on its own. The PCs must then interact with the monster. In order to reach a choke point in this adventure, the players must fail all their roll, not just one. This is a perfect example of how to design a mystery by creating a secret thing and scattering clues as to its location all over the place, so that if the players obtain even a third of them, they should have a pretty solid solution.<br/><br/><b>5.The Underground Menace</b><br/>Unlike other 4e scenarios, this one gives several options for how PCs get involved (this innovation was also added to 5e scenarios). There are earthquakes in Michigan, the investigators check it out. Most of the investigation here pertains to the bad guy, and the clue (just one) that lead the investigators to him is a rather poor hook. It requires a roll, but this roll can be made over and over again until it succeeds. Once the bad guy is identified, however, the investigation leads pretty clearly to a monster. This scenario gives clear instructions on a variety of success and failure results, and combinations.<br/><br/><b>6. The Rescue</b><br/>Dude dies in the woods, the investigators check it out. This adventure has a lot of NPCs and colour details to it. There are only two groups of people in this adventure causing trouble: the bad guys and the guys who will tell the investigators about the bad guys, so it is quite easy to identify the bad guys. Once they start investigating the bad guys, a fight is almost inevitable, and that's the end of the adventure.<br/><br/><b>7. Mystery of Loch Feinn</b><br/>Dude is murdered in Scotland, the investigators check it out. A successful Spot Hidden roll will get the investigators all the inside dope. If they fail that roll, they can just ask any local who the bad guys are, without needing to roll. Once they know who the bad guys are, a few rolls for research uncover some more clues. Or they could just go to the bad guys' house and either fight them or secretly watch them summon monsters.<br/><br/>So there you go. That's seven typical <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> scenarios, and specifically the seven that would have taught you how to run the game and write your own adventures if you started between 1989 and 1992. If this rulebook turned you into a railroading Keeper or left you frustrated with choke points, I don't know what to tell you, other than you fucked up. None of these adventures, except for "The Brockford House," try to hide the monster or the cultists, and honstly some of these would make great towns for <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397641/#Comment_397641" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T14:57:39+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  2:57PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Again, I don't think that the adventure I cite here is particularly exceptional in this regard, this sort of stuff has been all over the CoC stuff I read.

This rulebook has only 4 adventures, two of which are revised versions of 4e adventures. They have more clues and more possible ways for the investigators to get involved. There are two new ones.<br/><br/><b>1. The Edge of Darkness</b><br/>Dying man give the investigators the keys to a house, they check it out. Most of the information is provided automatically to the PCs. A host of other clues require rolls or looking in specific places, but are not necessary. Finding the monster is quite easy, defeating it requires a macguffin that is mentioned in the original handouts but must be found. This requires investigation but no roll. There are also suggestions for ways the Keeper can introduce more clues, if the ones provided are not enough.<br/><br/><b>2. Dead-Man Stomp</b><br/>The investigators see a man get killed and come back to life, so they check it out. This adventure is a series of events that occur afterwards and the various clues that PCs can find that will lead them to be present at those events. Clues that lead them directly there can be found without requiring a roll, as long as the PCs look around. If the PCs do not solve the mystery and stop the various NPCs from acting, things get worse and worse, as detailed in the adventure.<br/><br/>If there's a choke point in this one, it's that it starts at a specific club, so the PCs have to be there. If they miss clues, they'll probably hear about the rather public consequences of inaction, but some of the clues are pretty obvious.<br/><br/>Those are two more typical <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> adventures. Combined with the other two (already mentioned), they might be somewhat intimidating for a new Keeper, because they are pretty heavily laden down with clues and player handouts and whatnot. But Keepers are encouraged to introduce enough clues that the PCs can get to the end of the adventure fairly easily, there don't seem to be any choke points, and there's no railroading except maybe for how PCs are introduced into a scenario.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397660/#Comment_397660" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T19:59:25+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  7:59PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree that Dead-Man Stomp doesn't have any railroading elements (though you are right, starting at a speakeasy is pretty awesome and anyone who says 'no' to that should be shown the egress):<br/><br/>The characters <i>can</i> miss a couple of events and learn about them later, though some of the realizations become impossible - if they don't fully investigate the trumpet player's background (or succeed in the rolls listed), they won't learn of his eventual destination for his last horrific concert.  Furthermore a box indicates that the investigators "must witness" a kidnaping (sic), and following that, there's a scene where "the intent of the scene is to confront Turner with the power of his horn, to drive him mad, and escape". Given that the characters will, if they don't intervene, witness at least one mob slaying, it seems likely (and in all my play of this scenario, everyone has) intervened, and put securing the trumpet and/or the player as top priority.<br/><br/>It has a lot of good things about it - the (very basic) treatment of race in the 1920s is not terrible, and is actually pretty unique. But it does have some troublesome stuff mixed into it - some of them in places where players are likely to stumble over them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397661/#Comment_397661" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T20:10:20+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  8:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My understanding of railroading is pretty much the same as Eero's and Rickard's. That car in the desert thing drives me crazy. Any time the character's have a chance to do something, don't do it, and then end up doing that thing anyway (i.e. finding the car) it's complete bullshit, IMO (though I realize a lot of people play that way). For situations like that, I tend to think it's better to frame straight to the players encountering the car, if that's something that has to happen for the game to work. As GM, you just look at the players and say, "So, our story begins when you stumbled upon the abandoned car in the desert, after hours of staring at sand dunes until your eyes almost glazed over." That's much better than pretending there's a real choice there (find the car or not) when there really isn't.<br/><br/>In my mind, part of "play to find out what happens" (to quote recent jargon) is that the choices and success/failure in the game is CONSEQUENTIAL. If the players don't find the car initially, maybe the problem gets worse or you fast-forward to several months later where some other fucked up stuff is happening, leading them to other clues that maybe eventually lead back to the car in the desert. Or maybe the car in the desert is found by other people, leading to other situations. It's really not that hard to turn a railroad into a sandbox! You just look at the situation (a lot like a town in Dogs in the Vineyard) and ask: What happens if the heroes never find this place or unravel this mystery? How do things get worse? And then you make THAT the game.<br/><br/>Alternately, it's totally possible to have games where you don't play to find out what happens. You can also play to find out what events MEAN. Or play to find out the DETAILS or CONTEXT that surrounds a fixed set of events. Games like My Daughter Queen of France come to mind, among others. But the issue I have with railroaded scenarios/modules (and the reason the Forge liked to label them "illusionism") is that they pretend that the players have meaningful, consequential choices that help determine the outcome of major events, not just providing color and context to fixed events. But, in practice, that's not what adventure writing tends to suggest. I was just reading this Dark Sun module and I wanted to scream, jump up and down, and rip pages out due to all of the manipulative GM bullshit it suggests to do, fooling the players into thinking that their choices and rolled results actually matter. I guess I just prefer honesty and transparency rather than obfuscation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397662/#Comment_397662" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T21:04:36+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  9:04PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2012 9:11PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the idea that every single roll must be consequential-in-all-caps isn't really backed up by the CoC system. Play is more of an aggregate of rolls, each of which have minor consequences (like me being grumbly that the dumb local cops found the car instead of me) but which in toto form a series of consequential actions and events.<br/><br/>Actually consequential-in-all-caps rolls in these modules are often <i>worse</i> design, since, as noted, sometimes if you fail the wrong roll, you say "welp, looks like you lost the module, thanks for coming over."<br/><br/>So let me ask this:\n<blockquote>You just look at the situation (a lot like a town in Dogs in the Vineyard) and ask: What happens if the heroes never find this place or unravel this mystery? How do things get worse? And then you make THAT the game.</blockquote>\nHow do you think this should be done in a module, or do you think all modules are inherently fallen in this way?<br/><br/>Also, why are you okay with starting at the car, but having a paragraph that says "the PCs might find the car if they make these rolls, or NPCs might find the car if they don't, but in either event they end up at the car"?  Like, the outcome is literally the same. The PCs are at the car with a minimum of fuss. Maybe they get a charge out of finding it by their own actions or they get a bit down because they're plodding along behind the locals, but couldn't you just narrate that as part of your scene-setting idea and get the same result? Like, would you be okay with a scene-setting GM that said "You have completely failed to find the location of interest, but the local cops, smirking, let you know they located it for you.

It's awesome if it sets something up (there's the insider/outsider tension, or maybe it shows I'm good at some things or lousy at others, as long as it expresses something that pushes things forward) and it's lame if it just gives the GM an opportunity to grandstand without engaging any of the other players or if it robs me of the agency to make other interesting choices (it feels less like robbery if there was never a choice offered to me in the first place).<br/><br/>I definitely get rolls being consequential in little, incremental ways rather than major ones. That's... something a bit new that my brain is trying to decide what it thinks about it. Theoretically it makes sense, but I wonder if it would make me impatient in practice, without seriously retraining my expectations. My impulse is to say, if you're just making little incremental random changes to the fiction, why use dice at all? Why not just have those come out of freeform interactions between the players?

I'd argue that Masks of Nyarlathotep is at least part sandbox, as there's several different countries the Investigators can travel to, in just about any order. Oscar Rios described his Cthulhu Invictus scenario "Blood and Glory" as a sandbox. As I understand it, a sandbox may or may not have a timetable, but there's no "The Investigators must first do A, then B, then C..."<br/><br/>The challenge, then, is to make sure that the players aren't getting frustrated hunting for clues where there are none, or otherwise wandering about the sandbox getting more and more frustrated as less and less happens. I've identified one point in Masks of Nyarlathotep where I think that's a real danger.<br/><br/>Basically, you need to navigate the line between too railroady (nothing the players do can change anything, so just write the novel and stop trying to inflict it on people in the form of a game) and too sandboxy (the players have to read your mind to know which corner of the sandbox to dig up).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397671/#Comment_397671" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T22:34:37+00:00" title="November 15, 2012 10:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2012 10:36PM by Johnstone.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I have a sneaking suspicion that CoC players who've had good results with the game tend to use dice a whole lot less than players who've had bad results with CoC, much as you suggest with your second paragraph (and as Johnstone seems to suggest in his discussions of the presented adventures in the core rulesets).</blockquote>\nI think the majority of these 9 adventures are implicitly doing what the Gumshoe system calls out and makes explicit. Clues that lead the PCs towards the bad guys/monster/confrontation are free if you just look for them, but clues that add details and backstory or point out the monster's major weaknesses require rolls or are hard(er) to find. And then on top of that basic assumption, some bonus clues are free, some clues are actually violence, and if there are enough clues that point directly at the climactic confrontation, you can ask for rolls for each one, because the odds of flubbing them all is very small.<br/><br/>I seem to remember we still rolled for lots of stuff, but we didn't roll for <i>everything</i>, right? If I ran an adventure and there was a clue but no roll mentioned, the players never rolled for it. Maybe other Keepers asked for rolls in some of these instances, and that lead to bad experiences?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397672/#Comment_397672" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T22:34:49+00:00" title="November 15, 2012 10:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> My impulse is to say, if you're just making little incremental random changes to the fiction, why use dice at all?

It doesn't tell you anything about what <i>happens</i>, but adds a randomized creative constraint to your play, as you do <i>other</i> things to decide what happens.  Secretly, I think a lot of trad game task resolution is exactly that.  It adds value by giving you some input to riff off of.  The only problem comes up (a) when you roll for something that shouldn't be left to chance, or (b) when the results of a roll aren't honored.<br/><br/>JayWalt, sound good?<br/><br/>I think your point about agency-<i>robbery</i> is the key.  If the players make a choice (or die roll) that isn't <i>expected</i> to be consequential, and is just a way to see what <i>route</i> the situation takes to wherever it's going, then nothing is lost.  You had agency over a small thing -- color and fictional specifics -- and you used it.  On the other hand, if you think that "go to the car or not" is an <i>important</i> choice, and you <i>invest</i> in your choice to not go to the car, expecting there to be significant <i>consequences</i> for this choice, so you can see if it <i>worked out for the best</i> or <i>not</i>... then being forced to go to the car anyway is <i>total</i> robbery of the agency you thought you had.<br/><br/>I don't recall anything in CoC helping the group identify and separate "color" choices/rolls from "big consequences" choices/rolls.

One is the old school D&amp;D location-based commando operation, also known as the dungeon: a D&amp;D dungeon will lay out the land, set up treasure and monsters, and then leave the players to determine their own approach. Because the players control pacing, approach vector and their own advance knowledge of what is ahead, they have a massive amount of say on what actually happens in play, all despite <i>also</i> having a very detailed way to prepare a game, so much so that the D&amp;D GM can actually be a "referee" much of the time, just adjudicating interaction instead of inventing stuff.<br/><br/>The other system is the Forge-originating relationship map model that was established in Sorcerer's Soul and utilized in games like Trollbabe, Dogs in the Vineyard and many others. Heroquest is an interesting game in that several adventure modules have been written for it under this paradigm, but it has also gotten a big share of traditional linear prose adventures. The relationship adventure, as most of us know, looks a bit like a traditional adventure in that it introduces NPCs and perhaps provides a ready-made starting position for the player characters. The difference is in the fact that the relationship map adventure doesn't provide a string of scenes, it just communicates the likely motivations of the NPCs in clear and easily applicable ways. In play the GM then provides content by looking at this orchestra of NPCs and associated locations, and allows the actions of the characters (PC and NPC alike) to drive play. Typically a list of Bangs is involved: the scenario-author provides suggestions like hey, maybe this character I told you about could break into the PC's house sometime, assuming the PC catches their eye.<br/><br/>Those two and the traditional linear prose adventure are basically the three types of module structures that I know about, I can't offhand name a fourth one. This is a strange situation, as one would assume that such a central type of rpg text would have more technical variety to it. It goes without saying that this is a very fruitful field for further rpg development - figuring out how to deliver premade content in new and exciting ways that leave different space for the players to fill at the table.<br/><br/>(The CoC investigation adventure, while often not written in a strikingly different manner, is still a somewhat different beast compared to the linear adventure. It's sort of a halfway house between the D&amp;D location-based challenge and the linear adventure in that the amount of clues and the responsiveness of the antagonist NPCs seems to ultimately determine whether play becomes a string of static scenes or a dynamic battlefield like in D&amp;D. Even the most dynamic adventures in CoC are still written with verbiage that smacks of linear thinking: "after the investigators do this" and so on, things that are never said in interaction-aware game texts.)<br/><br/>What is notable about the very structure of the linear adventure is that everything that myself and some others find annoying and dull about them directly derives from how these adventures are written. Once you have this image of what an adventure text is like, and that image involves a long string of scenes that build upon each other, what other choice do you have except to end up with a text that presumes outcomes? It's an integral outcome of how these texts are written, and the author's propensity towards railroading is to a degree secondary.<br/><br/>If one wanted to write CoC adventures in a less sequential and linear manner, it'd require reimagining the structure of the entire adventure text. For example, "Puppet Shows and Shadow Plays" is an adventure that basically pits the investigators against a single alien being that crashlands in the USA and then proceeds to take control of people (it lives within their torso) for the purposes of serial killing. As the adventure begins the alien is in Arizona indian lands. As far as I can see, all the kewl parts of this adventure could have just as easily been delivered in a non-sequential manner if the author had the balls to let go of his setpiece details. The adventure is full of these small iconic scenes the author has preimagined for the GM, but setting them up requires a massively heavy hand: the alien has to kill at specific times in specific places, it has to escape to kill again, or all these lovely preworked setpiece encounters won't get to happen. The basic idea of the adventure has nothing in it that requires a linear treatment, it could just as easily be a detailed map of a 200 mile stretch of Arizona and a few instructions and ideas of what kinds of events might happen depending on what players do; the only thing this would require would be letting go of the idea that the module author is writing a horror story, and embracing the idea that the GM can do the little narrative detail in play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397683/#Comment_397683" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T01:43:57+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  1:43AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the point of this analysis?

Still they give more than a starting point but a bit of a goal too. Might be a mixture between the linear prose and the relationship map. That also takes a timeline into account.<br/>\n<blockquote>...the only thing this would require would be letting go of the idea that the module author is writing a horror story, and embracing the idea that the GM can do the little narrative detail in play.<br/></blockquote>\nBut can the GM do that? For an introductionary adventure I can see the use of at least giving him a possible way it all can unfold and write it down. Maybe even a railroad to follow is not the worst. So he gets an idea how to pace an adventure and what stories in general work for the system. Of course it should be pointed out that this is not the only thing that works in this system and best provide another adventure that is not railroaded at all. Still barring extensive examples of "actual play" in the book, the adventures in the back are how the fresh GM sees how the game is supposed to be run and played. A little bit of hand holding might be appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397692/#Comment_397692" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T02:22:05+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  2:22AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Collaborate storytelling, like in Archipelago, Lady Blackbird, Polaris, Bad Family, Fiasco, Montsegur 1244 and even InSpectres.</blockquote>\nHalf of those don't have prewritten adventures (Polaris and InSpectres, for example) to any appreciable degree and some like Lady Blackbird rely on entirely ordinary relationship map techniques (that is, the module consists of characters with motivations and perhaps some Bangs).<br/><br/>However, you do have a bit of a point about Fiasco, Zombie Cinema, The Mountain Witch and similar games: they do sort of have an adventure module separate from the process of play, but that module doesn't follow any of the three structures I mentioned above. It's more like their adventure modules consist of a bunch of color elements and setting tropes. There are no predefined dramatic actors, no adventure location nor a preplanned plot, just a bunch of genre conceits and colorful concepts. The process of play then shapes a relationship map and other scenario elements out of this primordial soup.<br/><br/>Of course that's a relatively sparse structure for an adventure module. I'm not complaining, but the challenge Call of Cthulhu sort of posits us is not just how we can strip an adventure module from everything that interferes with player participation, but also how we might retain the literary values and background work that goes into those adventures. I mean, I suppose that most people will agree with me that the real value in a CoC adventure module comes in the historical detail, pre-named NPCs, detailed locations and all that literary stuff the GM can barf forth to provide color and nuance for play. Is it possible to retain this level of fictional detail, but structure the adventure to respect player input into what happens?<br/><br/>I'm relatively certain that "Haunted House" is not ultimately a flawed adventure, the tools the game gives me are just inadequate when combined with my native skills. I see no theoretical reason why an adventure that consists of a haunted location and a detailed backstory shouldn't be gameable in an interactive way. I just need to figure out a game system that enables players to conduct investigations in an entertaining manner (yes, Gumshoe is an option) so these sorts of adventures can be utilized with proper pacing, unwinding the horrible secrets hiding behind the facade of the ordinary. In this regard I'm totally on board with the interpretation that CoC's problems stem from its system and method writing, and not so much from the adventure design.<br/><br/>On the other hand, "Puppet Shows and Shadow Plays" and other linear plot adventures, I'm not so sure that I'll ever be comfortable with those. Perhaps if we agreed in advance that the game's going to be a plot railroad, then the GM could just do clean scene framing and take the characters from event to event without all the murk in between as players try to guess where the next cutscene is. I've done some experimenting with this sort of thing, but perhaps we're just too recalcicant as players to truly embrace the railway; players get insufferably cynical and ironic, myself included, when we play a participationist game where the players know that their role is mostly to enjoy listening to the GM's story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397695/#Comment_397695" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T03:31:26+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  3:31AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2012 7:55AM by Rickard.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I think the problem isn't how to solve the situation, but the situation itself.

Hopefully that will clear things up a bit.<br/><br/>First, how "sandboxy" are you guys thinking?<br/><br/>I don't recall ever viewing CoC play in the same way I might view D&amp;D play where PCs wander across a landscape taking adventures or not as they choose. Scratch that. I've never viewed it that way. So right there, one sort of sandbox play is off the table from my POV.<br/><br/>Second, I play CoC either as completely self contained one shots ( and some thoughts elsewhere or later on that approach), or as a  not-particularly-connected series of adventures with recurring characters, with as much inspiration drawn from non-Lovecraftian monster-hunting/monster of the week style sources as from anything that HPL ever wrote.<br/><br/>Is that how you folks are approaching this, or are you coming from a different angle?<br/><br/>Third, I'm coming at this stuff from an angle of a kind of unspoken concept that the PCs will be investigators who investigate a mystery, that they will follow up on the mystery, and that mystery will have some sort of conclusion, and indeed, along the way, there will be some sort of events involved that pack action or threats into that experience and the Keeper is in charge of making sure that stuff happens.<br/><br/>Now the outcomes can be all kinds of variations of win, lose, abandon, partial pyrhic victory or whatever. But everyone starts out on board with the idea that this is the core of the game experience and agrees to that.<br/><br/>Is that how you folks are approaching these things or in some different fashion?<br/><br/>Now my questions are, gievn these assumptions, what are and where are chokepoints, and what constitutes ralroading anyway in that sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397711/#Comment_397711" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T07:08:27+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  7:08AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"If the investigators never find the crash site, then the adventure is over." is clearly one way, but can anything be done short of that?</blockquote>\nYou just change the start of the adventure from "do you find the crash site" to "hey, this crash site got found, what do you do?".<br/><br/>I'd actually love to see a rewrite of "Puppet Shows and Shadow Plays" that serves as a before/after example of how to rewrite adventures to foster more player agency.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397712/#Comment_397712" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T07:21:48+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  7:21AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2012 7:24AM by komradebob.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a side note, some of CoC play isn't just about working together and winning the tough scenario, it's also about showing off what your character can do ( a bit like your character build), and frankly, sometimes showing up your fellow investigators when your character's particular talents help win the day. Or alternately, laughing out of character as someone fails miserably, perhaps being destroyed in the process when they thought the whole thing was in the bag.<br/><br/>Usually, CoC investigators have a spread of skills that fall into three categories: physical stuff, brainy stuff, and social stuff ( with some weird things that fit into a border space between those categories). Part of the fun and the challenge is designing and playing a character that covers those bases but also has some overlap with other characters as backup when the seemingly obvious expert in a category blows their roll.<br/><br/>In that mindset, a chokepoint comes up when there really is only one way to grab a clue, the clue is key, and nobody can makke an appropriate successful roll or no future opportunities for that key roll are available. Which really should pretty much be never, since the GM always has the option of giving Idea rolls as a final answer giver if all else fails ( or at least a clue to a clue).<br/><br/>Again, is this something other people are doing, or is this just the way I've been playing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397714/#Comment_397714" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T07:43:41+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  7:43AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You just change the start of the adventure from "do you find the crash site" to "hey, this crash site got found, what do you do?".</blockquote>\nSo you would just remove all chance that the PCs might be the ones that find it?

Like, I don't think I would have any objection to somebody saying: "Hey, so you're going to end up at the car no matter what. But let's roll to see whether you impress or show up the local police by finding it first, or whether they find it before you do." That seems totally reasonable! What doesn't seem reasonable or honest to me is pretending that the roll is about whether you find the car or not, which isn't really up for grabs, yeah? Like I said, I'm totally open to rolls being consequential in ways other than success/failure and love a lot of games in which that is the case.<br/><br/>Would being explicit about such things (and destroying the "illusionism") also destroy the sense of mystery and the unknown in this style of play? I can imagine situations further down the road where it might. Like: "Okay, so no matter what you do, your investigator is going to end up being eaten by the fish people. You're deep in their grotto and they've got you surrounded. The only thing at stake here is whether you can spend your death wisely to ensure that someone else is able to escape." That preserves player agency but at the cost of removing some of the tension, confusion, and uncertainty that contributes to tone, unless you pitch it very carefully ("You stare into all their sightless, unblinking eyes and realize the harsh truth that you will never escape this place. But surely someone must return to the surface and warn the others, lest this horror continue unabated.

This seems an odd way to increase player agency.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nNaw. It puts player agency where it belongs. The question isn't "do you find the clue?" but "what do you do with it?"<br/><br/>If you want player input on <i>how</i> they get the clue that they are going to get, then make it transparent. Either just ask them a leading question about how they get there (as some of the more contemporary games encourage a GM to do), or tell them up front that their roll is going to be about whether their character gets to be awesome or gets shown up by the locals.<br/><br/>If you present the roll as "make this roll or you won't get to see the clue" and then give them the clue a different way when they fail, you are being dishonest as a GM about what the roll means. And the text is telling you to be dishonest in that way. Which is bad. So it needs fixed.<br/><br/>Another option is to play up the dysfunctional interrelationships between the PCs as an important element of play. Once you do that, you can make the roll be about who finds the clue and whether or not they share that information fully with the rest of the players. There's some room for interesting play there, which is usually not explored in CoC games, and which the system doesn't seem to explicitly support. I'd love to see some Smallville and Monsterhearts influences used in a CoC hack that would play to that aspect. I think it would potentially play to the "the other humans are the real monsters" aspect that I love about a good zombie movie. Or the rich inter-character drama stuff that you see in a good hour long TV series.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397744/#Comment_397744" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T11:26:55+00:00" title="November 16, 2012 11:26AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What's the point of this analysis?

Others have mentioned that "typical" CoC adventures have chokepoints and other flaws and that this sentiment is relatively common. My experience with playing a crapload of typical CoC adventures is that this is not the case. I found typical CoC adventures to constitute a healthy and functional style of play that works reliably.<br/><br/>But, obviously other people didn't get it the way I did. Which is not really a surprise, since even I don't think the text really explains how play works, flows, and functions, or why certain decisions are made when designing an adventure. I certainly learned the game by running the adventures, not by reading any explanation. So if I can learn how to better communicate that style of play, that helps me out quite a bit.<br/><br/>So, related to that, Eero, do you want to discuss The Haunted House in more detail, and we can

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>So, related to that, Eero, do you want to discuss The Haunted House in more detail, and we can look at exactly what didn't work and why?</blockquote>\nSure, if that's of interest. If you'll review the adventure for us here in general, I'll join in with my own experiences later. I'm a bit busy this weekend, but we're not exactly under a deadline in this discussion.<br/><br/>Not that my experiences from the last time I ran Haunted House are particularly special, it's just the usual murk you get when people are trying to play a vague and unfamiliar game without the skills needed. Our primary flow issue in the session in question was quite literally the fact that the players (me as Keeper included) took forever roleplaying social interactions with completely ancillary NPCs. There aren't even any important NPCs in the adventure, but somehow we managed to spend something like four hours without the players ever getting to the literary sources or the church of starry wisdom (was that the name?). The only bit of actual content we got to was the haunting in the upstairs rooms with the poltergeist bed and blood on the walls and whatnot. The players actually resorted to sleeping in the house before they even checked the entire house out; this is indicative of just how incompetent we are as a CoC troupe, the investigators were entirely clueless about how to solve an adventure that requires nothing but actually entering every room in the house.<br/><br/>(And yes, these are the same people with whom I've been playing D&amp;D for the last year and a half. I probably should run them through the Haunting a second time just to see whether they've learned anything about group cohesion, productive leadership, logistics and logical thinking since then.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397783/#Comment_397783" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T17:49:29+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  5:49PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, here's a more in-depth description of The Haunted House than the one I posted before (SPOYLARZ, peoples!!!):<br/><br/>The investigators are asked to go look at a haunted house. They have two avenues of approach, basically: they can go look at the house, or they can go research it (it's an old East Coast house).<br/><br/>If they check out the house, it is fairly small. There are three floors.<br/>-- On the ground floor, in a boarded-up cupboard there is the bad guy's diary and a magical book, proof positive of some sort of Mythos activity. This clue is found by searching, no roll required, and gives the bad guy's name.<br/>-- There is nothing in the upper floor except poltergeist activity, which may attack and harm (or just mislead) investigators.<br/>-- In the basement, poltergeist activity may cause investigators to fall down the stairs. A Spot Hidden roll reveals a magical knife, but it can also attack the investigators. The basement has three walls made of brick and one made of wooden boards. Breaking through the wooden boards reveals the bad guy.<br/><br/>If they do research,<br/>-- The library reveals who the bad guy is and that he is buried in the basement (also, my mistake, this does require a research roll).<br/>-- Newspaper archives (roll to get in, but not to research) reveal a history of residents dying.<br/>-- Civic records of the bad guy's will (no roll) connect him to a mystical church, which was closed down by police.<br/>-- Police records (again, roll to get in but not to research) say the church was raided and some people were arrested, but the reverend escaped, so no NPCs to follow up on (for now).<br/>-- In the church building (which is closed down), records say the bad guy was buried in the basement.<br/><br/>The adventure does say that the bad guy will try to trick the investigators into thinking that the haunting is all up on the top floor, and the newspaper lead is just colour.<br/>But a) looking in the basement, b) making a Library Use roll, or c) following the church lead, which requires the bad guy's name and consists of civic records and then possibly the police and finally the church building itself, should lead the investigators to a final showdown with the bad guy.<br/><br/><br/>And it sounds like your players failed on all three accounts, yeah? They didn't go into the basement and they spent most of their time interacting with NPCs who aren't connected to the mystery. So now I'm curious about two things:<br/><br/>1. What were their expectations and understanding of the play style? Did they know this was a game where PCs are expected to spend time poring through paperwork?<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>2. Where did they get their expectations and/or understanding of the game from? Were they completely new to CoC? Or investigation rpgs in general? Did they read the rules, did you explain the rules to them, and if so, what parts? etc. And what kind of previous rpg play were they used to, if any?<br/><br/>Take your time. Like you said, there's no deadline.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397878/#Comment_397878" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T16:34:24+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  4:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so here's our summary so far. Gonna try to divvy it up into Railroading, Chokepoints and Magician's-Choice ratings, though as I say, Magician's-Choice versus Just Good Design is a little fuzzy for me right now.  I'm able to get some things from Johnstone's and Eero's analysis...Lisa, if you want to come back and be more specific, I'll include yours too:<br/><br/>Edge of Darkness: No Railroading, Chokepoints or Magician's Choice (I'll call this "nothing" from now on).<br/>The Haunting: Nothing.<br/>The Madman: Magician's Choice.<br/>The Brockford House: Nothing.<br/>Paper Chase: Nothing.<br/>The Underground Menace: Nothing.<br/>The Rescue: Nothing.<br/>Mystery of Loch Feinn: Magician's Choice.<br/>Dead-Man Stomp: Railroading, Magician's Choice.<br/><br/>Gonna put Delta Green in its own section:<br/><br/>Puppet Shows &amp; Shadow Plays: Railroading, Magician's Choice.<br/><br/>Eventually I'll summarize our findings completely.<br/><br/>Okay, on to some more!<br/><br/>From Cthulhu by Gaslight 2ed (1988):<br/><br/>The Yorkshire Horrors: A big, sprawling adventure where Sherrinford Holmes (Sherlock's OTHER brother) is FRAEMED FOR MURDAR by the Napoleon of Crime, who is also leading a Cthuloid cult. LOLOL. This is a great adventure. However, there is a ton of railroading stuff if the characters start to suspect the hired men too quickly. There's a lot of knockout drugs in food and drink, tied up investigators, etc.  I'm calling it Railroading even though there's no set series of events the investigators must experience, and indeed, an interesting timeline of Events that proceed if the investigators don't interfere with them.<br/><br/>The Realm of Shadows (1997)<br/><br/>This is a huge campaign book, having to do with a prolonged conflict with ghouls and their charnel god in 1940. I've looked pretty carefully through this and actually the design of this one is very advanced. There are some "exit points" - the investigators go from dealing with a single ghoul, to a ghoul community, to the source of the ghouls' cult, and while there's solid direction from one part of the scenario to the next, there's clear places where the investigators can go and do other things as well. There's even some related "side material" in the form of Dreamlands stuff and dealing with a mad scientist. For the size of this material and for there to be virtually none of the stuff we're talking about is quite an achievement.<br/><br/>The Unspeakable Oath <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2314-15&amp;Mode=like">#14-15</a> (1997)<br/><br/>Fuel of the Gods (potentially Delta Green): An experimental fuel based on "oil" pumped from a mysterious place beneath the ocean affects three drivers in increasingly horrifying ways, the investigators are asked to handle each of them.  Not seeing any issues here.<br/><br/>Call of Duty: Treasury agent PCs are dispatched to deal with a cultist bootlegger and the crooked town that's protecting him. This is a pretty high-octane action scenario with shitloads of tommy guns and dynamite. It's completely location based.<br/><br/>Unhealthy Occupation: Academical PCs are asked to catalog a library of a deceased dude. He is not (technically) deceased.  This is location based and very loosely structured.<br/><br/>The Unspeakable Oath <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2312&amp;Mode=like">#12</a> (1995)<br/><br/>Roadkill: I could forgive the "strange monster darts unavoidably in front of your car, causing you to break down far from home with only the creepy house nearby for shelter" setup, since, you know, it's a setup and it's a classic horror setup, buuuuttt.... the sheer amount of "stuff that happens that the investigators can't stop/deal with" is high here. Gonna call it Railroading.<br/><br/>The Revival: A dude tries to sacrifice a whole trainload of people in an isolated Northwest Territories mining town.  I like the unique setting here, but the amount of "you didn't do this? welp, don't worry, someone else did and they will tell you all about it" goes way beyond just interconnected scenario design. I'm VERY comfortable calling this one a Magician's Choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397880/#Comment_397880" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T16:46:49+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  4:46PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the Magician's Choice again?<br/><br/>(Also, I can go over Cthulhu Classics, Fatal Experiments, Tales of Lovecraft County, and Dreamlands over the next few days or week.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397883/#Comment_397883" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T17:01:27+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  5:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2012 5:02PM by komradebob.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What's the Magician's Choice again?</blockquote>\nI think it's similar to the old magic trick principle called The Force. Ever learn that trick as a kid where you write down a playing card, seal up the note in an envelope, then layout all of the cards in some fashion and tell your pal to pick certain rows or columns?Then you remove some. It goes a couple of times usually, but inevitably, the final card left is exactly the card you wrote down!<br/><br/>How does it work? Well, if you've got three rows of cards, and you ask them to pick one, what you do next depends on whther they picked a row with your chosen card in it. Anyway, it ends up with cards removed at each step, always inevitably leaving the card you wanted them to choose ("predicted") at the end of the trick.<br/><br/>In gaming, it's a bit like moving around clues or otherwise limiting the flow of play, based on what the players do.

If they don't get it on their own, the Keeper passes it along anyway, which sounds like a Magician's Choice/Force effect.<br/><br/>Of course, if they don't make the Spot Hidden roll on their own, they also don't have that opportunity post-adventure to roll to advance their Spot Hidden skill from it either. Or, at least, not from that particular roll opportunity.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, no one in this thread has mentioned how skill advancement and successful skill rolls play together have they?<br/><br/>I wonder if that explains some of those choke points...<br/><br/>Oh good ggogly-moogly! Could that be the actual explanation for some of this nonsense????

It gives more PCs a chance to be the one to use the skill successfully.<br/><br/>One successful skill check lets you mark the skill for a post-adventure skill upgrade.<br/><br/>I have had players actually game that sort of thing a bit, too ( although we tended to be a bit casual rather than deeply immersion-y in our play anyway).<br/><br/>If multiple PCs go to the Boston Library at the same time, it will give better chances of success, better chances for advancement,  and save time ( although it means they can't do something else at the same time).<br/><br/>It could, however, explain weird choke points, like a clue you need a Botany roll success to gain.

Usually people shoot for a kinda open ended campaign, with character advancement.<br/><br/>CoC, at least the older versions I'm familiar with, only have advancement through successful skill use during the adventure (followed by a failed roll after the adventure ends).<br/><br/>It does make creating characters a bit tricky and gambley. You want commonly used skills high enough that you have a good chance of using them successfully, accepting you won't advance quickly in them, but you still want a spread of lesser, but useful skills, at a level where you have a half way decent chance to use them successfully and advance them faster.<br/><br/>Some of those lesser skills are rarely used. Does explain why CoC PCs tend to be such pencil necked geeks though. For a game that isn't supposedly about combat, over the course of a campaign, you'll have all kinds of ability to advance combat and physical skills. from relatively low levels.<br/><br/>When it's time to read that ancient greek text, ya kinda need to get it right the first try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397911/#Comment_397911" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T19:04:16+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  7:04PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I can see it coming from an assumption that all five investigators will show up at the library and go to work, but you can still let them all roll even if you just need one successful roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397918/#Comment_397918" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T20:46:47+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  8:46PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2012 8:50PM by Scrape.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's particularly strange that players could get frustrated and fail at The Haunting, because it explicitly gives the keeper the ability to use poltergeist activity to lure the PCs around the house.

And I definitely find myself using the magician's force trick but my players don't notice or mind. I think when you're signing up for CoC, you're after a particular experience and it's definitely <i>not</i> sandbox play. In fact, I tell my players beforehand: "We are playing a Horror Game. You should make decisions as if this were a scary movie. Where a reasonable person would Not Open The Closet, you should open it. Your characters are only meant to last the 2-3 sessions it will take to finish this scenario. It will be fun." I think the book should come right out and say this, if it's gonna be honest, because it's pretty vital to a successful game in my opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397925/#Comment_397925" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T21:37:10+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  9:37PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2012 9:38PM by Johnstone.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, both versions of "The Haunted House" say that the poltergeist activity is meant to keep the investigators <i>away</i> from the basement. The bad guy uses it as a distraction if they're getting close to him (although, once somebody goes out the window, it's probably natural for players to look for alternate avenues of investigation!). Your techniques are good, but they're not there in the adventure.<br/><br/>Also, looking at the 5e version again, there's this in there:<br/>"The main library has several interesting items tucked away, but the investigators must find each one with a separate Library Use roll. [a list of four clues.] Each item takes four hours to find, and each is in a different newspaper."<br/><br/>This strike me as quite similar to rolls in old-school D&amp;D, where you have a base 1-in-6 chance to open a locked door, and failing just means you take 1 turn in the attempt, but you can try again. Since time passing means you use up torches and the DM rolls for wandering monsters, it's basically a way of playing the odds in small increments. Thing is, it doesn't really matter how long the investigators spend at the library. Or poking around the house, for that matter. So it's an odd basis to use for pacing out the action (although understandable, given the time these were written).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397938/#Comment_397938" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T02:24:52+00:00" title="November 18, 2012  2:24AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An aside: <br/><br/>I've been reading this thread, nodding along to some comments (particularly Eero and Jonathan) while being a bit mystified by others (particularly Jason and Johnstone).

And it really needs to be locked down, and easily understood straight out of the gate. And, maybe, it needs to be in a different format than the traditional "buried somewhere in the book" ( including at the front of the book, which really is just as likely to be skipped).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398239/#Comment_398239" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T15:33:56+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  3:33PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first experiences with CoC play was what I'd call "dungeon style" and involved the sort of location-centric sorts of adventures like the Haunted house that JD cites (I believe that was the first CoC adventure I ever played). These were never interesting to me, because what they involve is player participation to solve the mystery. Meaning you can fail to solve the mystery. I'm just not interested in that sort of challenge, and it didn't strike me playing CoC that this is what it should be about. Note that my play of CoC lead to me reading HPL, not the other way around. So I can't claim that I had some expectation of it being like the literature. It's just that I expected horror, and never got anything like that. <br/><br/>I don't want such a game to be at all about player challenge, personally, because that puts me in an adversarial mindset where it's impossible to feel any sense of horror. Just like when I go to a horror movie, and challenge myself not to be scared. If I do that, I won't be scared. And then what's the point? When I play a horror game, I want to "play appropriately stupid," as I've quoted before. Which actually means that I want to play my character as an interestingly fallible being who makes the sort of mistakes that a real human would if they were to encounter such horrors. I just can't do that if I'm trying to "win" the scenario. <br/><br/>So usually I didn't win the scenario, meaning that we usually didn't even discover the horrific bits. Oh, actually I would end up pushing the limits of my own belief on what my character might do in order to get more info, just so that we might encounter the horrific stuff. But even then, we often "lost." <br/><br/>This is also the problem with any scenario that expects a lot of fighting to occur. Nothing in CoC games was less horrific than lots of die rolling to see how many hit points of damage I was doing. Dull. I'd rather play D&amp;D if the game is going to be that way... and that's a big condemnation coming from me. It's not that I find combat a problem with the genre or something. It's that the old-school system makes it feel gamey again. Get the shotgun, it does more damage. Ack. <br/><br/>Then there were scenarios that have the "Force" used in them. These come in two varieties, generally. In the case of finding the car, the issue is that it's not a magician's force, it's an obvious force. Oh, you failed your roll? Well you succeed anyway. Why did we bother rolling then? Sincerely, if you're intent on getting a player the info, just give them the info. This is completely non-controversial. All GM's do it with most info all the time. Take the Haunted House scenario, for instance. It begins with somebody coming to get the PCs to help. This could be written such that there's a story in the paper, and the GM could require the players to roll to notice the story, with the attendant chance that the scenario never happens. But why would you do that? <br/><br/>Each roll should have a purpose, an interesting branching that occurs if it is failed. As Jonathan says, something consequential. Else don't bother to roll. As described, the roll to find the car could be framed as an attempt to look better than the local cops or something, and that's fine. It's just that as the scenario posits it, it's not interesting. <br/><br/>The other sort of force is the sort that's done surreptitiously. The problem with this is that the players know. At least I always did, and all of my players always did when I was doing it. They even commented on it in ways that I knew meant that they weren't comfortable with it. They knew I was railroading behind the scenes, and it bothered them. All illusionism does is to make players uncertain of how much agency they have, which is a far cry from giving them actual agency. In the last thread I gave the example of the scene in At the Mountains of Madness that gives an explicit description of how to do exactly this sort of magician's force to get something to happen "right." <br/><br/>Are some scenarios better, and some worse? Of course. The issue that I, at least, was on about was not that one couldn't possibly have come up with a functional way to play these scenarios, perhaps using advice from the book, or coming up with technique. My point was that all of the play that I actually encountered was dysfunctional because of the culture of play that emerged at the time. And that has probably as much to do with trying to convert from playing D&amp;D as it did with anything else, as well as a number of other factors. <br/><br/>But the scenarios, as written, contributed to that problem. Was there a way that they could have been written to fight the problem? Well, yes, but I don't believe that anyone had the understanding of RPG play needed to have accomplished this at the time. That is, nobody could have done better than what was done at the time. I don't blame anyone for the content, in fact CoC adventures were much better than much of the other stuff coming out at the time (somebody mentioned Ravenloft, for instance). <br/><br/>What it does mean, and to answer Steve Dempsey's question about what this thread is good for, is that we can think about how we write scenarios, and do better in the future (if that's what folks are doing). <br/><br/><br/>Next I'll give an idea of what I'm talking about...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398240/#Comment_398240" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T15:34:11+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  3:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll give an example of how one can improve on the old CoC module writing methods. The first is that there's a tendency to write them as though they are something like a storyboard. That is, they tend to use language like "Then this happens." This suggests that either you are going to force the players to do X, or that there's a timeline for NPCs (like was mentioned above) that means that there's some real universe going on behind the scenes that make X necessarily happen at this time. Now, when reading these adventures, I mentally edit these texts to say what I think the writers really mean. Which is something like, "At this time it would probably be interesting for X to happen, but as always you have to take into account what has gone before, and what the current situation is like, and determine if in fact maybe something else might be more interesting or appropriate at this juncture." <br/><br/>Now, all of that would take a lot to write added on to every sentence, and the notion is that the GM is supposed to be smart enough to edit this in. But this doesn't make for an efficient presentation. And the solution is simply to present the information to the GM as ideas for them to use. Events should be presented in the format where at the top it says, "When appropriate here are several horrific events to throw at the investigators as responses to their actions." And then simply list the events. Sure, put them in an interesting chronological order that might work, but have the understanding that there is no "reality" behind the scenario that the GM has to follow, and that the GM is following the player lead, and allowing things to develop naturally. <br/><br/>Yeah, this can be R-map and Bangs. Or it can be less about theme if that's your thing, and the events can be meant to provoke player challenge, or simply horror etc. Make your scenarios do what you want. But ALL of the information in a scenario should be presented in such a way as to facilitate the GM being able to provide players with a chance to interact in some meaningful way. Anything that's in a scenario that's there to just get characters from point A to B should NOT be presented as an option, but should use overt GM authority. Such as you use when you present the scenario to them as a "this is what we're doing tonight." <br/><br/>Terminology aside, call it force or authority or whatever, if the GM is using the powers that the game gives them to move the situation to a place where the players are enabled to interact in interesting ways, it's a good thing. If the GM is using their powers to make the interesting decisions themselves, or generally to make it so that the players aren't feeling that they are actually participating, it's a bad thing (barring a theoretical sort of player who likes this sort of treatment). <br/><br/>Just make sure that the scenario does whatever it can to inform the GM of how to use the information therein to accomplish this goal.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398243/#Comment_398243" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T16:03:41+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  4:03PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2012 4:05PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do think there's an element of competitiveness in CoC scenarios, insofar as there are rewards for exploring/beating what we would call today "side quests", and honestly the "here's what happens if you lose" text at the end was probably the best part for me as a player because it meant that I knew up front that there was a possibility that I would fuck up playing this game and everything would melt down.  Definitely a matter of taste - if you don't like that sword of Damocles hanging over your head when you roll those ten-siders that might come up shit for the fourth time in a row and leave me doomed, then it was not a good thing to add.<br/><br/>As for "why roll if you were going to get the info anyway", there's putting the check next to the skill (which I'm not sure is a good reason), and there's...<br/><br/>... just simple portrayal of an investigation. Like, it seems contradictory to me, Mike, that you are deeply concerned that every single roll in the game be significant but that you feel you can't portray the psychology of a frightened person accurately and still participate in the game, since surely they would just run away at the first sign of trouble. Thus roleplaying "realistically" (instead of like an investigating character in a Lovecraft story) would inevitably lead to a "loss."  Investigations in real life sometimes (always) have dead ends and sometimes if there's more than one thing going on there's more than one way to get to a particular place.  Like, if you crave realism in your portrayal of the character, why don't you crave realism in the GM's portrayal of the world?  There's a 60 percent chance the PCs find the car (or whatever it adds up to), but if they don't, the locals will.  That seems like a fairly normal statement about something that might actually happen. It doesn't necessarily make for good/great/honest <i>drama</i>, but if that's the goal, why is having a character who doesn't want to investigate anymore not just as problematic?<br/><br/>I'll get back to the list tonight hopefully!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398261/#Comment_398261" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T19:38:17+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  7:38PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2012 7:41PM by Johnstone.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Cthulhu Classics: Shadows of Yog-Sothoth</b><br/><br/>This is a seven-part campaign which reveals a globe-spanning conspiracy that ends in R'lyeh. It was originally published in 1982.<br/><br/><b>1. The Hermetic Order of the Silver Twilight</b><br/>Beginning the whole campaign requires that the investigators join the Order (a nefarious manqu\xe9 of the Golden Dawn). They will either have to become suspicious and do some investigations of the Order on their own, or another member will come to them with some suspicions. Since there are no examples given of behaviour that might alert the investigators, and it takes several successful rolls in order to get to the really interesting info, either the NPC dude will have to turn to the PCs, or they will have to decide on their own to explore the parts of their Order's clubhouse that they are not allowed to see.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much the meat of this scenario\u2014wandering around the Order's HQ. It's pretty heavy on the dungeon-crawl aspect, and if the investigators are just going to end up breaking in anyway, I'm not sure why they have to join the Order? Maybe that justifies the explanations of ranks and initiation rituals? It lets them recognize the two major NPC villains, at least, but one of them has to escape so he can become a recurring villain in later adventures. This scenario helps the Keeper out here by making the less-powerful villain a front-man and a fall guy, and giving the other guy the opportunity to escape through magic. Which is still kind of dumb.<br/><br/><b>2. Look to the Future</b><br/>A dude asks the investigators to check out this organization and their HQ, and that's it. The entire scenario consists of going to a building and finding some strange stuff there, without the possibility of any research.<br/><br/>There is a clue in this adventure that relates to the later adventures, but mostly there is just the opportunity to acquire an assault rifle from the future and get eated by a shoggoth. If the investigators actually decide not to investigate this organization's HQ, that is a perfectly valid option, especially because it does not lead directly to any other adventures in this campaign, and they all start the same way this one does.<br/><br/><b>3. The Coven of Cannich</b><br/>A dude thinks his uncle is in danger in Scotland so the investigators check it out. The uncle has a house and an archaeological dig for them to investigate, and hopefully they will find the macguffin, or at least a part of it, because it is in several pieces. If they don't get all the pieces, the bad guys get the others.<br/><br/>There are a crap-ton of NPCs in this scenario, which gives the Keeper ample opportunity to have the investigators do lots of interaction. Pretty much the only way they will get a lead on the bad guys is by being attacked by them or by talking to the local NPCs.<br/><br/><b>4. Devil's Canyon</b><br/>A movie producer hires the investigators to find out what killed his director and is haunting his movie set. Honestly, having the von Stroheim manqu\xe9 be dead before the adventure starts is not the best idea one can have when writing an adventure.<br/><br/>If the investigators roll for shit or don't do much investigation, they can still go to the film set and look around, but they will have a hard time. One roll uncovers two pieces of information, including the location of the macguffin, a second roll uncovers the info for permanently exorcising the evil, which is almost impossible otherwise. They might still be able to "win" the scenario but it is unlikely, and there are no alternative sources for this info, so I'd say that's a choke point.<br/><br/><b>5. The Worm that Walks</b><br/>But that choke point is "okay" because if they didn't already get the required macguffins from the previous scenarios, the Keeper is supposed to put them in this one! Anyway, a dude who has heard of the investigators wants to meet up and compare notes, but actually the entire point of this scenario is to kill the investigators. The bad guys have become annoyed, and are trying to get rid of them. Why they have to lure them somewhere and can't just send somebody over to wherever they live, I don't know. How the investigators are supposed to stumble upon the macguffins while the bad guys are trying to ambush and murder them, I don't know, but once they figure things out, they will also find a clue that leads them to Easter Island. So this is basically a magician's railroad that either demolishes the choke points or ends the campaign.<br/><br/><b>6. The Watchers of Easter Island</b><br/>Coincidentally, there is a university expedition on Easter Island, awaiting the arrival of the investigators, because a bunch of them have gone missing. Some information can be gleaned from questioning people, but if they don't make friends with the natives, who give them hella gear and info, the rolls it takes to stumble upon the good stuff by accident are pretty ridiculous. Finding the missing people is also pretty hard. Overall, I'd say it's legitimate to call it a choke point. It's probably because winning or losing this scenario affects the next one, which is also inevitable.<br/><br/><b>7. The Rise of R'lyeh</b><br/>Exactly what the title says, but in order to avoid the end of the world, the investigators need the various macguffins and spells to be found in the previous scenarios. "While poring over this stuff, they may each attempt a Cthulhu Mythos roll. If any succeed, then they will be able to figure out a potential use for their materials. If all of them fail, then the keeper will need to give the information to them in some other way."<br/><br/>So that's Shadows of Yog-Sothoth. One of the scenarios is actually pretty good (#3), while others are either just location-based or have only one particular way to gain the information necessary to complete them. It's also weirdly coincidental that the investigators keep getting unrelated requests that all turn out to be linked to a larger conspiracy, instead of finding links within the different scenarios themselves.<br/><br/>There is a more-favourable review <a href="http://www.ogrecave.com/reviews/shadows_yog.shtml" rel="nofollow">at the Ogre Cave.</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398267/#Comment_398267" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T20:34:07+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  8:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mike, can you do a simple mockup of what you think your idea would look like?<br/><br/>Nothing extensive, or anything.

The focus wasn't Investigating, although, theoretically, the two games I have in mind did have ways to "win" where "win" = "survive in a less than hellish state and maybe figure out what was going on".<br/><br/>In neither game did we "win". In both, it mattered to us that, in theory, we could have. We went into it for the horror and the roleplaying, so we weren't optimizing for investigation. Indeed, one scenario, "Hysteria", was horrific even before the mythos elements. The PCs were all women who had been institutionalized in the late 19th century. And, the odds of these somewhat broken characters actually putting together all the pieces of the puzzle, given how enthusiastically we were playing the brokenness, was on the slim side.<br/><br/>So, what we had in these scenarios was a situation where we could investigate, succeeding or not, and if we were on the ball, yes, there was a satisfying solution to the mystery. But, we didn't need to hit that level for satisfactory play. We did, however, need for it to be there.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what this shows, apart from the kinds of scenarios I like to play in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398274/#Comment_398274" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T22:26:05+00:00" title="November 20, 2012 10:26PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continuing <i>Cthulhu Classics</i>...<br/><br/><b>The Warren</b><br/>Dude goes missing and the investigators check it out. This scenario was originally published in 1982 with Shadows of Yog-Sothoth. It advises that investigators looking for clues "must also look in the proper sequence, and the keeper should strive to keep them on the proper trail for at least part of the way through the clues list." It then gives a numbered list of a dozen clues.<br/><br/>The players can skip all of this and go straight to the location mentioned in the setup, where they find the monster. At some point however, one dude "will, by hook, crook, or force, make the characters precede him to warren room eleven, the altar room," where he will deliver a classic villainous monologue. Unfortunately, this one qualifies for railroading.<br/><br/><b>The Pits of Bendal-Dolum</b><br/>An expedition in British Honduras (Belize) leads to Bendal-Dolum. Getting there is a linear journey, but is easy to follow. There is a macguffin that allows access to the rest of the adventure, and if the investigators don't find it, and NPC will. Inevitably, the investigators will be transported to strange worlds and will have little choice but to keep exploring further. They will be railroaded towards a confrontation with the bad guy, although that is partly because it is the bad guy railroading them through his magic and minions, not the Keeper doing it simply for the sake of the plot. The result is pretty much the same, however, and he gets to make a villainous monologue before the investigators have the chance to defeat him.<br/><br/><b>Temple of the Moon</b><br/>Somebody sends an artifact to the investigators for safe keeping, but gets attacked before he can collect it. Then he spills the beans about an archaeological dig and the scenario assumes that the investigators will have to convince him to go with them, instead of vice versa.<br/><br/>Once the investigators get to the dig site, the adventure becomes a dungeoncrawl. On the way there, however, they will be followed and harassed by several different groups of NPCs. They all have motivations and tactics listed, and what they will attempt to do is described at each point, so the Keeper doesn't just have to make all this stuff up. How the adventure plays out depends partly on how the investigators interact with them, and how well their exploration of the once-secret places goes.<br/><br/><b>Dark Carnival</b><br/>This scenario features a carnival with a dark secret. It's mostly a collection of NPCs in a single location that the investigators can explore, but the real secret is the secret lair. There are nine different ways to find the secret lair. Most of the paperwork research is provided up-front to the investigators, leaving only the questioning of people and the searching of their properties.<br/><br/><b>The Secret of Castronegro</b><br/>A friend from Location 1 goes missing. The investigators get a handout that mentions three disappearances in Location 2 and mentions Location 3. In Location 1 there are two clues leading to Location 2, one needs a roll the other doesn't. A third clue leads to Location 3 but "should not be easy," requiring rolls and bribes. There are also two clues that mention the bad guy, which require rolls, one of which can also be found in Location 2. In Location 2 there are three clues that lead to Location 3. They require rolls and one requires communicating with people on the other side of the country. Once in Location 3, the investigators have no obstructions to finding out the secret by wandering around save for the bad guy who tries to kill them, which pretty much prevents them from failing to complete the investigation unless they pack it in and just leave.<br/><br/>So my tally for this book is:<br/>Shadows of Yog-Sothoth: Some magician's choices to overcome chokepoints.<br/>The Warren: Some railroading.<br/>The Pits of Bendal-Dolum: Railroading by bad guy.<br/>Temple of the Moon: Nothing.<br/>Dark Carnival: Nothing.<br/>The Secret of Castronegro: Nothing.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398310/#Comment_398310" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T07:35:41+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  7:35AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike:<br/><br/>Are you familiar with Unspeakable Oath magazine?<br/><br/>It does tend to be the sort of thing that you really need to be an incredible CoC geek to have encountered.<br/><br/>I mention it becasue there were a couple of things that were in it that start to come close to a bit of what you're mentioning, at least in broad outline.<br/><br/>One was the Fragments of Fear articles/column ( I hope I'm remembering that name correctly).

IMR is a classic one-shot, with a strong set-up, pregens with motives ( horrible ones that I suspect will encourage players to go for broke and play their characters to destruction willingly), and what amounts to suggestions for possible/probable events in a vague sort of chronological order.<br/><br/>The ending is very open ended, to the extent that the adventure basically tells the GM to roll with whatever the players are coming up with and fold it all in.<br/><br/>It also sounds a whole lot like what you've been stabbing at upthread.<br/><br/>Warning: If you go looking for it, know that it's a pretty damn gruesome adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398317/#Comment_398317" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T08:42:36+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  8:42AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It does tend to be the sort of thing that you really need to be an incredible CoC geek to have encountered.<br/></blockquote>\nHEY<br/><br/>(It's a fair cop.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398319/#Comment_398319" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T08:55:38+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  8:55AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>It does tend to be the sort of thing that you really need to be an incredible CoC geek to have encountered.<br/></blockquote>\nHEY<br/><br/>(It's a fair cop.)<br/><br/></blockquote>\nOn a tangent, it does make me wonder how the impact of magazines differed from the impact of internet discussions on how people play games, and what they expect the game text to be like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398326/#Comment_398326" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T09:45:45+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  9:45AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote> There you go, don't play Call of Cthulhu ever. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nWe could probably have an entire thread about picking the right people to play a certain game.<br/><br/>Such important advice, so obvious, and yet so often overlooked w/r/t RPGs.</blockquote>\nSustained self-awareness is hard.

In fact, I've run pretty much the same scenario three times now based on that first improvisation. Each time it runs in a similar way but there are always different loose ends which the groups picks up on and which lead down different avenues of investigation. What this requires from me is a very good knowledge of London in the 1930s, the Book of the Smoke and the Cthulhu Mythos, as well as occult practices of the period. Had I been required to set it in Baltimore in 1957, it just wouldn't have worked.<br/><br/>Hell, even my two-page twenty-minute demo game for Trail of Cthulhu requires a fairly heavy hand on the tiller to avoid it spinning of into a four hour epic. And what do I know about Indiana in 1934 (well, quite a lot now I've placed other scenarios there).<br/><br/>One of the biggest issues with Mythos gaming is verisimilitude and it's very hard to achieve if the players know something about the period and or location and you don't. Mythos players are often huge history buffs. I think that's part of the reason for the relative narrowness in much of the published material. Another is that much Mythos play is focussed on playing the character to the hilt and dying an interesting death. Although from the GMs point of view the scenario may look simplistic, the players are so busy with the madness, death and being bitchy 1930s dilletantes at each other that they don't realise that the game is A-&gt;B-&gt;C.<br/><br/>That said, I'd much rather have something like the Armitage Files which gives hooks and develops items, locations and NPCs in several different ways. I'm an expressive GM. I want to play with the material too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398393/#Comment_398393" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T22:23:48+00:00" title="November 21, 2012 10:23PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Unspeakable Oath still exists and subscriptions are available.

I may have to check it out.<br/><br/>JD... I really don't understand your comments about "running away" and such. I'm not even sure what it is that I said to which you're responding. To be clear, I want play to be dramatic. I want to portray my character "appropriately stupidly" as I've said more than once. Meaning that as the audience is shouting, "Don't go in there!" at the movie screen, I'm having my investigator is go in there. And while I as a player know that it's likely a really bad idea to read the musty old tome, I'm going to have my character do it anyway, more often than not. <br/><br/>And I love bad endings. I like con games very much, because there's zero expectation of ever playing that character again, and I can drive my character right into the grave without worrying about it. What I don't like is when my character ends up in the grave due to some botched die roll when climbing a ladder (OK that happened to my friend Dave, but it's why he quit the game), and not getting to the really horrific stuff. <br/><br/>Bob, this is how I write up all my adventures these days. I could maybe send one to you if you I could get an email somehow (obviously don't post it here publicly). <br/><br/>But to give an idea I hunted up a free adventure to rewrite. It can be found on the Chaosium site here: <a href="https://catalog.chaosium.com/fdm_file_detail.php?file_id=22" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://catalog.chaosium.com/fdm_file_detail.php?file_id=22</a><br/><br/>(if not already a customer there, you'll have to register)<br/><br/>The part labeled "The Investigation" is done pretty well, though I would have broken it up into subheaders myself. A part that I think could use rewriting is the section that amounts to a timeline labeled "The Action." It explicitly lays out the action in terms of what will happen each of the five days after the investigators arrive. Day One says that things "will be relatively uneventful." Day two says that the investigators "probably go to town." What's inexplicable about this is that there's no particular reason why the first day has to be uneventful, or the investigators have to go to town on the second day. Zeke can set up his terror bombing without them leaving. But even if you assume that there's a need to have the investigators leave to set something like this up, you still don't have to presume that it happens on Day two. <br/><br/>Next post I'll give what I think is a better write up...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398573/#Comment_398573" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-24T09:46:07+00:00" title="November 24, 2012  9:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2012 9:49AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A better rewriting of this event:<br/><br/> - Zeke's Terror Bombing - <br/>At some point when the investigators are inside the house, probably after they've had some time to settle in a bit (perhaps after coming back from a run to town) and Zeke has some time to slip away and prepare, he heads outside to a prepared hole in the ground with a tarp over it. In this hole he has stored several very old bones, including a skull (all of which Zeke dug up some time ago), a slingshot, and 10 glasses of acid mixed with green phosphorescent materia. The glasses are painted black and have cardboard covers. <br/><br/>He first takes the glasses and places then in front of the front door of the house, such that anyone emerging will likely upturn them, the light cardboard covers on top to prevent the green light from being seen until they are tipped. Previously he has removed the entryway light, so as to make the vials even harder to see, and to make knocking them over even more likely. If the investigators go out the front door carefully, they may attempt a spot hidden roll to avoid knocking the glasses over - those charging out do not even get to roll. Each investigator who does not notice the glasses (unwarned by other investigators) has a 50% of knocking over a glass on the way out and a 25% chance of knocking over two glasses. For each glass knocked over, the investigator may roll a luck roll and avoid damage on a roll of 01. Each glass knocked over by an investigator causes 1d6 damage that turn, and 1d3 damage the next, and creates an eerie glow on the investigator and the entryway. <br/><br/>After placing these glasses, Zeke retreats to the bushes and fires the bones at the house with the slingshot to draw the investigators out. The Eater, knowing this is going on, will be sure to feign horror and draw attention to the sounds, in such a way as to try to get the investigators to rush out and see what is going on. Zeke will save the skull to toss at the investigators if they do come out, and then retreat to the tarp-covered pit and hide there.<br/><br/><br/>Note several things. There's no assumption of the response by the investigators, just what the bad guys' plan is, and how they are trying to get it to come to it's fruition. I've included it with a subheading as part of a presumed list of potential events. I've included the location of the materials used in the plan, such that they might be found by investigators who study the area closely before the event. It does not talk about "if investigators find the bones" instead just setting up the situation with all information needed for the investigator to dole out as needed. I haven't included the bit about the police, as this should be included as a general note elsewhere in the background (that any investigations they make based on evidence early on will be fruitless). If at all. <br/><br/>And, there's no assumption about when this will happen, just notes on the plan so that the Keeper can figure out for himself when the best time is for this to occur. Texts like this seem to assume that they know best how to pace the horror, but they can't possibly really know before hand, as the designer of the scenario can't really know what events are going to occur. Unless we presume that the Keeper is going to using railroading techniques to ensure this happens.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398580/#Comment_398580" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-24T12:00:43+00:00" title="November 24, 2012 12:00PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, this is what I was replying to:\n<blockquote> When I play a horror game, I want to "play appropriately stupid," as I've quoted before.

But I'll try to just answer just the last sentence. <br/><br/>There is a power disparity between players and GMs in a traditional game setup (which is intentional, and often a very beneficial thing). If a player attempts to find something, and misses it, it's because they either didn't meet a player challenge to look in the right place, or they simply missed a roll. If the NPCs find a thing, did the GM have them roll? Likely not, this decision will be made by fiat (if they do roll, then we have a potential bottleneck again). Why make this decision? Was it because the police "would" look there, and it would be unrealistic for them not to find the thing? Well the PCs failed, so apparently it wasn't a sure thing to find it. <br/><br/>It's apparent that the GM is making this decision to move the plot onwards. Which means that the plot would have moved onward no matter what the PC did. For players like me, this feels like we are not participating in a meaningful way. <br/><br/>Note that as I've already said, I'm really not all that concerned with rolls, since the player doesn't really contribute to the success or failure of the roll in most cases (the GM can assume that the player's comments about how they're looking or where may warrant a bonus perhaps, but mostly it's just a die roll). And whether or not my character finds something is not the sort of thing I'm particularly worried about contributing to in play (the question of whether we win). As I've said, I would prefer in this case just to find the vehicle, and have no chance of failure (ala Gumshoe). Simply having the roll is where the problem starts. What's the purpose of failing? If there's no interesting output from failure, if the end result will be the same in either case, then why have the roll at all? <br/><br/>(BTW, I've always detested the advancement rules for CoC, as it leads to folks asking to attempt rolls even when there's no tension regarding the task at hand, simply to get a checkmark. So that's not helping in any way for me, personally. I suppose it's fine for those folks looking for a "tactical" CoC game, though.)<br/><br/>But this finding the car example is just one example of the sorts of things that happen, others of which DO affect the sorts of decisions that I want to make. Again, I've played with GMs who, having read these texts as being scripts that were to be followed, have railroaded us right to the end of the plot, using illusion methods that were plainly visible to everyone playing. Or more "honest" GMs who, when we miss a roll at a bottleneck (or maybe miss many rolls), simply have the adventure fail to reach any interesting conclusion. Intelligent, well-meaning GMs. <br/><br/>Trying to think of a good railroading example (I've given multiple bottleneck situations from actual play). I recall one example in a convention game where I was playing a plucky newspaper guy... sorta the everyman hero of the story. I made every attempt to get him killed off, including climbing up on a building above the mouth of a mythos horror in the garden below with waving tentacles and all (don't ask me why I tried this, I don't recall, but I was pretty sure it would look heroic, and would get him swallowed in horrific fashion). The GM actually decided by fiat that my character survived the monster. No rolls, he just had me sort of suspended there until the rest of the investigators managed to banish the horror with a ritual. <br/><br/>I was crushed. I actually said something like "I survive?" (several of the other players were flabbergasted as well). He then had a little set-piece epilogue to the scenario which involved my character marrying one of the others, and eventually our lives falling apart because of the memory of the events of the adventure. It became clear that the GM simply wanted to have his story play out in the way he'd written it, and it was too close to the end for me to ruin it by getting my character killed in the way I wanted. <br/><br/>Yeah, I don't think this was a published adventure, but he got the notion that this sort of plot engineering is OK from somewhere.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398620/#Comment_398620" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T00:53:56+00:00" title="November 25, 2012 12:53AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2012 12:54AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike &amp; JD, here's my two cents:<br/><br/>I think CoC has been played as two basic games:<br/><br/><b>Call of Cthulhu: the Reacting</b><br/>As a player, success and failure are effectively out of my hands, but I get lots of cool fodder for roleplaying the confrontation with cosmic horror and the descent into madness.  (Or cool 1920s stuff that I dig; whatever it is that I like about Lovecraft fiction.)<br/><br/><b>Call of Cthulhu: the Solving</b><br/>As a player, I put myself in the investigator's shoes and use my wits to unravel the mystery before it's too late.<br/><br/>The post-game summary of the fiction might look the same, but what I do to contribute as a player is quite different.  It's the opportunity for those contributions that will make or break the game for me.<br/><br/>So, Mike's playing the Reacting.  GM fiat and dice luck are fine for some things, but <i>not</i> if they take away his opportunity to encounter and react to cool Lovecraftiana.<br/><br/>JD's points, regarding player agency to choose a direction, are potentially quite germane to the Solving, but are probably irrelevant to the Reacting.<br/><br/>This is my biggest gripe with CoC: it often fails to get the group (or even a given player!) on the same page about what mode they're playing in.  There's an abundance of content that seems to beg for clever solution, yet the game isn't <i>really</i> a solvable puzzle, and GMs and players are often split between trying to <i>make</i> it a solvable puzzle versus just digging into the atmosphere and freaky happenings like good Lovecraft protagonists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398631/#Comment_398631" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T06:22:02+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  6:22AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2012 6:37AM by komradebob.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David:<br/><br/>I think what we're seeing in general is that getting players on the same page seems to be part of the problem for folks who've had problems with CoC.<br/><br/>Again, I wonder how much of this is related to gamer culture overall.<br/>(Edited to add and clarify):<br/>Campaigns as a concept are really important in gamer culture, especially open ended campaigns, and CoC does have some problems fitting neatly into that concept. Character advancement tends to go along with concept, too, and maybe some of that is a worse fit than we're giving credit for in the CoC mechanics.<br/><br/>The other problem is that this stuff, in fail-states, tends to do all sorts of violence not just to a campaign's potential, but to the setting itself if you aren't really committed to the concept of one-shots. The players failing to stop the horror in some fashion can be about on par with letting them kill Hitler- it's kinda problematic. if you're trying to tie things all together and continue in the setting as it stands.<br/><br/>____________<br/>Here may be some insight, and I'm not sure about what it implies exactly, and I do wonder how much of this is common with other CoC GMs.<br/><br/>As a CoC GM, I feel I'm working with a basic 3 part adventure structure, and it's my job to get the group as a whole through all three parts of that. <br/>The set up and initial investigation<br/>The middle part where action revs up and things become time relevent and clues fall into place<br/>The big showdown and/or wrap up of some sort<br/><br/>I doubt I'm the olnly CoC GM who feels that this is the basics of what they're dealing with.<br/><br/>If indeed that is the case, then maybe the better questions become "what are the tools to use for that?"<br/><br/>A choke point becomes then something that ultimately stops the game from moving from one part to the next.<br/><br/><br/>I guess a key question I have is : Does anyone disagree that this is the core adventure set up concept for CoC?<br/><br/>Are players aware that this is the core concept?<br/><br/>Does anyone disagree with the idea that the CoC GM has a duty to make sure that the adventure moves from one part to the next if the player character's actions (and rolls) fail to produce that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398637/#Comment_398637" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T08:19:17+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  8:19AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I disagree.

I still think there's a problem in expecting all of the meaningful decisions in moving the game forward to be made by all the players <i>except one</i>, the GM, who must assiduously work to determine if the game's run into a wall so that the game can be stopped in a failure state and people take their Sanity penalties, but under no circumstances must he take action about any potential roadblocks he observes. But until I can work it out better, I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>I would just add that convention play is undeniably its own beast. When I run CoC at conventions, I ALWAYS say, "this is an introductory game, I will keep everyone in the game as long as possible - if you roll and you would die, and we're not at the end of the scenario yet, we'll just back up and do it over", because normally nobody at the table has played CoC before, or sometimes we have one semi-experienced person. So I would have taken your attempts to get horribly murdered as somewhat disruptive if done before the end of the scenario. (But then perhaps you might not have done them if I had explained my goal at the beginning.)<br/><br/>So, two more scenarios, these from Fragments of Fear, the Second Cthulhu Companion (1985):<br/><br/>The Underground Menace: There's a pretty significant chokepoint insofar as a Law or Fast Talk roll is necessary to get the name of the bad guy from a townsfolk and without that no progress can be made. (And this is the first step in the investigation - you literally can end the game at the first test!) But other than that there's just a bunch of different locations, monsters and badguys doing their thing.<br/><br/>Valley of the Four Shrines: The first half of this adventure is resource management/trading in order to progress. It's kind of unique, I can't think of another scenario like it.  I guess it's possible to fail here if you didn't budget enough cash for your expedition into 1920s Africa!  That's kind of hilarious and apt.  The second half, exploring a horrible valley infested with zombies and Cthulhoid temples is UNBELIEVABLY deadly. Like...I can't see anyone making it out alive. But there's no railroading or anything in it. What's interesting is that there is no Sanity penalty for failing this adventure. It's an isolated spot and it's been horrible for hundreds (thousands?) of years, so fleeing the area in terror is not necessarily a "loss", insofar as the status quo is not threatened.  This is pretty unique, I can't think of another scenario like this one in any way.  So I'm going with "nothing" for this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398725/#Comment_398725" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T07:55:37+00:00" title="November 26, 2012  7:55AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, I never said that the GM can't advance the story. In fact that's their job IMO, to provide information that moves the story forward. What I'm saying is that it's bad when they advance the story in such a way as to take away player agency, instead of creating more. <br/><br/>Note that players can make the same mistake, too. They can, for example, refuse to engage with the adventure (or go off in a completely unwarranted direction, or any number of possible bad ideas). I agree wholeheartedly that agreeing to play a CoC adventure as a player means that you should adopt certain tropes and act in a certain way that's going to allow the GM to do their job as well. If you say that the investigators just stay home, you're sabotaging the adventure. <br/><br/>You're setting up a false dichotomy. That either the GM gets to advance the plot, or they don't. The GM gets to advance the plot; they need to. But they need to do it in such a way as to give the players as much opportunity to feel like they're making meaningful contributions to the action as possible. And the players have the responsibility to take the GM's information and run with it and ensure that the GM has an easy time with moving on to the next event. <br/><br/>It's a collaborative thing, or is best when it is, IMO. The problem is that too many GMs feel that players can't be trusted to advance the plot "properly" and so take it upon themselves to do it themselves, limiting player agency to ensure that this happens. The fact that the adventure plots are often written like this (as a series of events that happen in a specified order) has informed many a GM that this is the right way to proceed. <br/><br/>(Note, Johnstone, that I don't say "all" GMs behave this way. It's quite possible that I've just had atrocious luck with my GMs or something not having figured out a good way to run these scenarios. As I've said, I myself personally can mentally re-write these adventures to run them in a way that I hope is entertaining. But then I've thought a lot about this stuff, and there was a time I would have made all of the errors that I am speaking about.)<br/><br/>This is what I always tell GMs: good GMing is using your authority as GM to affect the world, NPCs, events, etc, in such a way as to create opportunities for players to collaboratively move the story forward. No differently than in more tactical RPGs where the GM's job is to set up tactical challenges for the players to have their characters face. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17532/analyzing-call-of-cthulhu-module-chokepoints-railroading" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17532/analyzing-call-of-cthulhu-module-chokepoints-railroading" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17532/analyzing-call-of-cthulhu-module-chokepoints-railroading/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17532/analyzing-call-of-cthulhu-module-chokepoints-railroading/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17532/analyzing-call-of-cthulhu-module-chokepoints-railroading/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17532/analyzing-call-of-cthulhu-module-chokepoints-railroading/p5">5</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17532/analyzing-call-of-cthulhu-module-chokepoints-railroading/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17532%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17532%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Analyzing Call of Cthulhu Module Chokepoints/Railroading - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17532/analyzing-call-of-cthulhu-module-chokepoints-railroading/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Analyzing Call of Cthulhu Module Chokepoints/Railroading - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17532/analyzing-call-of-cthulhu-module-chokepoints-railroading/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="You're setting up a false dichotomy.

But they need to do it in such a way as to give the players as much opportunity to feel like they're making meaningful contributions to the action as possible. And the players have the responsibility to take the GM's information and run with it and ensure that the GM has an easy time with moving on to the next event. </blockquote>\nIf it's how the players <i>feel</i> that's the issue (I have no feelings, so have little to say on the subject), then how is the "locals find the car if the PCs don't make their Spot Hidden roll" example objectionable? The players don't know there isn't another clue they might not have gotten if they'd made that roll, in fact, they probably suspect that there was. The GM doesn't read out loud the text that says that the car will be discovered no matter what, and the players only know that they didn't make a Spot Hidden roll while searching the desert.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398764/#Comment_398764" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T13:33:57+00:00" title="November 26, 2012  1:33PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good point. If I, a player at the table, don't know that the car is going to be found with all its clues intact no matter what, I'm probably going to have strong feelings about that Spot Hidden roll to find the car. <br/><br/>If I'm out searching the desert and find the car, I feel good -- look at me, I found it! I rule! Conversely, if I spent the whole day wandering around the desert like a dumbass with nothing to show for it and then the sheriff calls me and says, "Hey, dumbass, get out to mile marker 47, we found that car you were lookin' for," I feel bad -- jeez, I might be in over my head, who knows what other things I'm missing.<br/><br/>It's a <i>shorter</i> game if the GM just says "okay, you find the car, no roll required," there's no denying that. But it also doesn't give me any reason to feel any particular way about it; the car was just put in front of my character, and there's not much point in me deciding whether that makes him feel more or less confident about anything. When I blow a Spot Hidden roll an hour later to search a room, my buddies aren't going to make jokes about how it compares to our desert experience.<br/><br/>And no, those aren't vitally important elements to a good, fun, memorable game session, but they aren't terrible things to be avoided at all costs, either. It's like anything else, you figure out what the best use of your gaming time is. Personally, I figure that if we've got the time to set up a mood and make space for little character moments, we might as well, even if it's centered on a skill check that doesn't technically "mean" anything. When we don't have the time, we should just go ahead and skip right to the car.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398765/#Comment_398765" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T13:34:06+00:00" title="November 26, 2012  1:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, I like your post quite a bit - I don't actually have a thesis on how Call of Cthulhu modules are in some general sense (in the way that I did for Vampire 1ed.), this is more of an exploration/survey for me. I'm trying to find out how they generally are, if there are any patterns/etc.<br/><br/>I don't think the three-act structure quite fits, but as I say above, in convention games I always announce up front that we're not going to kill anyone off in the first hour or two and if that's how the dice come up, we're going to fix it.

It took me forever to track down any HPL, living in a small town and all.<br/><br/>When I did finally find some HPL and actually read it, my friends still hadn't. <br/><br/>I had to use something they were familiar with to explain the concept. That was pretty much either Scooby Doo or Kolchak, and even Kolchak was bit obscure at that point.<br/><br/>And, ya know, pretty much every similar kind of monster/action fiction film of the time that involved any sort of investigation. I'm sure the original Omen and the original Excorsist films were common points of reference as well.<br/><br/>So, wth those common points of reference a spart of the explanation, and with expectations set by inspirational source materials that tended to be one shots that came to some sort of conclusion, generally with some kind of showdown and/or after effects of that final confrontation, I GMed in a way that made sure those things happened.<br/><br/>Along the way, I picked up different kinds of techniques that helped that along.

I like the subheading for this one: "Wherein the investigators find that a plethora of clues and information may not always be helpful." LOLLLLLLL  Hilariously, there are four pieces of information the investigators get before they do literally anything, including a telegram saying "forget everything I said about how creepy/weird things are, everything's cool, don't come here". LOLLLLL again.  But in general, unless you think having multiple paths to information is magicians-force, this is one of the most interconnected, freeform CoC scenarios I've seen. There's a locations section, up to 3 monsters in different places with different triggering situations, and numerous NPCs all with their own histories and interactions with the story.  I'm calling this one Nothing.  Plus, the many blind leads, double-backs and fakeouts could lead them to a bathysphere!!!  Everyone loves a good bathysphere horror story.<br/><br/>In The Shadows Of Death: A doctor takes possession of an old crumbling plantation. AND GOES MAD, yep, it's a Gothic. Other than "no matter when the PCs arrive, it's raining", there's no railroading. OH NO THE WEATHER IS RAILROADED.  If the investigators miss clues, etc., then things get worse until there are monsters everywhere. What's interesting about this is that the evil people want to convince the investigators to leave. If they do, it's game over, you lose!  Kind of off-putting in a way. It sucks tension out of the evil people's actions.  But anyway, none of the normal railroading issues.<br/><br/>The Song Of The Spheres: This one is interesting because it takes place in a few parts that may be separated by days or weeks, just like a Lovecraft story. You can spread it out into a campaign or other modules. There are no railroading or magician's forces here. Most of the key clues you get just by showing up or by reading the paper.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399066/#Comment_399066" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T21:54:38+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  9:54PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm all for railroading the weather.

In the years I spent running Pagan Publishing, eliminating railroading was one of our major goals. We were seeing a lot of adventures published by Chaosium that felt like someone's screenplay with a die-roll chokepoint between each scene. So we very consciously set out to design adventures that were more like narrative landscapes where players had a lot of freedom. We didn't always succeed, but John Crowe's books such as <i>Walker in the Wastes</i> and <i>Realm of Shadows</i> were among our better examples.<br/><br/>That said, when I took a really big swing at a non-railroading adventure ("Dream Factory" in <i>Mortal Coils</i>) it took almost 30,000 words to cover all the likely avenues of investigation that players might take. And that's just a single adventure, not a campaign. It has a simple formula: a cast of NPCs who know various things, locations to explore, a timeline of what happens if nothing changes, and a couple of set pieces that can be triggered at a variety of points by player actions. But the result was so long and detailed that I doubt many groups have ever run it.<br/><br/>On the smaller scale, my short adventure "In Media Res" (from <i>Unspeakable Oath</i> 10, reprinted in <i>From the Vault</i>) is a very open scenario but it's not very investigatory. It's really just an improv piece where the players bounce off each other and occasionally find a new clue to have arguments about. It works great but it's a radical departure from typical CoC material. When I first ran it, one PC killed another in the first <i>twenty seconds</i>. I think that was a record.<br/><br/>I definitely saw railroading as the enemy. Our internal playtests tended to be extremely detailed investigation simulations where we might spend forty-five minutes just dissecting clues and strategizing our next steps. They were awesome intellectual challenges but not what every gaming group wants to do.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399415/#Comment_399415" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T04:46:11+00:00" title="December  3, 2012  4:46AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That said, when I took a really big swing at a non-railroading adventure ("Dream Factory" in <i>Mortal Coils</i>) it took almost 30,000 words to cover all the likely avenues of investigation that players might take.

A lot of earlier scenarios seem like they are just locations (like The Haunted House, for example), but in this book (1991) there's a concerted attempt to use timelines, large casts, and semi-optional "set piece" scenes. It really does feel like an attempt to branch out and make CoC adventures more complex and interesting.<br/><br/>I remember "Dream Factory" being a good adventure. I'm pretty sure I ran it once, but I can't remember who the PCs were or what happened. I think there was a long camera-disassembly scene where they tried every possible combination in order to see the monsters.<br/><br/>Do you recall which adventures you guys thought were railroad-y and screenplay-ish?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399505/#Comment_399505" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T20:08:32+00:00" title="December  3, 2012  8:08PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh god!

There's basically a bunch of PCs and a few NPCs with agendae.

For some reason I think that the source material for Dreamlands (basically being a phantasmagorical travelogue) almost NEEDS a nice solid railroad if we were going to go after it solidly (though of course the fictional world could be a great exploration/sandbox game, it would be nothing like the source material).  But someone who has read the Dreamlands stuff more recently can decide how we want to approach it.<br/><br/>Minions: 15 Brief Encounters (1997)<br/><br/>Serendipity: A dude has a magical gate. Doesn't even have an ending SAN reward/failure state, the first time I've seen it! Nothing.<br/><br/>Six Foot Plot: A guy is buried alive and the characters must rescue him. This is a straight mystery with no Cthulhu Mythos in it! Nothing.<br/><br/>Terrible Head: A lady is going crazy because she saw some baby nightgaunts. Nothing.<br/><br/>The Last Of Joy: A lady turns into a Deep One and her husband thinks she just needs a good talking to. There's some very odd railroading in this one. Like...I don't even understand why it's there. The investigators have gone to the guy's house and they can hear weird sounds upstairs and the guy is clearly battered. "An investigator must explain how Wendy cannot be helped unless Jeremy demands she come down now for the meeting."  Really? I'd be kicking the door open and yelling.  The scenario ends with husband confronting her and getting disemboweled, although I think any investigator would see how unhinged he was by the experience and keep him away from her. Railroading.<br/><br/>Lost Property: An evil ghoul stalks an investigator. This one is pretty cool insofar as it's just one relatively minor monster but describes many ways it can be creepy to a PC.  Nothing.<br/><br/>Circle of Friends: A bunch of aristocratic morons have a half-baked cult and some weird illegal wine is delivered by mistake to a regular dude. This one is pure lunacy. But no railroading or anything. Nothing.<br/><br/>Ghost Net: A monstrous parasite arrives on earth in a meteor. This one has some weird railroading in it too - this crazy woman thinks the world will be destroyed by a giant meteor/monster in a few hours and she sets off in a plane to the point of impact so she can be killed first/quickly. Welp, the investigators are kind of supposed to go with her. This is not a trip I would go on.  You can't proceed in the encounter without doing it. Railroading.<br/><br/>Painted In A Corner: A crazy artist accidentally summoned monsters through drugs and painting. That is the Lovecraftiest premise of all. Anyway, it's location based - other than the investigators getting their shit wrecked by the monsters when they arrive, there's no particular order to do things and actually there's a significant chance of doing some damage to the monsters through various siege defense tactics. Nothing.<br/><br/>Where Satan Fell: It's a really gross but totally normal rural situation. Basically the investigators stumble into the 1920s game farm equivalent of a modern pig farm's waste disposal system.  Kind of awesome. Nothing.<br/><br/>Mouth Breathers: A haunted road is targeted by Deep Ones. This one's cool because it's integrated into the responses of the non-crazy villagers. Neat, with many ways of handling it, including biological warfare! Nothing.<br/><br/>Horror Man: This is a five part thing. I'll be honest, it's got some continuity problems. At first the authorities ain't doing shit and then the PCs turn around and there's a task force of some kind?!  Heck, it could USE some more railroading. But it don't have any.

I can take a look at Dreamlands, if you want.<br/><br/><b>Tales of the Miskatonic Valley</b> (1991)<br/><br/><b>Freak Show:</b><br/>The investigators discover a baby Deep One at a carnval. The carnies want to make money, the Deep Ones want their spawn back. There's not much in the way of investigating per se, but there are various NPCs with knowledge and motivations spelled out. The adventure takes place over three days, and there are set events that occur on each day, but not necessarily set outcomes -- it depends on what the PCs do and how they get involved. Nothing.<br/><br/><b>Regiment of Dread:</b><br/>An old man is haunted by his experiences in the Civil War. This one also has a timeline of set supernatural events, including a climax which the PCs are forced to witness/participate in if they stick around past a certain point. The adventure says it is "essential" that they do so, and frankly it's kind of boring of they miss it? How mch info they gather before then is up to them, none of it's completely essential, and how they react at the end sort-of determines the ending. BUT, you basically get railroaded to the setpiece ending here unless you check out of the adventure early and refuse to go back.<br/><br/><b>A Painted Smile:</b><br/>An old lady gets a hate-on for the investigators and supernaturally harrasses them. This one is a series of events that happen to the investigators while they dig up clues. It kind a looks like if the PCs don't solve the mystery, it's possible for the Keeper to run out of material? Nothing.<br/><br/><b>The Watcher in the Valley:</b><br/>The investigators go check out an archaeological dig and bad stuff happens. This one has a bunch of NPCs and a loose timeline of events. Basically the evil stuff has a goal and a set of tactics and the Keeper uses these to create scenes where horror happens. This one is clean. Nothing.<br/><br/><b>Fade to Gray:</b><br/>The investigators go looking for some missing teenagers and find a supernatural villain. This is the only one in the book that I never ran, but I wish I had because it is my favourite here. There is a bunch of NPCs, some investigating to get information, and then a series of events as the villain tries to attack them supernaturally (spoilers: they are sort-of set-pieces, but they are dreams sent by villain as attacks). These come with instructions but are left to the Keeper's discretion, so this one is also clean. Nothing.<br/><br/><b>Trail of Yig:</b><br/>The investigators attend a seance and shit goes wrong, finally leading them to a horror hole in the middle of nowhere. This one looks pretty easy for inexperienced players to screw up because there are only a few clues that lead to the end and they are easy to miss if you aren't used to reading things you're normally not supposed to. Also there is only one way to get the clue that totally tharts the evil. Verdict is: not enough clues, but not a railroad, because if you get the clues it's possible to skip right to the end. Chokepoint.<br/><br/>One thing about these is that they almost all use timelines, either strict ones with set dates that events happen on, or flexible timelines of NPC behaviours, to dictate pace and flow, but only in one case are the PCs forced to abide by it if they have other plans. Presentation-wise, this structure could definitely benefit from some of the more recent developments in organization, like what is seen in Dungeon World, but content-wise I remember this method being pretty solid.<br/><br/>Also, a couple of these have no Cthulhu Mythos stuff in them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400756/#Comment_400756" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T21:36:53+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  9:36PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I definitely like the non-Mythos scenarios.<br/><br/>Let's talk about Dreamlands some more. I really have a bit of ambivalence about blaming Dreamlands adventures for railroading, based on the source material. Someone tell me why I'm wrong.<br/><br/>Unseen Masters (2001)<br/><br/>The Wild Hunt: Tindalosian DRUUUUUUGS. The investigators dig into a bunch of mysterious occult slayings. DRUUUGS. There's some great (hilarious) red herrings in this one too ("Listen to my theory, IT'S VAMPIRES"). Actually it is a really thorough modern forensic-investigation-action thriller.  Nothing.<br/><br/>The Truth Shall Set You Free: An investigator who has Seen Too Much descends into schizophrenia, weirdly meshing childhood memories of comic books and TV with reality. As much as I adore this scenario and as powerful and affecting as it was the one time I ran it for someone, I have to say, this is one very, very long railroad, though interestingly you only railroad one of the player characters!  This scenario really deserves more attention. It's amazing.<br/><br/>Coming Of Age: An evil child causes havoc at a summer camp. It's kind of amazing to see a game about insanity turn towards child psychology for a second.  Anyway, it's a location, an artifact, and a monstrous set of plans.

The PCs get roofied and wind up there so a friend can say goodbye to them because he's committing suicide to live in dreams forever. So you just go through the Gates of Slumber to a place and see some things.<br/><br/>In <b>Lemon Sails</b>, a dude ask the PCs to accompany him to his homeland, on another planet. If they say yes, they go there and see what has happened to it. It's sort-of a railroad, but you can choose not to get on, and really you can turn the train (which is technically a ship that sails through space) around if you want to be a dick to this guy you befriended.<br/><br/><b>Land of Lost Dreams</b>, the piece de resistance of the book, is also sort-of a railroad? The PCs want to help out their buddy who's in the hospital, so they check his stuff and it turns out he went to place in the dreamlands. So they go and get on a ship and it's a travelogue until they get there. Once they get there, the adventure turns into the most harrowing series of near-arbitrary death-traps that I have actually never run this one due to the fear that no investigators would actually survive to see the end unless I fudges die rolls. The actual content is really interesting, but the die rolls are fucked.<br/><br/>So, "travelogue railroads." A lot like the Pits of Bendal-Dolum, above, actually.<br/><br/>The other three are longer and I don't remember all the specific details, but I'll give them a quick read later. One of them has wandering monster checks, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400760/#Comment_400760" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T22:12:09+00:00" title="December 13, 2012 10:12PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fuckin' hell, Jason, looking at these old adventures really makes me want to run some of them again.

As noted in this thread and others, it's not universal, but it's consistent over games and over time. As noted in the Vampire 1ed thread, it even persisted in modules written for games whose primary textual instruction to its audience was "don't railroad!" <br/><br/>And to a degree, it's not even "story" that creates the railroad.  With the CoC modules we've analyzed, it's really just pacing, as others have noted really cogently in the thread.  And if you think about what stories are, it makes perfect sense that railroading would not really be connected to them, because stories are, primarily, character decisions and consequences.  <br/><br/>Modules tend to railroad to <i>get the players to as much content as possible</i>.  Video games do this too (although after Spec Ops: The Line, I expect many, many game companies to re-evaluate this, at least in games with a narrative.)  You go to this dungeon because that's what's prepared. You seek out the magical dingus because that's where the adventure is.  It's not really a "story" railroad in the sense that you make key decisions for the players. All the key decisions in your typical Dragonlance railroad were in the hands of the players - spells and attacks and movement and exploration and so on - but the players must be delivered to those decisions for them to make them.  <br/><br/>There are some exceptions. The really early Champions module I have is definitely railroading to preserve comic book reality, for example. But overall I think that modules-that-railroad are definitely a thing, and not even a thing that closely related to story. I think it's just related to the concept of "you bought this, you're gonna want to use as much of it as possible."<br/><br/>Anyway, that's just my theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400830/#Comment_400830" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T10:57:57+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 10:57AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think some of the railroading and magicians force comes from trying to transport a certain mood or feeling that needs pacing. Like tension or fear. So the increase of pressure often is accomplished by giving only one order of scenes and certain things that have to happen. The technology to scare players in the way the author intended is rather hard to find and railroading is one approach to solve the problem. So part of the problem is genre based.<br/>The other part of course is to create a scenario that has to be the same in some ways, creating an experience players can relate to each other after. Which sure is a goal in module writing, even if different actions in the game should matter of course. But it is a point where railroading can come in again. So that every player who played "that one adventure" remembers "that one cool scene".<br/>Also published campaigns that need plot points to have happened to work can lead to railroading, just so that the writers can assume certain things in the next installment of the series.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400857/#Comment_400857" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T13:27:21+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  1:27PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2012 1:27PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To put what I said another (shorter, better?) way, my perception is that over time, and across many games, modules have railroaded, so their creators probably did so for many different reasons, since they did it in many different contexts, but modules are one place you can consistently find railroading no matter when or where you start looking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400859/#Comment_400859" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T13:40:03+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  1:40PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is hard to find written railroading outside of modules.

People started to come to games expecting some kind of story progress built in more than just a bash 'em up, even in bash 'em up games.<br/><br/>Modules for TSR's Indiana Jones Game and FASERIP Marvel make CoCmodules look like sandboxes almost no matter what.<br/><br/>I wonder though if some of the frustration with this kind of stuff does come from the fact that most people start with sandboxish D&amp;D as their early experience, or did for a couple decades anyway.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400923/#Comment_400923" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-15T05:51:32+00:00" title="December 15, 2012  5:51AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I wonder though if some of the frustration with this kind of stuff does come from the fact that most people start with sandboxish D&amp;D as their early experience, or did for a couple decades anyway.<br/></blockquote>\nI think the feeling of freedom is there in the beginning of most role playing careers and a big draw of these kinds of games. You can basically do whatever you want with your character and the rules just tell you how big your chances are at suceeding. Be it wandering around in a Dungeon Sandbox in D&amp;D, shooting up Gangs in Shadowrun or hunting whoever looks tasty in Vampire. There is the promise of being able to do what you imagine. But you also want to tell stories, there is a whole chapter about that in the book after all and they are publishing stories you can live. <br/>The new GM also wants to do what he or she imagines though and often those are stories and some of them turn to railroading for lack of technology and experience. But how else to make the players life the story as it is supposed to go?<br/>It makes sense how beginners might feel betrayed about getting railroaded and hating it. But it also makes sense how a new GM might turn to railroading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400958/#Comment_400958" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T08:49:27+00:00" title="December 16, 2012  8:49AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2012 8:56AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back to work!<br/><br/>I found some more Unspeakable Oath. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a>, Fall 1993:<br/><br/>Hey, anyone know anything about Ragnarok from Austin, Texas?

This is a cool adventure, very stylish and creepy. Nothing.<br/><br/>In Media Res (by the thread's own John Tynes!): There is a (tiny) bit of railroading in this classic. There's a location that the characters can semi-easily leave if they want to. This ends their involvement in the module. There's some advice on keeping this from happening in various ways. It's just a smidge but since we're looking for it like 16th century witch hunters, I'm gonna put it in the railroading category. Edit: I should note that I've run this one 3-4 times and never had to do anything to keep the characters in the location. The setup is just too ludicrous/insane/wonderful for anyone to want to check out for any reason. But if they want to, the module says you should try to dissuade them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400959/#Comment_400959" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T08:54:31+00:00" title="December 16, 2012  8:54AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Escape From Innsmouth (1992) - This is my favorite campaign for CoC.

We've been (correctly I think) distinguishing railroading from "choosing to play the module", so if a guy comes to the investigators and says "my wife is going crazy plz help" or the GM says "your cousin norbert sends you a frantic telegram" we have not been really looking at the PCs saying "nope lol u on yr own bro", because we (again correctly) see that as just choosing not to play the module.<br/><br/>That said, there are a lot of very cool modules with ENORMOUS setups - "you've all been having this shared terrible dream of this dark obelisk and Dr. Crosby, a hypnotist and therapist has been helping you all in group and individual sessions". "uh okay?!"  So there's sometimes when a player thinks that the setup time is over and they can start really playing, but it's not over yet, there's still some things that have to happen or the module doesn't. This can be tough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager"

I don't know that this in itself guarantees a scenario is not a railroad, but it helps. Anyway, the PCs are told, "Okay, find out what's gone wrong on an oil platform, deal with it, and keep the Deep Ones from getting pissed and destroying us all." I am taking it as read that if the players aren't buying in enough to go to the oil platform, then there's a bigger problem than some railroading going on.<br/><br/>Once at the platform, the PCs have a number of trained NPCs willing to take instructions. Lots of freedom for the players. Communications with superiors are cut off, at least for a time, but... if this is railroading, it's a kind I can live with. At this stage, one could have a TPK. One could theoretically set off events that would lead to the Deep Ones destroying Britain. Either of these means the group probably doesn't get to the rest of the scenario, so there's freedom to screw things up so badly that the scenario ends early.<br/><br/>The next part -- well, if "Okay, you now know the rest of the problem is over here, and that's where you have to go now" is a railroad, then there's railroading. I don't know if you consider this railroading, linear plotting, or just part of the scenario. The new location is likely to lead back to the old, short of a TPK, which is unlikely, but possible. At the old, the PCs may know enough to salvage the situation, may have been tricked into making things worse, or may have chosen to throw their lot in with the villain, which will make things worse. There are a couple of variations on these basic options, but that's what it boils down to.<br/><br/>The second scenario is the one I'm finishing now. It has a double set up -- that it, it opens with the PCs being told, "Your job is to do X" where X is a false beginning, a comic scene, leading to the <i>real</i> mission -- although the false beginning does have a couple of things that are probably clues-in-retrospect.<br/><br/>The PCs' actual job is to find a laptop than an NPC left behind in a cab. Again, I am assuming that refusing to do that is a sign of deeper problems than railroading. There are a lot of options detailed here, enough that I'm comfortable that the author figures that if the PCs come up with something unexpected, the Keeper should be able to roll with it.<br/><br/>That's as far as I've gotten. I'm not yet sure whether tracking down the laptop is linear or railroaded, but so far, I am pleased with the scenario. I do note that certain minor bits of railroading-for-comedy are acceptable to me in the Laundry scenarios if this is done for the purpose of recreating a bit of the tone of the books.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401202/#Comment_401202" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-18T17:34:18+00:00" title="December 18, 2012  5:34PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2012 5:36PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, discovering that there's more clues/info in another location can't really be considered railroading.

Up to here, I'm good. There's an amusing complication tossed in, and I'm grinning at that. At the appropriate time, NPC X shows up.<br/><br/>Now, NPC X and NPC Y are both villains. X is betraying Y, and decides to use the PCs. This means that X will make absolutely sure that the PCs put together the clues to learn of Y's villainy -- still fine. In fact, glorious -- there is an actual Reason for the NPC to walk the PCs through the clues.<br/><br/>But, at this point, the author makes some odd assumptions:<br/><br/>1. The PCs will believe or at least act like they believe X completely. Sure, Keepers are told to play X as always a step ahead of the PCs. You tell me if you feel that you're always a step ahead of your players and their PCs. I don't.<br/><br/>2. They will go to where Y is without attempting to deal with X, and X will follow them, and they will have No Chance of spotting X. Okay, X is invisibly following them, but at this point, the PCs may well know enough to know that's a factor, and, last I checked, "invisible" does not mean "inaudible".<br/><br/>3. Okay, they are now at the building where Y is, and there's a comedic bit I love where a zombie can't make a phone call until someone takes off the "Do Not Use" post it from the phone. Or, you know, makes the call herself. But, why is the author assuming that the PCs are going to want to call Y from the reception desk of his building? I give it at least even odds that the PCs will walk past the zombie and head straight for Y's office. I see nothing to indicate that this won't work.<br/><br/>4. The PCs will then have the conversation with Y -- on the phone -- in such a way that Y will know that the gig is up. Y will then push the button to lock himself in his office and have security procedures target the PCs. And, again, we are presuming that the PCs aren't in the office to begin with.<br/><br/>5. The PCs can't be in the office so that Y can try a different plan, as Y is actually smart enough to figure that the anti-intruder measures will merely slow the PCs down. So, there MUST BE this scene of Y using this different plan. Er, why?<br/><br/>6. Once the PCs have dealt with Y, assuming Y is still alive, X will kill Y, No Matter What. Granted, X is invisible, and if the PCs have actually followed the script the author expects, they're not likely expecting invisible assassins -- but they might not be following that script. Also, I'd expect some consideration of a couple of basic tactics one could use against invisible enemies. It's lovely to know there's a make-the-invisible-person-visible device nearby, if the PCs recognize it for what it is, but I'm thinking about stuff like tossing buckets of water or rugs over invisible people.<br/><br/>7. Oh, and what's at stake here is the job of the PCs' boss. What if the PCs decide that they're okay with the boss going down and back either X or Y? Heck, I'd expect the PCs to at least pretend to do so when they're dealing with Y, either on the phone or in Y's office.<br/><br/>8. And, even if the PCs screw up, their boss will only temporarily lose some pull. In other words, the PCs do not truly have the ability to lose.<br/><br/>There's a side issue as well. I sometimes wonder how carefully the author has calibrated opposition. It seems to me that there's a reasonable chance that one or more or maybe even all of the PCs will wind up dead in the scenario as she is write. Is this the author's intent?<br/><br/>This is far from the worse scenario I've hit. It just happened to be right to hand. I can easily fix it -- but I don't consider that an excuse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mytholder" title="mytholder"><img alt="mytholder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mytholder">mytholder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401323/#Comment_401323" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T11:12:27+00:00" title="December 20, 2012 11:12AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Author weighing in for clarification.<br/>1 is a fair comment. Having the villain of the piece interact directly with the PCs is always risky. <br/>2... well, there isn't much "dealing with X to do." At this point in the scenario, there isn't that much evidence pointing to X as the villain - she just looks like a minor flunky who points the way to the next scene. As for following the characters, she can do that at a distance. <br/>Any prewritten investigative scenario is going to have sections where the writer assumes the most likely course of events happens (in this case, that the PCs follow X's suggestion to go after her boss). Otherwise, you end up with either absurd levels of if-thens...<br/>3. They can't phone Y directly from their cellphones (see page 35), but the zombie's desk phone is a direct line to Y's desk phone (and they don't have this number). They can just grab the phone themselves. (The zombie won't let them walk past without permission from Y.)<br/>If they do head to the office without talking to Y, then he can spot them on the security cameras and activate the defences then.<br/>4 &amp; 5 both assume that Y doesn't activate his security measures, which he does. (Or, at least, is extremely likely to do so in most reasonable playthroughs. I didn't account for the possibility that the PCs might, say, set the building on fire or something like that.)<br/>6. I suppose I could have said "X TRIES to kill Y", or "if present, X tries to kill Y" instead of X kills Y. And yeah, advice on fighting invisible foes would have made a nice sidebar (although how many offices have buckets of water or rugs handy?)<br/>7. I made the assumption that the PCs are at least nominally loyal to their boss in general. In this specific case, the boss is explicitly stated to be James Angleton, who's a major character in the Laundry novels. Screwing over Angleton is like a Rebellion character in a Star Wars game handing Obi-Wan over to the dark side. Not unthinkable, but extremely unlikely. If they try bluffing Y - well, if they try bluffing him from the zombie's phone, he's got little reason to believe them. If they try it later on when he thinks he's got the upper hand, then it might work - and then X can shoot him. <br/>8. Well, the PCs might end up dead, which would count as a loss.<br/><br/>PC death is certainly a possibility. It didn't happen in playtest, and I think a total party kill is extremely unlikely unless the GM is being vindictive. Other than her invisibility, Renne isn't a staggeringly tough foe. <br/><br/>More generally, the Laundry Files rpg assumes that the characters are career officers in the civil service. It's their job to go on missions for their superiors, and they're obliged to carry out those missions with a modicum of concern for the law, secrecy and sanity, while also keeping unnecessary expenses and collateral damage to a minimum. I've tried to avoid any situations where the players are forced along an unlikely or undesirable course of action for no good reason, and to provide multiple options where possible. <br/><br/>I also wonder if there's a tension between the quasi-narrative style of writing used for the adventures in Black Bag Jobs, and the perception of railroading. Let's take point 6.\n<blockquote>There's a gunshot, and Y' head jerks back. He collapses to the floor, blood gushing from the neat hole that just got punched in his forehead. <br/><br/>'God, that was satisfying' says a disembodied voice. 'I was just going to frame him with that missing CD, but shooting him in the face...I think I need a cigarette.'<br/><br/>It's X, or at least X's voice. You can't see her.<br/></blockquote>\nI could equally have written that as:\n<blockquote><br/>At a suitable juncture, X shoots Y at point-blank range, killing him. Her original intent was to frame Y using the CD from the laptop, but now she can kill him and blame it on the PCs<br/></blockquote>\nor go even more abstract, say by listing the NPCs, their goals, and possible ways for them to accomplish these goals. Those approaches might seem less like railroading, but would be (to my mind) less fun to read, and less useful to the assumed target audience (a busy GM who wants the scenario to do as much work as possible for them.)<br/><br/>I hope I'm not coming across as defensive here - it's certainly not my intent. I really appreciate this level of scrutiny of my adventures!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401475/#Comment_401475" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-21T15:13:00+00:00" title="December 21, 2012  3:13PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's the only adventure in Black Bag Jobs where I started pulling my hair. I mean, we've got, let's see...<br/><br/>1. Lambent Witch. My only complaint is that the map could have been clearer, especially when I tried to follow it with the text about what was going on that the PCs would have liked to know about. But, other than that -- have some troops! Have some equipment! The fate of Britain is in your hands, really, no fooling! What's not to love? (Also, given the contemporary setting, it lacks the usual weasel classic CoC scenarios have about "if they fail, that's why the world is the way it is, and if they succeed, well, the world would've been so much worse if they'd failed".)<br/><br/>2. Lost and Found. As written, No Matter What, Angelton's job really isn't at stake. It says that at worst, he'll take some temporary fallout. Right there, that's a big problem -- it means the PCs can't really fail. Contrast this to Secret Agendas, which does it right. And remember, the first part is set up such that the PCs, if they are on the ball, will know, before they find the cab, they're dealing with someone who can be invisible. If they're amazingly on the ball, they'll have an idea of whom. This is good -- and the follow up is "Well, but, it's not like they're going to be suspicious of the NPC, and anyway, just fiat her actions." Yuck, seriously yuck. And I don't care how you write fiat killing an NPC. It's still fiat killing, nope, nothing the PCs could do, Despite All Your Precautions. Yawn. Why am I playing again? To witness the brilliant plot? Please, just write the story if you've already decided what Has To Happen. As for the loyalty issue, despite appearances, loyalty to the Laundry is not synonymous with Loyalty to Angleton or to whomever is in the Angelton role. Players often find the NPCs you're sure are wonderful to be really annoying, and vice versa. I could see a group deciding, "Well, if he dropped the ball on this, you know, he is losing it." (I am assuming the PCs don't start by magically knowing everything Bob in the books knows.) As for the security measures, it reads like the guy doesn't lock down his office until the PCs call him. I am thinking of an awful lot of players who wouldn't bother calling ahead.<br/><br/>3. Shadow Over Kafiristan. This could totally be CoC or Trail of Cthulhu. The point isn't to solve the mystery, but to decide what to do with one's knowledge. I'm good with this. It means that it's railroaded in so far as the PCs <b>will</b> get all the clues, but this just doesn't bother me. It does bother me that Keepers are told that the PCs must come away feeling soiled, not heroic. Sure, I love the Laundry take on the news -- always assuming the PCs do make it out alive, which isn't guaranteed -- but if the PCs can somehow find a way to carry the day, ethics-wise, or even to stick to their guns in their report, even knowing that the Laundry may still disregard their advice, I'm okay with players and PCs feeling like they pulled as much of a win as they could.<br/><br/>4. The Wild Hunt. PCs sent to a place to check it out. Okay, that's the set up, not railroading. Problems ensue. Well, yes, otherwise we wouldn't have an adventure. One thing I think was overlooked: The PCs' cellphones are likely to be Laundry issue, correct? If so, they have a good case for saying they can't hand them over. Mind, this isn't a huge issue, as the scenario doesn't assume they will hand them over. I also would like some idea of what would happen if the PCs, oh, decided to return to London, or to visit Paris or New York City. I don't know how likely this is -- it's a possible course of action, but not so obvious I'd expect my home group to go for it.<br/><br/>5. Secret Agendas. I love this one to pieces. It's everything Lost and Found isn't. The PCs have to figure out which of three people is to blame for an information leak. Set up, hence not railroad. Things get complicated. Also, the three suspects can't lie to the PCs, which is something I really like. The situation is complicated enough without having to worry about blowing the "fail to realize NPC is lying" roll. The stakes are high. The one thing I think could be improved is that the PCs could be made more aware of what's at stake in terms of the future direction of the Laundry, and just what they can do about it. I think as written, it's a bit too subtle. Secret Agendas is a little like Shadow Over Kafiristan in that it's "what do you do with what you learned?", but very different in feel. And it pulls out all the stops.<br/><br/>6. The Signal. This is almost two scenarios in one, except that the first is the foreshadowing of the second. That's fine -- it plays like a good Laundry scenario. PCs are told "There's a problem here" and need to fix it. There's a few ways they can find out what's going on, and a couple of ways they can drop the ball. Hm, I note the concept of "railroading" gets interesting when the premise is "you're a group of people who follow orders". The second part is more complicated. It's kind of a combination of Lambent Witch and Kafiristan, in that there are a lot of resources available, what's going on will almost certainly be revealed, and the question becomes, "Okay, what do you do about it?"<br/><br/>So, five scenarios I consider basically solid, and one that makes me scream. It's not a bad record, actually. And Lost and Found might well work out as envisioned most of the time -- it's just that it wouldn't take much to make it better written for the rest of the time, when a player says, "Wait a minute..." (I had more of a problem with bits of the Zalozhniy Quartet, but that's another story.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401624/#Comment_401624" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-23T19:41:21+00:00" title="December 23, 2012  7:41PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Railroading question: Is this <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3362532/Monster%20of%20the%20Week%20-%20Secret%20Santa%20mystery.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3362532/Monster of the Week - Secret Santa mystery.pdf</a> a railroad or not?

I don't think anyone still reading this is reading it for anything but CoC-chat.<br/><br/>Here we go with some more!<br/><br/>Secrets of Morocco (2008). Despite this being an amazing setting idea, there isn't much in the way of social/political/religious realities/issues presented.  ANYWAY.  <br/><br/>Tablets of Ur-Nansha: An evil sorcerer is going to summon a monstar. There's time pressure but no particular order for anything. Nothing.  <br/><br/>The Ocean of Sand: A lost city and Atlantean technology. Straight up pulp. Nothing. However, this is the first time I ever saw a scenario explicitly say "if you make 1 Library Use roll you get this, if you get 2 you also get this, if you get 3, you also get this".  Basically it assumes when someone goes to the library everyone goes to the library. Interesting. I'm not sure the percentages really work out here. Anyway, none of the normal problems.<br/><br/>Secrets of San Francisco (2006)<br/><br/>The Ferry Ride: MONSTARS AT SEA. This one is actually kind of weird. It's supposed to be an "introductory scenario", but there's really no reason to get involved in the situation and there's no clear consequences if the characters do nothing. If they decide to get involved, it's basically just a location. There are some weird dead ends in it too for an introductory scenario (you can easily get a TPK with normal play).  I'm having a hard time classifying it but I'm going to lean into it a little and say "chokepoint."<br/><br/>The Westchester House: This is a straight up mystery, no Cthulhu shit is actually happening. It can be hard if you don't make a couple of key Spot Hidden rolls, but you could also follow people you suspect to find out where the hidden stuff is? I don't know, it seemed unlikely.  I'm gonna go with Chokepoint.<br/><br/>The Colour Of His Eyes: YES, a GOOD Colour out of Space scenario. I love the Colour Out Of Space.  There are many ways into this scenario and how the investigators get involved dramatically changes how the scenario goes. I really like this.  It emphasizes reacting to the characters actions. Nothing bad here.<br/><br/>Beyond The Edges: It's got one big railroad moment that's somewhat spread out through the scenario - no matter how quickly the investigators figure out what's going on, and no matter what precautions they undertake, they're going to be infected by an alien disease that's spreading through the city and takes them into a strange and horrific land. It's a cool scenario but I gotta call it Railroading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401890/#Comment_401890" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T21:57:21+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  9:57PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Lisa, I think if we're going to get that far astray from Call of Cthulhu it might make more sense for you to talk about the question/subject in depth in a new thread.

I actually think the ending of Eyes is a bit <i>deus ex machina</i>, but the problem was that Chaosium wanted to publish the scenarios as a pair, and therefore needed some kind of guarantee that the sequel would actually be possible, as opposed to Southern England being completely destroyed or something. Originally, I just improvised the first scenario from a page of notes, and then when the players brought things to a fairly successful conclusion, concocted the second based on not much more. But publishing is something else, so I bowed to commercial realities and let Lynn Willis add the Earth Mother figure in at the end. Not quite how I would have done it, but I didn't have any better ideas at the time.  <br/><br/>The cartoon-book dastardly gypsies with their faux-Eastern European names are a bit of an embarrassment to me these days, but so it goes. I think the gypsies in the 2nd edn Gaslight scenario (not mine) are treated more realistically and sympathetically. It helps a lot to have the internet for research, which in 1991 or something, I didn't. Glad you like the book anyway.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402162/#Comment_402162" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-30T08:54:36+00:00" title="December 30, 2012  8:54AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't think it was any more deus ex machina than the source material.

It's hard to be sure whether there's a railroad sometimes, especially if the Keeper is good. Ditto for Magician's Choice.<br/><br/>Two weaker-but-still-acceptable games I've been in had set ups that could have been better, but once one got past that, the rest of the adventure was decent.<br/><br/>One, which I played in years ago, had an obvious "You have to leave the NPC all alone in his hotel room so he can be murdered" bit. This was annoying because the PCs and this NPC were a group of investigators who were aware of the Mythos and knew that they had enemies. Did it destroy the rest of the adventure? No. But, it did mean I cared that much less. If you've got to do this, start with the PCs discovering their friend's body, okay?<br/><br/>Another involved checking out a mine. The big question: Could it open the next day, Monday? If not... a lot of people, including the PCs, would lose their jobs. And none of the PCs knew from Mythos. So far, so cool.<br/><br/>And the checking out the mine part was fine. Well, okay, it was an utter disaster, death and destruction and explosions, and the survivors carefully agreeing on the story they'd tell -- in other words, good Cthulhu fun. It was a bit in the middle that I had a problem with, and it was a bit that didn't need to be a problem.<br/><br/>So, we all knew that there might be a killer loose in the area. Okay, not a problem. We're just going down into a mine. And we all went down, and went to the room with all the equipment, including the explosives.<br/><br/>Or not. The explosives were gone. All of them. And there had been a lot of explosives.<br/><br/>Now, at this point, I and one other player thought that the sensible thing to do was to go back to the surface, make one little cell phone call to the police to say, "Okay, we're checking out the mine, but just so you know, someone has stolen a fuckload of explosives." I mean, Missing Explosives + Possible Killer = Alert the Authorities -- and then, go right back into the adventure. You understand, we weren't trying to stop the adventure.<br/><br/>But, we were informed that this wasn't possible. The other guy and I exchanged a look, told the Keeper that, for the record, this hurt our suspension of disbelief, and then went back to the game, as we didn't want to break the game.<br/><br/>Again, in both cases, the railroad bit was absolutely disconnected from what made the scenario tick.<br/><br/>I remember the names of some of the better convention runs I played in.<br/><br/>I played "Lockdown" at Origins a few years back. The PCs are guards and inmates of a prison, along with an interview crew and some administrative staff. Things go south. For us, they went very, very south. At the end of the game, one player said, "So, was there any way we could have won?" The Keeper told us how we could have not wound up south of Antarctica, and there was a palpable sense of "Okay, that's all right, then." No, we didn't do any of those things. I'm not sure it would have occurred to us to do them. But, it might have, and it was fair.<br/><br/>This GenCon, I played in "Hysteria". "Hysteria" is set in the late 19th century. All of the PCs are women who were institutionalized, which, right there, is plenty horrific. There's an odd tension in this one, because the more you play your characters as writ, rather than as Investigators, the less likely you are to figure out what's going on and deal correctly with it. But, again, there were several things we could have done, or to quote the Keeper, "There were actually a lot of people you might have talked to if you hadn't decided to attack them instead."<br/><br/>"Hysteria" has a bit of railroading in that the PCs are patients at a mental institution, and there's a build up of the daily routine. But, even there, there's a lot of acting out the PCs can do, if they chose -- I had a skill called "Instigate", and I had fun using that -- and, when it came to plot relevant stuff, it seemed like we had a fair amount of freedom. I can't tell if that was an illusion, and there was a twist that might or might not be considered railroading, depending on your definitions. I consider it part of the setup and part clue.<br/><br/>"The Stars Are Fallen", also a game I played in this GenCon, felt like it gave us pretty near total freedom. The Keeper had used The Apocalypse Machine to create a post-apocalyptic setting, so there were serious constraints when it came to food and water, and weather was an important factor, but I cannot think of any point in the session where it felt like the Keeper was herding us, rather than answering our questions and letting us decide what to do. I think we all expected a TPK, but managed to pull off everyone surviving and accomplishing the goals we set ourselves. Of course, we knew, although the PCs did not, how much trouble they'd gotten themselves into by doing what they did.<br/><br/>Then, there are a couple of odd ones, ones I consider good, and which are intrinsically railroading.<br/><br/>Oscar Rios's "Setting Sun, Rising Tide" is about Japanese soldiers in World War II. They're on an island that's about to get overrun by the Americans when they're offered a way out. At this point, just about anyone who signs up for the game has a pretty good idea, out of character, what's going on. But, in character? At this point, there's an intense group discussion about what to do. What is the honorable thing to do? Is that what your character would do? What happens as a result of that choice?<br/><br/>I'd say this one works because all the railroading I think I'm seeing is aimed at the climax, which involves the PCs choosing what is important to them, knowing only what they know, not what we know. Mind, Oscar himself has said, "I write railroads. Okay, sometimes I write a sandbox and put it on a railroad, but really, I write railroads."<br/><br/>Misty Fourtner's "A Night to Remember" is set on the Titanic. Every single PC was a passenger on that ship. We all knew where the adventure was going. I would not have thought I'd be all that interested in sitting and listening to a description of the Titanic sinking -- and yet, for the last five minutes or so of the game, we all sat in rapt attentiveness as Misty read that description. Heck, part of the draw of the game was finding out why the Titanic sank in the game reality.<br/><br/>But the PCs had agency. The ship was doomed -- had been from the beginning of the adventure. Anything you don't want the PCs messing with should happen offstage before the adventure begins. So, the rest of the diabolical plan could be disrupted, and was -- the PCs were on the ball and worked together well, and we had one brainstorm that saved our bacon. Well, our spiritual bacon, at least. Physically.... all of the women PCs got off the sinking ship and into a lifeboat. All of the men stayed behind and drowned.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402846/#Comment_402846" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-06T17:06:21+00:00" title="January  6, 2013  5:06PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cthulhu Britannica (2009)<br/><br/>Cthulhu Britannica has some scenarios I consider odd and challenging to run, probably because they don't fit the stereotype of a CoC adventure. All of these come with pregenerated PCs, should one wish to use them.<br/><br/>Bad Company is my favorite. It's set in the Gaslight period. The Investigators are hired to find a baronet's younger son, a man seen in company of a disreputable woman. She's basically a Dorian Gray type sorceress, currently holding the man prisoner. But there's no straight trail of A then B then C then D then Climax. All of the key locations, NPCs, and clues are described, and the PCs can pretty much go where they want and do what they want. There are a couple of extra layers here, a minor villain in over his head, and a group hunting the major villain which might be allies or additional complications for the PCs. I don't see railroading or a chokepoint.<br/><br/>Darkness Descending is set in the 1930s and inspired by Eddy C. Bertin's story, "Darkness, My Name Is". I've not read the story as yet. This is one of several CoC scenarios set at an archaeological dig. After all, archaeologists are always digging up things that would be better left hidden, and, in this scenario, they have already dug up two of five statues warding against an Outer God. If the PCs do not figure out what is going on and what to do about it quickly enough, Bad Things will happen. This is probably the most traditional of the scenarios in the book, and it's probably no coincidence that it's set in the 1930s.<br/><br/>Wrong Turn has a near future setting, though I think it would work just as well in the present day. It is a complete railroad, as it's basically a horror movie. One by one, the PCs vanish, to be replaced with simulacra, until only one is left. And then? Well, that's up to the Keeper. It's interesting because it's not the usual CoC scenario, but it's also frustrating to me because of the combination of railroading and "Well, you make up the rest, dude." I'd probably do better as a player in this one than a Keeper. In some ways, it reminds me of "In Medias Res".<br/><br/>King is set in the present day, though that could be adjusted. The PCs wake up in a hospital to discover that they've become experimental subjects of a mad doctor. The PCs must try to escape for anything to happen, and the author acknowledges that they may not succeed in freeing themselves from their restraints the first time, although the scenario comes with pregenerated characters, most of whom have a decent chance. So, there's a chokepoint here. The PCs might decide not to try to escape, in which case, I think the best thing to do is to say outright that there's no adventure if they don't. They might all fail to escape on the first attempt, but they can keep trying until they succeed. Since this is the case, you might want to just let them escape on the first try, saying, "It takes a while, but eventually, you wriggle free of your restraints." This also helps circumvent a situation where some PCs escape and decide not to free the others. The sequence isn't what I consider ideal, but okay, let's say that the scenario doesn't properly begin until the PCs are at large. The goal is to find out what was done to them and to escape. And, if the PCs decide not to escape once they know more, that's acceptable as well. So, heavy railroading / chokepoint at the beginning, then nothing, I'd say.<br/><br/>My Little Sister Wants You to Suffer! is set in the future. The PCs have been given false memories and are actually in a sadistic reality show. The author describes the scenario up front as "linear", but assures readers that this is justified because there is an outside force in the scenario controlling things, not just the Keeper doing it. I think that's a bit disingenuous, as the Keeper is the one choosing and running the scenario. This would be tricky for me to run because it is simultaneouly sandboxy and railroady in ways that do not play to my strengths. As the PCs are herded through various hoops, the Keeper is given several options about what to throw at them, both physically and psychologically. Approach this one with care -- you want to be very sure your group is up for this kind of sadism. I'm not sure I would be, if I were kept in ignorance of the premise. If I knew going in about the mindfuck, I could probably have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>So, out of five scenarios: Nothing, Nothing, Horror Movie Railroad, Chokepoint / Railroady set up with nothing once the plot starts, and Weird Railroad. There's a lot of Matter of Taste here, obviously, and full credit to the authors for stretching and experimenting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402883/#Comment_402883" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T02:17:18+00:00" title="January  7, 2013  2:17AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played My Little Sister at Continuum about 7 years ago (I think) and really enjoyed it.

We have:<br/><br/>1. The Westerfield Incident. Sandbox, not railroad. The PCs can be investigators. Or local vigilantes. Or local law enforcement. Or parapsychologists. There's discussion about how the different groups will be perceived and what resources they have. They're there to find out what's killing people and then to deal with it. No chokepoints I could spot.<br/><br/>2. The Vengeful Dead. Full Disclosure: I played in this one at GenCon in 2011, although we never actually got to the, um, scenario part. (Adam Scott Glancy created PCs that were just so delightfully bent on their own agendas that much havoc ensued.) So, I was surprised to learn that the Keeper decides who's actually the villain. In playtests, the author selected one NPC, and I think stuck to that one consistently.<br/><br/>Premise: The PCs are at a resort in a rather secluded area of the country. Then, Stuff happens. This is really good for PCs that are not Investigators, but are normal folks. A couple of things annoyed me as railroading, although these are not only minor, but also not essential. First, there are about three NPCs who might feature in the next scenario in the book, so Keepers are told that if they intend to run that scenario, these NPCs must not be the villain and must be kept alive. Hmph. My take on that is that you can always invent new NPCs. (More on that when I discuss the next scenario.)<br/><br/>The other issue is more interesting to me. There are certain courses of action that the PCs should not be taking, as these are actions taken by characters who know they are in a horror movie / a Call of Cthulhu game, and the PCs should not know that. The author says that the Keeper can flat out veto these things, and I'm not entirely comfortable with that. I mean, if a player says, "My PC breaks into the office and roots through the filing cabinet", it's one thing to hit the PC with consequences and quite another thing to say, "No, I'm vetoing that because I have decided your PC has no reason to do that." I could and would say, "Why? Remember, your character doesn't have reason to think anything is wrong."<br/><br/>And, I'm fortunate enough to play with people who try their best not to metagame in this way. Heck, our problem is usually that we bend over so far backwards not to use Out of Character information that we're not always sure at what point the PC really should figure something out. But that said, I do feel for the author. What does one do when one has a group of players who insist on their PCs doing things that the PCs almost certainly would not do? Is it all right to railroad / use chokepoints to enforce good roleplaying?<br/><br/>3. The Bitter Venom of the Gods. Okay, this starts with an NPC woman who has broken up with her fiance. There is absolutely no reason she has to be the same NPC as in the previous scenario. There are two other NPCs from that scenario who have skills that might be very useful to the PCs, but there's no reason there can't be other such NPCs around.<br/><br/>That's a fairly minor fix. And "NPC X asks for your help" is premise. But...<br/><br/>So, there's a woman who says, "Hi, I broke up with my fiance, and I don't want to give details. I want you to escort me to his family home so I can pick up my belongings, see him one last time, and tie up loose ends. Only, I don't want you actually coming in with me when his family decides to let only me in." And No Matter What, the PCs can't get in with her and can't dissuade her from her course of action.<br/><br/>Forget Call of Cthulhu metagaming here. You're telling me you're enough afraid to want an escort, and I'm supposed to let you walk in alone. I have a problem with this. I have a problem with "And the PCs will have to do the stupid thing so that there is plot." However, this problem is mitigated (but NOT quashed! We are Not Amused.) because of the rest of the scenario design.<br/><br/>So, your NPC friend isn't coming out. A servant says (paraphrasing for the gist), "Oh, she decided to stay, but thanks you for your concern. Go away now." What do you do about it?<br/><br/>There are a number of options from the cowardly (walk away, in which case, the plot can still find you) to the stupidly brave (break in to rescue her) to the tricky-but-doable (get sufficient outside attention focused on the situation quickly enough), and it's entirely possible to get her out alive quickly. This does not break the scenario in the least.<br/><br/>Whatever the NPC's fate, it is the beginning, not the end of the story. The fiance's family is trying to protect its secrets, and the PCs were with their friend, and so they have become targets. It is Totally Fine to rescue the woman quickly. I really like this.<br/><br/>So, there is railroading. It is annoying, and I do not like it. But, it's not as dire as it might be, and the heart of the scenario is more open. Hm, I think the obvious patch I'd use is to let the PCs come in with the NPC if they are sufficiently forceful. It'll just convince the family even more that the PCs have to go. OTOH, that brings up the problem of showing the PCs a bit much of the house, although I'd try to curtail that. Then again, that might just mean the family tries to deal with the PCs on the spot, much as if they'd broken in to rescue the woman in the first place.<br/><br/>4. Curse of the Screaming Skull. Sandbox, not railroad. The PCs are hired to find out what's going on with a supposedly haunted house. Here, as elsewhere, the author says (paraphrasing) "Don't make the players roll for clues they obviously need to solve the mystery if they're looking in the right places / for the right things." The mystery is tangled enough without that. I don't think there are chokepoints here.<br/><br/>5. An Unsettled Mind. The PCs are law enforcement or coroners' assistants looking into a bizarre accident. No railroading, no chokepoint as far as finding out what's going on. The clues are laid out well, the neighborhood is described, and the PCs have a lot of resources. This adventure is intended for new players, and the Keeper is told to explain / remind them of ways to investigate and things to look for. Dealing with the situation is the tricky part, and the author has only two solutions in mind, both somewhat bleak. Now, I'm good with bleak in Call of Cthulhu, but I would want to be open to the players finding a third alternative if they tried.<br/><br/>So, mostly sandboxes, some constraints in some of the adventures in the type of PCs involved, some railroading that I find annoying, but which one can work around. These are definitely in the "read through more than once and do your prep work" category, as the flow depends on the Keeper being familiar with all of the information and clues. All of these fit the Call of Cthulhu investigation / horror genre, but, as the back cover notes, they're original enough that reading the CoC source material won't give the players any kind of edge. This also means that I can use them for non-CoC games that can take a dollop of mystery horror.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405976/#Comment_405976" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T18:43:18+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  6:43PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa, I've updated the numbers with what you've done, great work...what year is "Bumps in the Night"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405978/#Comment_405978" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T19:01:20+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  7:01PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some more:<br/><br/>Secrets of Japan (2005):<br/><br/>The Hin-no-Mazu Slayings: A monstar is possessing people and KILLING. There's a few little hooks, the investigators are invited onto the case, and then there's a number of directions they can go, like interviewing people, examining physical evidence, etc. Interestingly, instead of a Library Use roll determining how to get rid of the monster, you go to the library and then spend 1d6 hours in a combination of examining library material and talking to people at local shrines. A bit of a departure from the normal rules. But nothing.<br/><br/>Meiro: An evil anime series is causing people to go craaazy. There are three locations in this thing but no particular thing you have to do at each one of them.  Nothing.<br/><br/>The Yonaguni Monuments: This is a very cool location-based game where most of the adventure is figuring out how to get to an underwater archaeological site that a kooky professor is convinced he's located, and doing so before rival researchers do. A lot of the hazards have to do with smugglers and criminals. Pretty great. Nothing.<br/><br/>Sinister Seeds: I'm just going to count this as one because it's basically a list of scenario options, each with a potential consequence of success or failure and a set of twists to incorporate or not.  Nothing.<br/><br/>The Bermuda Triangle (1996)<br/><br/>The Privateer's Diary: A mysterious diary leads investigators to treasure...AND DOOM!!!!!!!!! Nothing.<br/><br/>Mansions of Madness (1990)<br/><br/>As promised in the title, this is 5 location-based scenarios, none of them have anything in them objectionable. Interestingly I think this and the Bermuda Triangle are the only supplement books I have that are  ENTIRELY location based - even the actual books <i>about locations</i> typically have event/timeline scenarios as well as location scenarios.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406069/#Comment_406069" name="Item_183" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-12T18:44:31+00:00" title="February 12, 2013  6:44PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2013 10:45AM by JDCorley.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arkham Unveiled (1990)<br/><br/>A Little Knowledge: RE-ANIMATOR!!!

I'm maybe gonna call this railroading, but only because, ONLY because we're looking for railroading with the finest fucking toothed comb anyone could ever imagine.<br/><br/>The Condemned: This is kind of a cool scenario that actually uses the location aspects of the supplement well - an ancient sorcerer is stalking and killing descendants of those who wronged him. There's a timeline involved, i.e. if the investigators don't interfere the sorcerer goes here on this night and there on the next night.  But I'm gonna say nothing.<br/><br/>Dead of Night: ZOMBIE BEBBIES HAVIN ZOMBIE BEBBIES.

When I ran a heavily modified version of it, the player (it was 1-on-1) immediately IDed him as a bad guy and had no intention of going to his home. So, basically, no adventure. I suppose one could say the player refused the premise, but... it doesn't appear like the premise, as written, and to say, "Okay, you guys _have_ to go to the creepy person's house because otherwise there's no adventure" when the players have all pegged the guy as creepy and don't want to and don't have any real reason to means the premise fails the players, not the other way around.<br/><br/>I am curious to know if other GMs have hit this issue, or if it's just us. If it's just us, then either we have perceptive players or we telegraphed too much.

They use photography from the 20s wherever possible to illustrate and for their monster book they used "evidence" like photo manipulated old drawings and stuff like that instead illustration where someone just draws the monster.<br/>There also are german only Cthulhu magazines and some qualified writers who know how to do research, for the historical aspects of scenarios.

Kind of gross.<br/>The Lurker In The Crypt - This one's interesting because it has that "leisurely pace" that allows it to be dropped into other campaign events.  There are SO many friggin failure points in this one that it's almost badly designed in the <i>other direction</i> from railroading - you can just flop in this one and everyone dies and you never get to find out why.

Nothing.<br/><br/>Nemo Solus Sapit - An evil psychiatrist!!!! This one falls into the 'really elaborate setup' category that is semi-close to railroading.  The finale pushes this one over the edge. Railroading.<br/><br/>This Fire Shall Kill - An evil firefighter?!?  I've run this one a couple of times. Actually it's just a set of locations.  Gonna call it nothing.<br/><br/>The Professionals - Political intrigue.  This one's kind of hard to identify.  The people jerking the investigators chains are very slick.  However, it's expected that at some point the investigators are going to figure it out, and what happens after that is up to them. Hell, they might even end up choosing to help the badguy and never quite know what went wrong.  Yet in the finale, damn near nothing they did really matters. Gonna call it both railroading and magician's force. From a promising setup it's a bad ending.<br/><br/>Fractal Gods - COMPUTERS, amirite? The evil computer program requires 10 megs of free disk space AND VGA graphics?!   I actually quite like this one because it creates a testable ecology of inhuman monsters from another dimension.  To some degree there is a little bit of railroading but it's worked into the ecology of the monsters: those "infected" by the fractal are painfully forced to head towards the "gatherer" fractal. It's kind of cool. I'm gonna call it nothing, you gotta problem with that? Thought not.<br/><br/>Gates of Delirium - A dream traveler goes nutso. This is very open-ended, you can go to many different places on your path to figure out how she got into the situation.
