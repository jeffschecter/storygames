<h1>Agendaless Zilchplay and How It Works For Me</h1><div class="Item ItemDiscussion" id="Discussion_13320">\n<div class="Discussion">\n<div class="Item-Header DiscussionHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta DiscussionMeta">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13320/agendaless-zilchplay-and-how-it-works-for-me" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T07:24:16+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  7:24AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 7:24AM by Grymbok.">edited November 2010</span> </span> <span class="MItem Category"> in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/categories/games-and-gaming">Story Games</a></span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                    So... a quick preamble is probably in order here, since this feels like an odd kind of thread to be starting on Story Games, and I only registered here yesterday, so it's pretty fast to be acting weird.<br/><br/>I'm Grymbok (real name Steve, but happy to answer to Grym or Grymbok too). Been reading Story Games on and off for a while (mainly for the Stuff to Watch threads), and been gaming since 1984. These days I have a weekly game with a group of friends - the weekly game has existed in one form or another for 11 of the last 14 years.<br/><br/>Anyway - I'm not really an indie game guy, but I want my games to be more fun so I hang out in places like this and I like to read RPG theory threads in the hopes of finding things which will make my games better at the table. I pick up what is compatible with my style and interests and leave the other stuff alone, basically.<br/><br/>I registered to post here because of the thread about Right to Dream. I'd always assumed that I must have some kind of Creative Agenda prevalent in my play, and since it wasn't either of the other two it must be that one. Long story short - that thread made me realise that actually my play is primarily agendaless zilchplay, and then Peter BB suggested I post about how I have fun with that. So here we are.<br/><br/>What's harder is to know what to say next. I feel a bit like I've been asked to explain the appeal of Britney Spears to a Martian. It's hard to know what are common frames of reference and what aren't.<br/><br/>Let's start with hiking, since that was the analogy in Gregor's post which was my lightbulb moment. Here's the hiking analogy of CAs:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Hiking: So let's go hiking in the open country. We've never been here, we're exploring. Each step we take reveals a new patch of land, we're going into the unknown. So what's exploration for exploration's sake here? Just running around, each in his own direction, to see if we fall into any holes? Mapping the territory inch by inch, drawing intricate maps? You need to explore<i>something</i>, right? If we're doing "double exploration" we still need an object of our exploration. That's why exploration in itself cannot constitute an agenda, in my eyes. "Exploration Squared" is not an agenda.<br/><br/>So what are we exploring? Our own hiking skills, seeing how far we can go or if we can climb that mountain, testing limits, figuring out which shoes work best for what occasions? Step on Up.<br/>Are we exploring what happens to people like us, stuck together out here? Where will our passions drive us, and how will we act in untenable situations? Story Now.<br/>Are we exploring the world, seeing how it works? Or our role as hikers? Or hiking to affirm our friendship? Right to Dream.</blockquote>\nThis worked for me because my wife and I go hiking sometimes. You know why? Because it's fun, and because we enjoy the sheer exploration of it. We like seeing a nice view, or photographing wildlife. But there's also just something nice about being out in the quiet of the countryside, enjoying the open air. We just plain enjoy hiking for itself.<br/><br/>I'm the same with role-playing. I straight up enjoy the act of role-playing itself. I enjoy getting to inhabit another character for a while (or multiple ones if I'm GMing). To use a shorthand I've used before when talking about this - it's just plain fun pretending to be an Elf. <br/><br/>Now there's a couple of assumptions going on here. We don't sit around once a week having (pretend) elf tea parties, because one of the things about elves (in all their many variations) is that they live exciting lives. But basically that's what we do in our group. We get together, assume our roles, and then storm the castle and save the princess. If we're on form we'll even get a knowing quip to the camera before the credits roll, and then next week we do it all again. And that, for us, is fun. We're definitely not pursuing Story Now - it's pretty classic Story After. Challenges are met by elves, not players, and so it's not Step On Up, generally. And the shared imagined space is generally all made up of cardboard cut-outs that only look convincing from the right angle - there's some degree of Right to Dream in there I'm sure, but no-one in our group has ever stopped a session to complain about lack of genre fidelity (hell, I don't think we've ever conciously tried to emulate a genre, but obviously different systems take us in different directions).<br/><br/>Ultimately, we're just grooving on the basic role-playing. The exploration of character and situation (with a pinch of setting).<br/><br/>Here's an Actual Play side of things. Our current campaign is... well it's really complex. Let's just say it's post-apocalyptic as a shorthand, so some people have tech and others don't. We're in a shanty town outside the walls of a fortress, with a second wall now having sprung up keeping the shanty town safe from the wildlife (dinosaurs, as it happens). Anyway, we want in to the fortress to meet our longer-term goals. Two weeks ago my PC made contact with the local equivalent of the mafia. They say they can help us get in to the fortress, but to prove our worth we had to steal some explosives from one of the guard towers in the shanty town.<br/><br/>So that was our last session. We scouted, we discussed ideas, and we eventually pursued a plan I thought had no chance of success, but sometimes you just have to go with the flow (IC and OOC that one was). So we try to sneak in, it fails (as predicted) but thankfully our point man fell back on my idea of bluffing and that worked out. We then all get in, steal some uniforms, try to avoid the people who should be there, accidentally wake the guard chief, but manage to bluff him out, and then find and rescue two "pleasure women" the guards had kidnapped as well as finding the explosives. Then we snuck out again, and I made sure the women were OK and then released them.<br/><br/>Was that a great session? No, not really, but it was last week's session so it's the one I remember most. Because my play is generally in campaigns I look at it like a TV show. What matters more is whether the series on average is good, rather than whether every single episode is.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's me and my zilchplay, and how I'm happy with it. No idea if I've hit the right beats to explain it - happy to talk more.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300009/#Comment_300009" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T08:12:54+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  8:12AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never been convinced that zilchplay exists in anything more than a momentary phenomena and I'm pretty sure I dont see it in your example.

When we talk about creative agenda we're talking about the social interactions of a group.  If you are playing in the traditional mode with one gm and several players each will have several instances where they have to make choices that get the dream right.  The gm usually is required to create those exciting situations which in your case is not elf tea parties.  The players have to create characters that fit the dream, ones who are suited to those situations you find exciting instead of pc's that would be suited to the tea parties.  Those assumptions continue in play, the character engage with the exciting situations and dont go chasing after a tea party to settle into and the gm works to make the situation exciting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300013/#Comment_300013" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T08:22:36+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  8:22AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 8:24AM by Teataine.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Steve. Thanks for this.<br><br>Just as a disclaimer, I'm no kind of authority on CA and I've got my own take on it, so these conversations are more about getting a feel that to set anything in stone. Anyway...<br><br>I'm of the mind that explicit agenda is not required for play at all, as long as the players are all agreeing and playing together and grooving on one another and stuff. We might call it "zilchplay", but whatever. <br/><br/>To me, Creative Agendas get really useful when the group is not working. When people are suffering with one another and it seems like they're destroying each other's fun. When that happens it's clear that there are different agendas in play and people didn't talk and don't really know what they're doing. If you know what you're doing without having an explicit agenda, awesome.<br/><br/>Creative Agendas don't need to be explicit. People can tend to veer one way in a game, without even ever hearing about "CA". I know this first hand. There were certain disagreements in our group and it was only after I finally "got" CA that I had the words to describe it, to understand what was actually going on. Suddenly, things fell into perspective.<br/><br/>There's another thing: if something doesn't neatly fit the parameters of an agenda, it doesn't mean it's something opposite. If a game is not explicitly Step on Up, there's no reason at all to assume it's Story Now. Vincent Baker also talks about play that's within an agenda, but not living up to its full potential.<br/><br/>Either way, it's not science. It's just a relatively useful way to talk about how other people play. You know, when you meet/hear/read about another person's game and you're like "huh?"...that's where CA can explain stuff.<br/><br/>Ok, on to your post, I'd just like to comment on a couple of things...\n<blockquote>Challenges are met by elves, not players, and so it's not Step On Up, generally.</blockquote>\nBut it's still the players controlling the elves, right? "The elves" are the players' resource to deal with challenges (or whatever in the game). But yes, I think you're right.\n<blockquote>Here's an Actual Play side of things....<br/>So that was our last session.

That plan did indeed fail immediately, but the fall back position of bluffing worked out.<br/><br/>I would say, at our table, the general assumption is that bad luck or bad planning will earn you a setback. So we were at risk of failing to meet our objectives, sure. You need both bad luck and bad planning - or alternatively a display of sheer idiocy - to be at risk of character death.<br/><br/>Generally speaking (I GM a lot for the group and I think our other GM feels the same way), having the group fail/die is OK if they can see it coming or it feels "fair". I'll fudge results if it becomes clear that something's gone wrong in terms of our shared understanding of the scene and that this is what's going to kill people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300023/#Comment_300023" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T08:53:15+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  8:53AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, thanks.

In my mind creative agenda is a type of social contract, not sure if that's entirely cannon but given that it's spoken of as a social phenomena and not really on the individual level it makes sense to me.  Even if it's not and this is just social contract stuff the CA arrow is piercing it bringing that social contract stuff into the game and giving a focus to the types of situations and the ways the players engage with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA recent example I ran into on RPG.net a gm was complaining about a prospective player in a Star Wars game who wanted to be a shady character or a grey Jedi.  Perfectly valid character in the wider world of Star Wars but it wasnt right for this gm's game.  It didnt fit because the gm was looking for a specific experience, a certain dream in big model terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I've formulated it here is pretty basic, it's looking at the big picture not specific instances.  Your own Dream is probably much more complex Elves who like to do exciting things (not tea parties).  It probably includes a certain tone for the game, whether gritty and dark, light and fluffy or an acceptable range in between and many more categories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300026/#Comment_300026" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T09:05:56+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  9:05AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think this is the point where it's useful to draw a distinction between PC goals and shared party goals.<br><br>The party goal is usually going to be something along the lines of "save the village/princess/world". Yes, these are usually met. Again, the social contract for our table is that if the GM is saying "OK the adventure is for you to save the princess", then that should be something we're capable of doing. The expected outcome is success, and if we fail then we've screwed up (plot twists notwithstanding - "the princess is in another castle"). I guess a reasonable analogy would be CSI or another cop show. Most weeks they catch the bad guy, but not always.<br><br>Player goals get less protection. Which I'm sure seems odd to many here. The GM will generally work with the player to offer them a path to get to their goals, but if the player doesn't follow it (for whatever reason) it usually just gets dropped.<br><br>On the topic of obstacles... Well let's do an actual play example. In the first half of the current campaign we were cops on a colony ship leaving Earth. We had general orders (i.e. "stop crime"), but the party goals didn't become apparent until a few sessions in, and indeed it was practically the end of the campaign before it became apparent how the two primary goals we were offered - Stop Morden &amp; Stop Tanya - really played together.<br><br>Anyway, I brought this up to talk about obstacles. Basically these two people were the cause of the main crime problems on the ship. Both could be seen as terrorists with cells behind them. As time went on, their plans progressed, and so the cost of our failure became higher. So - if we'd failed at every stage (or at certain key ones) then we'd have failed the goal completely. But in most cases the obstacles just meant our final victory became more pyrric. I think that's pretty typical for us actually - failed obstacles usually mean success comes at a higher cost.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300032/#Comment_300032" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T09:43:17+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  9:43AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 9:43AM by Teataine.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for taking your time to talk about your play. It's great to "listen in" on other people's games like this. Much appreciated.<br><br>So, if you want to hear my conclusion, here's what I can gather. You don't have an explicit agenda (clearly), but if I had to pin it down I'd say you're playing "soft" Right to Dream. It's not your main thrust or explicit agenda, but I think your group is functioning on enough (un)spoken agreements and assumptions to have certain emergent qualities. The most telling, to me, are the facts that the heroes usually succeed. <br/><br/>"Your goal is to stop crime." is a very Step on Up thing to do, it's basically setting a winning condition. But I'm not really feeling that the challenge of achieving that goal is why you guys play (correct me if I'm wrong), so I'll exclude Step on Up.<br/>The characters have personal goals, but I'm also not seeing you play to put these characters into untenable situations in regards to their goals...so, no passionate characters in untenable situations, escalating to the final resolution, so no Story Now. So, we've determined it's not those things. Can we say it's Right to Dream?<br/><br/>The basic arc of your game is the arc that a story usually takes (failures induce consequences/new, harder situation/ and eventually you get to the resolution). There's one thing. You aren't doing story on purpose or as a goal, but "it's how stories work". You're keeping it "correct".<br/>You also say it's "like CSI", that's very much in the same vein. You know they'll find the murderer (99% of the time) but it's still exciting to watch, right? Likewise, most of your stories end up with the characters getting to the finish line. Player goals get protection, characters get what they want, unless, you know, the player doesn't care.<br/><br/>Those all sound very Right to Dream to me. You're obviously not playing it as an explicit agenda, but I'd say it falls under the same general category. Here's the "proof": <i>During play, you, as a group, are engaged in functional decision-making (on a large scale) based upon empowerment of the PC-hero role and shared assumptions about how stories should go.</i><br/><br/>Tell me if I'm getting this "diagnosis" wrong.<br/><br/>In other words, if instead of saying "Your goal is to stop crime." the GM would tell you "This game is about your characters stopping crime.", he'd be just explicitly stating your unspoken assumptions, yes or no?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300033/#Comment_300033" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T09:47:06+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  9:47AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you have an example of play in this same campaign that was problematic?

This is why I said to Vernon that I felt his definition of Right to Dream was reductionist, since <i>to me</i>, maintaining a shared idea of the fictional world and interacting with it is what you do in an RPG all the time. So it then starts to feel like a fallback mode - if you're not surrently engaged in Step On Up or Story Now, then you must be in Right to Dream.<br/><br/>I may be way off here.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Do you have an example of play in this same campaign that was problematic?

The first one is from the campaign I've been talking about. The backstory was that we were all "assigned" our jobs as cops. We didn't have to have prior experience. I created someone who had though - I wanted to play someone a bit like an old-fashioned copper who knows they're guilty and just wants to get them for something. A guy who was a bit dirty and who might well get dirtier depending on how the campaign went. I often create PCs who are on a bit of a tipping point, which presumably can be seen as a weak kind of Story Now? Anyway.<br/><br/>Problem was, I thought this was going to be a sort of hard-boiled detective game, where we'd know quickly who and where the bad guys were but wouldn't be able to pin it on them. My guy would have rocked in that. But it wasn't - it was a cat and mouse story where the bad guys were as ephemeral as smoke and I felt (IC and OOC) frustrated. I felt like my guy didn't fit the game. So the GM and I spoke about it, and he tried to spin things my way, bring me in to the story more - but ultimately I was a square peg in a round hole in the campaign, and so it didn't work out too well. Things have been better in the current sequel campaign though.<br/><br/>The other example I thought I'd give because (to my mind at least) it's more of a "gimme". It's a clasic CA issue. Different campaign, different GM, and this guy is the closest thing we have to a Gamist in the group. He's the kind who reads the Char Op boards for D&amp;D, and when he got to GM, all the bad guys had read them too, and we kept meeting Spiked Chain Cheesefighters and all kinds of other things. And, well, we hated it. We teased him about it incessently, because, even though we were playing in his own home-brew setting and so there were clearly appropriate for the setting he was describing, they didn't fit our general undertones of what made D&amp;D for us. But I don't think he ever quite got why it bothered the rest of us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300040/#Comment_300040" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T10:06:34+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 10:06AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 10:06AM by Grymbok.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Those all sound very Right to Dream to me.

Anyway.</blockquote> I think this is definitely in the arena of Story Now play - what were your intentions for this character, if play had been more in a vein you were interested in? <br/><br/>Story Now play could come in the form of using play events to run towards choices about your character - situations that give you a chance to push against events of play in ways that matter to you, emotionally and thematically. <br/><br/>I did something like what you're describing here in a game of Exalted - my character was going to approach the plot from a reactive, emotionally engaged perspective, and I was on a tipping point - would I remain loyal to the Death Lords, or would I leave them behind?<br/><br/>I would describe such a thing as "addressing Premise through character". And I should definitely add that one instance of Story Now play does not mean you're "just a Narrativist" or anything - CA does not exist to be connected to player identities or types. It describes a group interaction. What I'm saying is that it's possible to be the only person in the group interested in exploring a particular CA, and finding your at-that-time priorities clashing with those of the group.<br/><br/>For me, I'd say that developing a familiarity with different Agendas means that the type of play one engages in, what kind of priorities one adopts, becomes more about the game you're playing rather than you as an individual. There's a tendency to play in a particular fashion only, when the games one has played are largely of a single type - i.e. all supporting a particular Agenda. There's a sense that one style of play is "correct", because that's what one has encountered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300047/#Comment_300047" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T10:43:05+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 10:43AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've a couple of hunches, but I need a bit more data:<br/><br/>What game system are you using on a mechanical level?

This isn't anything unusual; the theories of Newtonian physics have lots more requirements than anything we're going to see here.<br/><br/>These assumptions and preconditions have been reiterated a number of times; a quick search pulled up <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=27126.msg258544#msg258544" rel="nofollow">this instance</a> but there's nothing particularly special about it (although it does mention zilchplay by name, so that's a slight edge.)  To cut-and-paste the assumptions from there:\n<blockquote>1. You have to trust that the procedures work - look, these instruments make different noises, so we can make music; look, this ball is bouncey, so we can toss and dribble it<br/><br/>2. You have to want to do it, now, here, with these people - important! (a) as opposed to other activities, (b) as opposed to "with anybody who'll let me"<br/><br/>3. You have to try it out, to reflect meaningfully on the results, and to try again - if it's worth doing, it's worth learning to do better; failure is not disaster, improvement is a virtue</blockquote>\nIf those assumptions do not hold for your group and their actual play, then theories like Creative Agenda are less likely to be meaningful or useful.  I'm still not entirely sure whether they do hold for you or not, or which ones, but I'm playing a hunch here.<br/><br/>To get back to the original hiking metaphor, if you're out hiking and you don't particularly care where you're going, or how you get there, or how quickly you get there, or who you're hiking with, or any health benefits that might arise, then a lot of advice about orienteering and topology and physical training is just not going to mean very much to you.  This won't stop people who really care about orienteering or time-trials from informing you that you're hiking totally wrong, of course.<br/><br/>While Ron tends to present these as hard-edged, non-negotiable requirements for any social leisure activity to be fun and/or rewarding, I myself am not convinced, and I think you have the potential here to give us some very valuable data about which assumptions you may have bent, and how.<br/><br/>I'd be indebted to you, then, if you could tell us about how you think these requirements are reflected in your group -- which ones hold, which ones don't, and how the results have still managed to be fun rather than disastrous.  Or if I'm completely out-to-lunch here, that's fine too -- I'm taking a bit of a stab in the dark here and I may well have missed entirely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300123/#Comment_300123" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T14:02:18+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  2:02PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK. Happy to answer, although the questions don't seem particularly illuminating to me, so not sure if I've understood the intent behind them correctly.<br/><br/><b>1. You have to trust that the procedures work - look, these instruments make different noises, so we can make music; look, this ball is bouncey, so we can toss and dribble it</b><br/><br/>We're talking about the game rules here? Yeah, I'd say we make a deliberate attempt to engage with the rules as presented for games we play. As I noted earlier, there's fudging which goes on, which of course is problematic. These days I'm increasingly of the view that if I'm having to fudge results then I'm using the wrong system, so I'm trying to move away from running systems where I've felt that pressure as GM.<br/><br/>Where we probably do worse is engaging with the designer's assumptions about what exactly their game should be used for. Although of course we're Trad gamers and Trad games are not exactly noted for detailed advice in that regard anyway!<br/><br/><b>2. You have to want to do it, now, here, with these people - important! (a) as opposed to other activities, (b) as opposed to "with anybody who'll let me"</b><br/><br/>Yes, absolutely. As noted, we game every week and have done so for years. Only friends of existing members are allowed to join the group - a rule which is even more strictly enforced since the one time we broke it.<br/><br/><b>3. You have to try it out, to reflect meaningfully on the results, and to try again - if it's worth doing, it's worth learning to do better; failure is not disaster, improvement is a virtue</b><br/><br/>Yep. Myself and the other main GM in the group have been chatting post-game and debriefing each other's sessions on a regular basis ever since the group got started. We also have all-group discussions from time to time - generally when it's already apparent something's gone wrong and we need a more wide discussion about how to fix it or whether to just give up on the current game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300134/#Comment_300134" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T14:44:01+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  2:44PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yo, so, since we're going back to roots here for a sec, this would be the least derailing time for me, Noted Contrarian (or just Internet Asshole) to weigh in with a non-GNS look at your Creative Agenda.<br/><br/>Creative Agenda is "all matters of imaginary importance", it's your aesthetic priorities, it's, in short, what you like.  It's entirely based in your taste as a gamer. Some people have very narrow (selective?) tastes, they only like a particular kind of thing happening. Some people are promiscuous and they'll enjoy almost anything that comes along.<br/><br/>So for example, take this discussion of why you didn't like spiked chains:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grymbok</cite><br/>It's the triple dip of them being a) something that wasn't in TSR D&amp;D, b) something that never appears in the fiction that inspires D&amp;D and c) mostly famous purely because of silly optimisation tactics that pick up purely on the rules properties of the weapon.</blockquote>\nThree great reasons.  You want your D&amp;D play to be sorta-similar to TSR D&amp;D, to be inspired by a certain set of fictions, and not based "purely on the rules".  Under absolutely no circumstances does this tell us anything about G, N, or S orientation of you or your group or your game, because all three of those boxes could contain any of those reasons, and probably do at various times.<br/><br/>I don't like spiked chains either, here's my reason: "I just don't fucking like spiked chains."  In any way is it useful to say that I have an "anti-spiked chainsist" Agenda? No. It's correct, in fact it's more correct than saying I have some kind of standard that the spiked chain violates, but it's not useful. This is why classifications of Creative Agendae are always worthless. When we reach that level we've already reached the level of the <i>tastes</i> of the players.  There is no further fruitful way to subdivide it.<br/><br/>So, what do I urge when there's "creative agenda clash", or, what we called for decades, "when players want different things out of the game".  Well, I urge people to work out what they want out of the game, and that can include things just as simple and specific as "I like red-haired NPCs" or "I don't like psychic powers" or something more complicated or top-level-view as "I want to address ethical issues with this character's mind control powers".  Then you work out how badly you want it, in other words, how much you're willing to give in and sit with some stuff that you don't like in order to get some stuff you do like. I don't mind spiked chains in a good D&amp;D3 game so long as I don't have to see them all the fucking time. Things like that.  Where can you "give", where can you not?  And so on.<br/><br/>Anyway, there you go. tl;dr, GNS is bad, Creative Agenda is good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300137/#Comment_300137" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T14:47:51+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  2:47PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems pretty obvious to me that you're playing RtD.

I remember disagreeing with that.<br/><br/>More generally I think it may just be one of those definitional things.

Which seems reasonable within the terminology of CAs, etc., but it's not <i>why we play</i>, you know?<br/><br/>We play because pretending to be an elf is fun, and because storming a castle to rescue a princess is fun.

CA as a concept has led to the development of entirely new forms of play while any number of "some people are rules-lawyers; some people are power-gamers" hasn't gotten us anywhere in design. <br/><br/>And they can absolutely describe games, to an extent - a given game design can support a particular agenda. The reason the distinction is made is, imo, to avoid a) thinking that you can only use a given RPG for one sort of play (it's just some rules. Do what you want with it!) and b) that if player x enjoys game x, he must be type x. If you're just type x, then you don't like any other sort of play. And that's silly and counterproductive - the point is that rules can work in a fashion to facilitate a particular style of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lorrraine" title="Lorrraine"><img alt="Lorrraine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lorrraine">Lorrraine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300196/#Comment_300196" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T00:42:40+00:00" title="November 10, 2010 12:42AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grymbok</cite>I agree with Gregor's summary of Right to Dream as "being there".

As to the rest, Everything else I quoted from Grymbok describes how I feel about "Right to Dream."<br/><br/>When I play a role playing game I want to play my character. I want to get inside her skin and see what makes her tick. I want to see what she will do and what she won't do. I want to inhabit that character completely from the inside out.<br/><br/>The setting matters and it matters deeply because she comes from there, she belongs there, and the thereness of there informs the sort of person she has grown into. At the same time the setting only matters because of how it relates to her. The setting serves as the stage on which she acts, but it only matters because she matters.<br/><br/>I don't just want to play a Jedi. I want to play this particular Jedi. I don't just want to play a Chaosian or an Amberite. I want to play Lydia Lee Cantrell or Tempest Drake or whatever character I choose to play in a given game. I will purpose build a character for a specific game world because that character belongs in that world whereas a character I have played before I could play as visiting that world, but she belongs to the world I first played her in.<br/><br/>I don't care about combat or challenges unless my character cares about them. Half the time I play noncombatants so I can avoid annoying combat rules. If I don't play that I often play Combat experts so I can end the combat quickly and get to the good stuff. I only engage with the narrative or theme if my character cares about the narrative or theme. If it makes the game work better I will create a character who focuses on these things, but mostly I see them as a distraction.<br/><br/>I will gladly spend hours having in character conversations with other characters about pretty much anything except when I play the rare character who doesn't like to talk. I love it when I play with other players who enjoy their characters so much that the story and the game can wait until we feel like engaging with them. I love quizzes, flashbacks, journals, and anything that allows me to explore the character further.<br/><br/>I hate shared GMing, mechanics that tell me what my character thinks or feels, and mechanics (especially dice) that require me to think in game terms rather than character terms. Sometimes I just want all the rules to get out of the way. <br/><br/>Amber Diceless plays better for me than any other game system I have found because it gets out of the way more than any other game system I have found.<br/><br/>I think that "Right to Dream" probably tries to point toward what I want from games, or maybe toward a group of things that people want from games including what I want, but the definitions seem to dance around it and miss it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300205/#Comment_300205" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T03:21:58+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  3:21AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Agenda is about high-level decisions influencing play over a period of time.

Identifying exactly what the taste is and what does or doesn't transgress it is crucial to solving any problem or boosting any good thing about a game.<br/>Let me give you an example of what I mean. <br/><br/>Me and a couple of friends decided to design a space sci-fi game. This was a while ago. We sit down for the first design session and start talking about classes of spaceships and stuff. The issue comes up: can fighters (think BSG Vipers, SW X-Wings) bring down a "titan" class space fortress (Death Star, cylon Basestar)? We start arguing and we go on for hours, literally. It's a matter of taste, right? And we're getting nowhere. Absolutely nowhere.<br/><br/>Here's our arguments. (note: none of us knows anything about CA at this point).<br/>Me: "I think it should be done, because it gives the PCs something to do, go on a cool exciting mission to turn the tide of battle."<br/>Friend 1: "I think it should be done because mid-size ships are good against fighters, and titan ships are good against mid level ships, it should be so that fighters can be good against titan ships. Y'know, rock paper scissors. There's got to be some balance."<br/>Friend 2: "No way in hell it can be done. That's not how it is. These big ships have shields and lots of guns, it doesn't make sense to me."<br/><br/>And we couldn't agree on it, because it was a matter of taste. <br/><br/>Now, looking back, if we had said "in <i>this</i> game, are there winners, protagonists or what?", the question would be solved instantly. It would turn out we didn't want to design the same game and perhaps had to design several games to please everyone, but at least it would be clear to us which of our the three answers was "right". (hint: it's only right if it coincides with the game's CA)<br/><br/>So whether you like spiked chains or not has nothing to do with agenda per se, that's taste. Agenda is not in the nitty-gritty stuff and it's not in the moment-to-moment decisions. I say "high-level decisions" because it's the big arrow that pierces the boxes in the big model. <br/>So, can fighters kill deathstars? I dunno, that's taste. Can fighters kill deathstars <i>in this game</i>? Depends on our agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300241/#Comment_300241" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T08:32:11+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  8:32AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lorrraine</cite>When I play a role playing game I want to play my character.

This agenda (Creative or not) is one of several that I enjoy, and I have at least two friends who would have put it exactly the same way you did. Check out my post <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=300227" rel="nofollow">here</a> where I'm describing what they like, if you want to check on this. I think this isdifferent from "let's be true to a particular setting/genre", although, as you say, if a character is born of a particular world, then they need that world in order to make sense.<br/><br/>The question on my mind is: what does the game have to provide so that actual play is enjoyable for you? Obviously, intrusive mechanics and people with completely different and conflicting agendas are not helpful. But would a game that consisted only of an endless dinner party conversation keep your interest? Or do you need a situation of some kind, even if only at the table? <br/><br/>Put another way, what are the most satisfying moments in play for you? What is this "good stuff" you mention, and when is it at its best?<br/><br/>I'd like to answer this question for myself.

You need something to talk about. On the other hand I could quite easily play High School the Rpg and have my character gossip, try out for the cheerleading squad, pass notes in class, and generally do fairly mundane activities. In fact in the Amber game I play in our PCs went so far as to crank up the speed of the universe so that monster invasions would stop interrupting our characters' high school time. So yes, some sort of situation helps.<br/><br/>The most satisfying moments in play come when a character develops to the point where I can no longer predict what she will do. When the character comes alive and tells me that no she does not plan to do the thing that I thought made sense she wants to do this other thing over here then I can step back and let the character run through her paces. I like it when my characters take emotional risks, as opposed to challenges or bangs. When Gail Weathers finally worked up the nerve to tell Starchild she found her attractive and faced the possibility of rejection that really moved me and changed the game for her. Tempest has ridden something of an emotional roller coaster, but what do you expect from a seventeen year old. Tempest started as a disaffected art student hiding her vulnerability behind sarcastic remarks and clove cigarettes, then she began to open up and try to get to know people and she has recently had her atheist beliefs thrown deeply into question pushing her to take another look at the fundamentalist faith she had as a child. She recently had a long conversation with another PC about humility. I love this game.<br/><br/>Games generally work best when for me as a player when we take a goodly amount of time with character creation. It helps to establish not only my character's background, but how she knows the other characters, why they associate with one another and how they relate to one another. It also helps to find out if the GM or players have any expectations about the character in advance. I don't mind creating a character who will work as a team member or engage with a particular theme as long as I know in advance. I don't mind if a game has conflicts and bangs, but the good stuff happens in the quiet time between those events. Sandboxes and games that build off the character's choices work well as long as they include the space to back off talk things through and not choose anything every so often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300446/#Comment_300446" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T12:48:21+00:00" title="November 11, 2010 12:48PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lorraine,<br/>\n<br/>\nYour second paragraph is really interesting.

At the moment we have three active players who have remained active from the start of the game as well as a GM. I play Tempest. The second player plays Sekina. The third plays Brian and later Nicole. As to similar scenes, Brian, a shapeshifter with serious father issues, creates Nicole as an alternate personality and then comes to realize he has a responsibility to her which reminds him deeply of his own parental issues. Sekina, a sorceress with an extremely powerful psyche, finds herself taking on the mantle of the world and becoming the demiurge. She's wrestling with powers she does not understand and a fierce need to protect the world and everyone in it. Sekina's cat will also give birth to named and numbered kittens any time now. Psychic contact with the proto-kittens has preduced a number of emotional squee scenes for Sekina.  All the PCs have also had to confront the possibility that the parents who raised us probably formerly had lives as bug like monsters. Additionally all three PCs plan to try out for the cheerleading squad as soon as the game calender advances to Wednesday evening.<br/><br/>These scenes definitely inform play going forward. The scenes change the characters and the characters change the game. If Tempest had not come out of her shell none of the characters would have thought of trying out for the cheerleading squad. Tempests crisis of faith will almost certainly strongly impact how the group as a whole responds to the monster invasion. The GM and players all put a lot of emphasis on dialogue scenes, The back story gets addressed fairly concretely. In particular the recent return of Tempest's long absent Father comes directly out of Tempest's back story and has acted as a catalyst to bring on Tempest's crisis of faith. I don't think that the GM expected Tempest's crisis of Faith when she made the decision to bring in Tempest's father as an NPC, but she has certainly worked with it since.<br/><br/>The players and GM definitely provide a supportive environment for taking emotional risks. The sessions give time and space where such things can occur. While out of character talk and even jokes sometimes occur, they don't interrupt deep emotional scenes. NPCs have depth and lives that go beyond interacting with the PCs. The game has a fairly slow pace with significant chunks taking place in real time or if the players have separate scenes running simultaneously sometimes at a fraction of real time. The players occasionally joke about the "longest weekend ever."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300487/#Comment_300487" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T19:12:02+00:00" title="November 11, 2010  7:12PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You and your group's CA is definitely Narr, Lorraine.

I can only provide an internal view for myself obviously anyway. When you look at the externals of course you see issues because the externals exclude the emotional states that stand at the heart of the game. And yes the game does have a story, but frankly that stands as the part of the game we find least engaging. Still, like I said earlier, it gives us something to talk about.<br/><br/>If I understand Narr at all it has to do with providing dilemmas. Pick an issue. Present choices with consequences. Rinse. Repeat. Not our thing at all.<br/><br/>Sekina's player doesn't engage with the choices of what to do with her massive power. She engages with what it feels like to have power and a sense of duty as a seventeen year old girl. And the proto-kittens engage purring in her mind engage her at least as much as the power.<br/><br/>Brian's player didn't create Nicole in response to events in the game. He created her as a though experiment that got out of control. The emotional impact came as a surprise to the player. <br/><br/>Tempests reunion with her father brought her tremendous joy because she lost him and the rest of her family at age 10. She also turned her back on God and religion when she lost them. Her crisis of faith comes from reexamining that long ago decision.<br/><br/>When the three things that the players most look forward to in the game consist of cheerleader tryouts, the birth of kittens, and long conversations about humility I have trouble seeing the game as narrativist. None of these things have any inherent conflict or dilemma. (We're pretty much shoe-ins as cheerleader candidates.)<br/><br/>Yes the game has story, and yes we engage with it on occasion. We need something to talk about. I don't think that makes the game narrativist any more than the fact that the characters occasionally fight monsters makes the game gamist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300500/#Comment_300500" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T23:06:19+00:00" title="November 11, 2010 11:06PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lorrraine</cite>If I understand Narr at all it has to do with providing dilemmas. Pick an issue. Present choices with consequences. Rinse. Repeat. Not our thing at all.</blockquote>\nIf it isn't presenting choices <i>that the players give a damn about,</i> then it's not Narrativist play. <br/><br/>Narrativist play has (and this is not a coincidence, but that's another thread) the best and clearest definition of all three of the supposed "CA families," and it is: "games in which players address Premise during the course of play." Premise is capitalized because it's a very specific bit of jargon from drama theorist Lagos Egri, which I'm hopefully not going to mangle too badly here but here's my take: Premise is a moral statement that's left incomplete so that events in the story can complete it, or move towards completing it. In other words, something that the players - and presumably the characters too, but definitely the players - actually care about, because something in it is at stake, and still in play.<br/><br/>If play feels like dilemma-rinse-repeat, then whatever moral questions are behind the dilemma clearly either don't interest the players enough, or the dilemmas aren't being found through good drama - that is, through events connecting genuinely to character. Therefore no Premise, therefore no Narr.<br/><br/>This right here from your post earlier, this screams out Narr to me:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lorrraine</cite>The most satisfying moments in play come when a character develops to the point where I can no longer predict what she will do. When the character comes alive and tells me that no she does not plan to do the thing that I thought made sense she wants to do this other thing over here</blockquote>\nSee, <i>why would the character tell you that, if it didn't matter to her?</i> She wouldn't bother unless some moral statement, even if small or unclear at the time, were at stake. That's pure Narr, and a wonderful way to get at it: slowly building the connection to character that makes it possible.<br/><br/>(But that doesn't mean it's not possible to apply techniques that get one there a little more efficiently. Connection to character is a subtle thing, and personal taste comes into play, but still.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300515/#Comment_300515" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T04:47:23+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  4:47AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for these very detailed and informative responses, Lorrraine (is it meant to have three Rs? I'm assuming so). I appreciate the effort and candour.<br/><br/>I think there's a very interesting disconnection here between the preferences of players like you (and I know there are plenty) and Story Now! as it is generally catered to in RPG designs. Most of the SN! crowd are very Egri-influenced. They work on the basis that choices reveal character, and that therefore what is need to reveal character in play is a series of relevant moral choices, and design accordingly.<br/><br/>Obviously, this doesn't work for you, because you like being in Actor stance, and such games often demand a degree of Author stance from the players, etc., blah. But I think there's a deeper point here. These methods are designed to reveal character *to the audience* (or to the reader). If I read you right, you're not that interested in revealing your character to the other players. On the contrary, your assumption is that they will be getting satisfaction from doing the same thing with their characters as you are with yours. What they make of your character is entirely their business, and not your concern. What you want is an insight into your character that is *experienced* by you, but not necessarily *demonstrated*. Am I on the right track here?<br/><br/>If so, it's not hard to see why mixing players with your preferences with those who like current SN!-type gaming is a recipe for frustration. You're not especially interested in their concerns and will seem like an uncooperative obstacle. Their constant OOC babbling makes it difficult to you to engage in your preferred way, as you keep being handed information that makes life difficult for you. Nightmare.<br/><br/>So while I think I agree with Mike that *in principle* this is perhaps a Narr preference of sorts, if it is then there's a problem. Because the underlying idea of CA is that following the same CA makes everyone at the table happier. That certainly doesn't seem to be the case here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lorrraine" title="Lorrraine"><img alt="Lorrraine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lorrraine">Lorrraine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300517/#Comment_300517" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T05:19:31+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  5:19AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Misuba,<br/><br/>Can you expand on what you mean by moral statement? I come from a Sociology and Philosophy background and those words have a fairly specific meaning in those contexts which I do not think matches what you seem to say here.<br/><br/>In the sense I understand moral statement, Tempest's preoccupation with humility definitely qualifies. It comes from a specific societal context, namely the community in which she grew up and it deals with what people considered right behavior in that context. As someone living and acting in a different community she has to wrestle with whether and to what degree those standards still apply.<br/><br/>Do questions of aesthetics count as moral statements as you use the term? As an artist Tempest makes a lot of her decisions based on what looks right to her.<br/><br/>Does "Oooh that sounds like fun" count as a moral statement? It definitely shows engagement, but I don't see the moral grounds.<br/><br/>Do actions born out of emotions count as moral statements? I (in character) feel lonely so I try to make friends. I (in character) fell love so I try to connect with the object of my affection. You can definitely make a moral statement out of how one ought to go about such things, but the initial drives don't seem like moral statements in and of themselves to me.<br/><br/>Do actions born out of physical needs or sensations count as moral statements. I (in character) feel hungry so I eat. I (in character) crave a cigarette so I smoke. Again, the how can engage with morality, but the needs themselves do not seem especially moral to me.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Lorrraine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300529/#Comment_300529" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T07:23:05+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  7:23AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lorrraine with Three R's,<br/><br/>Just to throw this out there, I'm not seeing the clear Narrativist / Story Now play that others are seeing. I think it's pretty hard to tell from what you've told us. Creative Agenda is really hard to diagnose and it's often not even useful to diagnose unless there's dissatisfaction with the game.<br/><br/>The "most satisfying moments of play" thing only describes moments for one person. It's not showing group reinforcement, so I'm hesitant to see your "when a character comes alive" moments as anything more than a technique or feeling. Getting the character Right just as easily could be part of a Right to Dream CA (and in fact I'm leaning that way, but would need more evidence to back it).<br/><br/>Deep connection to a character is just a technique. Wanting play that highlights that deep connection to a character is a technical agenda, not a creative agenda. That technical agenda can be a tool that supports any creative agenda or none, though I think it supports Right to Dream play better than Story Now play, and I think it supports Step on Up play pretty poorly.<br/><br/>Also, this is important: Story Now is about human issues that are important to the players, not the characters. The character isn't real. The character may feel real to you during play, but it's you. Play that addresses Premise through the eyes of a character is not Story Now play unless it also addresses Premise in a way that resonates with the real players. That is, the players have to care about the human issues. <br/><br/>Imagine a situation where your character cares deeply about some issue -- say, whether the Church accepts the character's conversion or something -- but you-the-player don't care about the issue at all. It'd likely be a rare case, I think (and that's why people in this thread are jumping up and down and pointing at you and yelling about Story Now / Narrativism) but it's possible to separate these things. You can address Premise and not care about it as much as getting the character Right. And that's Right to Dream play, not Story Now.<br/><br/>Yes, I'm saying that addressing Premise is just a technique. I think this flies in the face of some common wisdom about creative agenda. I think I've seen people say that any play that addresses Premise is, by definition, Story Now. I guess it all comes down to the definition of "addresses." If addressing Premise requires a full instance of play that touches on every part of the game and its reward cycle, then that works for me, but that rules out moments of play being able to address Premise. That means that a single scene cannot address Premise. If people believe a single scene can address Premise, then that is a technique and not creative agenda.<br/><br/>Adam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300537/#Comment_300537" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T08:26:10+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  8:26AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2010 8:30AM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, I am intrigued by your proposition regarding Premise-as-technique, and therefore wish to challenge it.<br/><br/>Can you give an actual-play example of a player who is involved in a group that's focused on Story Now, but who is "stealth" RtD in that they are only addressing Premise because it's what their character would do? Since a Stance can sometimes be an internal process rather than something that's explicitly telegraphed during play, this could be tricky. <br/>The second part of my question is: do you think a player who is compelled to only address Premises that their character cares about (even if they, the player, do not) would consistently be dissatisfied by Story Now play? If the answer is yes, we're onto something. If the answer is no, then I'm tempted to say "So what?"<br/><br/>Actually, what you're describing sounds kind of like the definition of "Vanilla Narrativism": \n<blockquote><i>from the provisional glossary:</i> <br/>Vanilla Narrativism<br/><br/>Narrativist play without notable use of the following Techniques: Director Stance, atypical distribution of GM tasks, verbalizing the Premise in abstract terms, overt organization of narration, or improvised additions to the setting or situations. People who typically play in this fashion often fail to recognize their Creative Agenda as Narrativist. See Vanilla Narrativism and the links listed under Points of Contact.<br/></blockquote>\nIt's the lack of overt "thinking out loud" about the narrative that intrigues me here. If a player very faithfully sticks to Actor Stance while addressing Premise, that sounds like Story Now/Narr play to me.<br/><br/>Think of it this way: I'm told that My Life With Master is about dysfunctional relationships, love, and freedom. I design a character who cares about at least one of those things quite a bit. I, the player, am neutral on the subject - I'm happy to watch my little Igor twist in the wind, but I'm compelled to make him strive for freedom because I care a lot about exploring characters' internal motivations. If I, the player, am flatly uninterested in addressing the Premise of MLWM in any way, then I shouldn't play it. But if I show up, make an appropriate character, and explore the Premise through play... how does this not immediately fold into Story Now play? If addressing the Premise in an organic fashion is a player's priority, rather than a commitment to an existing, genre-based array of themes, that's definitionally Story Now play, and not Right to Dream. <br/><br/>One's "Dream", as we define it, extends to all sorts of things in play, not just character motivations. If the only cue of RtD play is Actor Stance, that's not enough information to suggest it.<br/><br/>I just don't see the value in telling a player "You enjoy a new, obscure breed of Sim" rather than simply saying "Yeah, you clearly enjoy elements of Sim play, but Narr play totally sounds like it's your thing, too."<br/><br/>And, of course, there's the issue of players enjoying multiple Creative Agendas (at separate times), which is true for a lot of story-gamers I know, but generally isn't addressed by these conversations. That's not something I'm laying at your feet, Adam, but at the, uh, thread's feet.<br/><br/>Lastly lastly, I'm not saying you're wrong or I'm right about anybody's implied or stated creative agenda. This whole post here is just an exploration of your idea about Premise-as-Technique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300549/#Comment_300549" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T09:21:51+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  9:21AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lorraine,<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what it's worth your play sounds very Story Now to me.  The choices the characters are making in those scenes, even if they are not so much choices but revelations of who the character are, is exactly what we are talking about when we say address premise.  When you say those scenes change the character and the characters change the game that's practically a narrativist manifesto.  It's passionate characters making poweful decisions that affect their lives and reveal what that character values.  I see a full formed agenda in action in the way the gm and the players interact, you say the GM didnt expect the crisis of faith when Tempests father returned but how do you think he will approach it going forward?  I'm imagining that crisis of faith is going to play heavily into the relationship in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first experience with Story Now gaming came in the early 90's with a free form system that bears no resemblance to any of the current indie published games.  We didnt need much in the way of system because we had a gm who could set up fascinating situations and position characters in a way that they had to interact with it  and we had players empowered to interact and willing and able to react to the situation with an emotional connection to the characters.  We felt what the characters felt and as opposed to what Adam says when I'm playing so tightly bound to a character that I can feel what they feel, when they care about an issue so do I.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur games didnt tend to last very long because we'd usually resolve the situations fairly quick and bring a sense of resolution to the game.  We probably could have used some form of system to extend play and sustain the conflicts, build more depth into the game but we had very intense focused play that was great all built on social contract alone.  It sounds to me like you have a group that reads each other very well and are very focused on what you want out of the game.  Are you using a published system and do you think you follow it closely/use the rules much?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300553/#Comment_300553" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T09:46:09+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  9:46AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I back this with actual play? Sadly, no. It's just out-of-my-ass posturing, but see below. <br><br>Mind you, this Story Now group with a stealth Right to Dream member is your straw man, not my example. Technically speaking, that group isn't Story Now; it's incoherent. My example is a bunch of players coherently playing Right to Dream in a way that might, taken in small bites, look to outsiders to be Story Now play because there's behavior that looks like address of Premise by the players, but it's really purist-for-Character focus on what characters believe in. The group doesn't really care if they address Premise at all, even if they happen to be doing it.<br><br>Lorrraine's group may very well be doing this, though; I don't know!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>The second part of my question is: do you think a player who is compelled to only address Premises that their character cares about (even if they, the player, do not) would consistently be dissatisfied by Story Now play? If the answer is yes, we're onto something. If the answer is no, then I'm tempted to say "So what?"</blockquote>\nIs your example a logical impossibility? Story Now play is a complete instance of play in which all participants reinforce a common aesthetic involving the address of human issues (Premise). If one of those players doesn't care about addressing Premise, how can that be Story Now play? <br><br>But I'll play along for a moment. Story Now doesn't require players to want to do it. It just requires them to do it. So if a player is "compelled" (I don't know how) to address a Premise that they don't care about, but they still did it and managed to keep up the social, exploratory, and technical reinforcement of that aesthetic, then I'd hesitantly call it Story Now. Crappy Story Now, but Story Now nonetheless. <br/><br/>Push comes to shove, I think the players have to want it to be able to reinforce the aesthetic in any meaningful way. \n<blockquote>Actually, what you're describing sounds kind of like the definition of "Vanilla Narrativism":</blockquote>\nRealize that the definition of Vanilla Narrativism starts with Narrativism, which requires social, exploratory, and technical reinforcement a full instance of play. While the players may or may not realize that they're addressing Premise, they will be able to look back at the game and know that exploring human issues was the crux of play for them, what made it good. <br/><br/>Lorrraine is saying that those issues don't really matter to her and her group; that getting into character and finding out what happens to them -- playing the character Right -- is what the group values most. To me, that says Right to Dream.<br/><br/>Your My Life with Master example is good, but a little flawed. If you explore Premise through play and the group all vibes on that, then that's Story Now. And I'll tell you, it's hard to play that game as written and not do that. A "player's priority" doesn't matter for beans if the rest of the group isn't rewarding it. You can't see creative agenda under a microscope that way. Replace the term "creative agenda" with "group play style" and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>Definitionally, creative agenda is a thing a) for a group and b) for a given and complete length of play. If either of those is missing, you're probably looking at techniques or other small stuff, not creative agenda. So one dude addressing Premise seems it cannot create Story Now play, voila! just like that. Because a single player can play a) with different groups b) at different times, it is possible for that player to enjoy different creative agendas.<br/><br/>Right to Dream play has many cues, but no single cue ever identifies creative agenda. To describe a group's play as Right to Dream, I'd want confirmation that the entire group was reinforcing "getting it Right" at all levels of the Big Model. I'd want to see social reinforcement (positive and negative). I'd want to understand what parts of the fiction/system were most important to the players and how they reinforced these priorities. I'd want to identify specific techniques the players used to reinforce "getting it Right," especially those techniques that differentiated from the rules-as-written. That's how I identify another group's creative agenda.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>I just don't see the value in telling a player "You enjoy a new, obscure breed of Sim" rather than simply saying "Yeah, you clearly enjoy elements of Sim play, but Narr play totally sounds like it's your thing, too."</blockquote>\nHrm. I don't think I did that. And I don't know that Story Now play is gonna be her thing at all, cuz I have no faith that she-the-person is interested in addressing Premise even in an indirect, through-one's-character way. She may be doing it, but she doesn't seem to care about the /issues/, only getting the character Right.<br/><br/>Also, I don't think I'd describe this as an obscure breed of Sim! It's pretty much typical purist-for-character Right to Dream play, no? People have been doing this for 35 years.<br/><br/>But without a lot more information about Lorrraine's actual play, I'm very hesitant to stamp a label on it.

If so, then... maybe! But maybe at a couple levels of remove, you know? I couldn't say.<br/><br/>And as we all keep hammering away at this, I just want to plug in that I'm a big believer that a possible, or even probable answer to the question of which "CA family" your play belongs in is: none of the above. That doesn't make it agendaless, nor "zilchplay" - it just makes it unique and individual to your group. We can <i>read</i> any play as having a letter G, N, or S stamped on it if we try hard enough (and as you can see, we try mightily). But it's not always very useful information in the end. (I see Narrativism as more of a deliberately designed <i>target</i> than the others, as opposed to a category, which is part of why I get excited about it.

It's not really any different than liking Gurps but not liking D&amp;D.;  Just because you show a preference for a CA doesnt mean you like all implementations of the agenda.   If I say I like watching sports does it mean I'll enjoy going to a baseball game as much as I do going to a hockey game?  That's like a difference within agendas a difference across agendas would be me saying I like Hockey but not revealing that my knees are too banged up to enjoy playing the game much anymore but I like watching the games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason CA's are problematic is that play with differing preference has been a common problem and one that is often hard to diagnose.  If we all think we're role playing and not realizing that means different things to each of us we run into a problem.  Just knowing the CA in play isnt a panacea though.  There can still be different ideas on how to get there even if we know the destination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300577/#Comment_300577" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T11:54:32+00:00" title="November 12, 2010 11:54AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lorraine, for what it's worth, I'm with Adam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300593/#Comment_300593" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T12:37:53+00:00" title="November 12, 2010 12:37PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, I'm with Adam too. I also agree there's no particular point in stamping a label on this pretty common play preference just for the sake of doing so. I'm interested in it because (moan, whinge!) I have at least two players in my regular group who hold this preference very strongly, and it makes it impossible to even consider playing a whole set of recent interesting games (mostly of the hippy indie persuasion). If someone were to write some games specifically supporting this stance, I'd be very interested in trying them out, because my group is far from against new games per se.<br><br>Vernon, you and I will have to politely disagree. My experience is that the differences involved are far more profound and intractable than just preferring D&amp;D to GURPS. I know people with this preference who don't think games like DitV are even roleplaying games, mostly because of the problem of staying in Actor stance. They are quite willing to believe that people have fun playing them, but they don't see such games as being the thing that they love doing. If that's not a clash of Creative Agendas, I don't know what is.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300599/#Comment_300599" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T12:52:45+00:00" title="November 12, 2010 12:52PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br><br>Sorry for being a lazy thread-reader, but what player preference are you referring to?<br/><br/>If it's "I want to stay in Actor Stance", what part of DitV breaks that for them?<br/><br/>Dpending on the answer, Don't Rest Your Head might be a good option...                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300603/#Comment_300603" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T13:00:06+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  1:00PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one thing that's critical in Lorrraine's example of play - and is being largely overlooked in the rush to identify a CA - is this\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lorrraine</cite>Games generally work best when for me as a player when we take a goodly amount of time with character creation. It helps to establish not only my character's background, but how she knows the other characters, why they associate with one another and how they relate to one another. It also helps to find out if the GM or players have any expectations about the character in advance. I don't mind creating a character who will work as a team member or engage with a particular theme as long as I know in advance. I don't mind if a game has conflicts and bangs, but the good stuff happens in the quiet time between those events. Sandboxes and games that build off the character's choices work well as long as they include the space to back off talk things through and not choose anything every so often.</blockquote>\nI dimly recall a long conversation <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2005/12/qien_es_mas_mac.html" rel="nofollow">on this topic</a> several years ago in which the term "aerobic" narrativism was batted around to describe exactly this technical preference. I was then, and remain, unconvinced that this is practically distinguishable from agendaless play for an outside observer, and I do think it is a horribly difficult kind of play to maintain as coherent over time, but it presents an ongoing challenge to the notion of CA existing across a unitary course of play.<br/><br/>This seems to me evidence that CA - where it is evident at all in a group's play - is evident only by examination of the moments of coherence within the larger context of exploration. I think most play, for most groups, most of the time, does not happen in a state of coherence. It is to one degree or another "zilchy" or what I like to call "parallel play". Coherence emerges at moments of focus when the group is entrained together in the creation of the fiction, but much fiction-creation happens in subsets or individuals and doesn't "collapse" into coherence for the group-as-a-whole.<br/><br/>The Forgeian style in design, to my mind, has largely been in pursuit of a technical goal - to make coherence happen on a more-or-less ongoing pace in a shorter instance-of-play. This technique preference has overwhelmingly been confused for the Story Now CA it best facilitates; but Story Now can also occur in a more diffuse form as moments of coherence against a much larger backdrop of parallel or agendaless play. Such play often looks like RTD to observers, and also to participants who accept the equivalency between Story Now and hard-focus "anaerobic" play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300608/#Comment_300608" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T13:16:46+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  1:16PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/><br/>Good call.<br/><br/>A friend ran a drifted D&amp;D game for 20 years.  The characters sat around a lot, talked to NPCs, acted quirky, pushed their personal concepts a bit, spent money on loot.  The players took turns being interested and bored.<br/><br/>Then they'd pick a mission and there would be a journey, and the GM would show off his cool world.  And where that happened to intersect with a character's goals, that player got excited.  Otherwise, it was largely about being an audience for this nicely detailed and real-feeling place.  Some players dug that more than others.<br/><br/>At the end of the journey would be a dungeon.  The players would try to beat the dungeon.  Full-on Gamist play.  Real deaths, real losses, tons of time spent on strategy and lovin' it.<br/><br/>Looking at the 20 years, I guess you could call this Gamist play with a ton of dead space.  But I like your take of intermittent coherence better.<br/><br/>It's also weird to note that there was some RTD-style socializing for given sessions.  But I don't think that was what kept people coming back -- the rewards were intermittent, not a cycle -- so we couldn't really say "a Right to Dream CA existed".<br/><br/>I could guess that the game was like the lottery, where the chance that<i> this </i>session will be the one where you get to Step On Up kept everyone coming back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300613/#Comment_300613" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T13:31:43+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  1:31PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Sorry for being a lazy thread-reader, but what player preference are you referring to?</blockquote>\nLorrraine's, broadly speaking.

So, maybe go play some of those games, and see what you think! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300639/#Comment_300639" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T15:31:46+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  3:31PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2010 3:33PM by jdfristrom.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is an example of why I'm not crazy about Forge jargon, particularly Big Model.<br/><br/>In fact, the main thing that draws me here rather than The Forge is usually the lack of jargon (it's called Story Games, not Narrativist Games, for example)<br/><br/>As is often the case, <a href="http://www.costik.com/weblog/2004_10_01_blogchive.html#109716795298731530" rel="nofollow">Greg Costikyan said it better than I could</a>.<br/><br/>Though I would add, Big Model particularly bothers me because it implies that you can divide everything into one of three types (or maybe I only think that because Costikyan was my gateway to the forge, and that's how he said it worked), but then rather rigidly defines what those types are.

I'm assuming so). I appreciate the effort and candour..</blockquote>\nAnd thank you. Yes, the 3 Rs I chose deliberately as an online thing. Offline I only have 2 Rs.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>I think there's a very interesting disconnection here between the preferences of players like you (and I know there are plenty) and Story Now! as it is generally catered to in RPG designs. Most of the SN! crowd are very Egri-influenced. They work on the basis that choices reveal character, and that therefore what is need to reveal character in play is a series of relevant moral choices, and design accordingly.<br/><br/>Obviously, this doesn't work for you, because you like being in Actor stance, and such games often demand a degree of Author stance from the players, etc., blah. But I think there's a deeper point here. These methods are designed to reveal character *to the audience* (or to the reader). If I read you right, you're not that interested in revealing your character to the other players. On the contrary, your assumption is that they will be getting satisfaction from doing the same thing with their characters as you are with yours. What they make of your character is entirely their business, and not your concern. What you want is an insight into your character that is *experienced* by you, but not necessarily *demonstrated*. Am I on the right track here?</blockquote>\nI think that focusing on what the other players perceive would mean focusing on something largely outside of my control. No matter what I do with my character the other players will see everything both through the filter of their own preconceptions and the preconceptions of their characters. If instead I stay true to my character and inhabit her thoughts and emotions as much as possible then the interactions feel more genuine and less staged to me. I have tried to show off and impress the other players with my cleverness in the past, but these days I find myself buying into the idea of awesome as the enemy. Doing the thing or saying the thing that seems obvious to my character and to me works so much better.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Deep connection to a character is just a technique. Wanting play that highlights that deep connection to a character is a technical agenda, not a creative agenda. That technical agenda can be a tool that supports any creative agenda or none, though I think it supports Right to Dream play better than Story Now play, and I think it supports Step on Up play pretty poorly.</blockquote>\nI have no attachment to whether the games I enjoy focus on a technical or a creative agenda. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Also, this is important: Story Now is about human issues that are important to the players, not the characters. The character isn't real. The character may feel real to you during play, but it's you. Play that addresses Premise through the eyes of a character is not Story Now play unless it also addresses Premise in a way that resonates with the real players. That is, the players have to care about the human issues.<br/><br/>Imagine a situation where your character cares deeply about some issue -- say, whether the Church accepts the character's conversion or something -- but you-the-player don't care about the issue at all. It'd likely be a rare case, I think (and that's why people in this thread are jumping up and down and pointing at you and yelling about Story Now / Narrativism) but it's possible to separate these things. You can address Premise and not care about it as much as getting the character Right. And that's Right to Dream play, not Story Now.</blockquote>\nI can't give you an example of where a character cares about something and I as player don't. When I get into character I care about the things my character does pretty much universally. I can however give you an example easily of things I care about that my player doesn't. Tempest sees History as Bunk. She has no interest in politics. I love playing political characters in other games, but when I play Tempest we do our best to short circuit the politics. When we can't I have the voice of a bored seventeen year old girl in my head. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite><br/><br/>For what it's worth your play sounds very Story Now to me. The choices the characters are making in those scenes, even if they are not so much choices but revelations of who the character are, is exactly what we are talking about when we say address premise. When you say those scenes change the character and the characters change the game that's practically a narrativist manifesto. It's passionate characters making poweful decisions that affect their lives and reveal what that character values. I see a full formed agenda in action in the way the gm and the players interact, you say the GM didnt expect the crisis of faith when Tempests father returned but how do you think he will approach it going forward? I'm imagining that crisis of faith is going to play heavily into the relationship in the future.</blockquote>\nKnowing my GM, she will probably only have characters react to Tempest's crisis of faith to the extent that Tempest makes it obvious to them through conversation or behavior. While Tempest's father has become aware of the crisis neither of them seem likely to actually talk about this with each other any time soon. Instead Tempest's relationships with Sekena, Dave (NPC acting student) and Sue (Head cheerleader) will likely have the greatest impact while the relationship with her father remains largely untouched by it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>My first experience with Story Now gaming came in the early 90's with a free form system that bears no resemblance to any of the current indie published games. We didnt need much in the way of system because we had a gm who could set up fascinating situations and position characters in a way that they had to interact with it and we had players empowered to interact and willing and able to react to the situation with an emotional connection to the characters. We felt what the characters felt and as opposed to what Adam says when I'm playing so tightly bound to a character that I can feel what they feel, when they care about an issue so do I.<br/><br/>Our games didnt tend to last very long because we'd usually resolve the situations fairly quick and bring a sense of resolution to the game. We probably could have used some form of system to extend play and sustain the conflicts, build more depth into the game but we had very intense focused play that was great all built on social contract alone. It sounds to me like you have a group that reads each other very well and are very focused on what you want out of the game. Are you using a published system and do you think you follow it closely/use the rules much?</blockquote>\nYes, we use a published system: Amber Diceless. No, we don't use the rules much. No one other than me even bothers to bring a copy of the rules to the game, including the GM.<br/><br/>(More responses to follow)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13320/agendaless-zilchplay-and-how-it-works-for-me" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13320/agendaless-zilchplay-and-how-it-works-for-me" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13320/agendaless-zilchplay-and-how-it-works-for-me/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13320%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13320%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
