For those who don't know, internet relay chat just means a chatroom. My online games have been very well received in the past, and the setting and content of the games will be entirely up to the group. Post here or contact if you're interested. Example games that I've run in the past:<br/>\n-Four researchers studying the Voynich Manuscript unleash terror in the mountains...<br/>\n-A group of students are placed in an abandoned school and are told the last one alive may leave...<br/>\n-Dinosaurs invade the earth but get more than they bargained for when they run into zombies...<br/>\n-A zesty detective finds herself embroiled in the 1960s Parisian heroin trade...<br/>\n-A young man comes to terms with an impending world war in his hometown in Ireland...<br/>\n-An officer of the CIA's Special Activities Division must fight for his life in the fog of war...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322007/#Comment_322007" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T21:20:45+00:00" title="April 27, 2011  9:20PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're interested in an established group, we have a room on gryphon.magicstar.net called #indierpgs which sounds a lot like you're describing. Ever been by? If not, stop on in some time and say hi. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone, really. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
