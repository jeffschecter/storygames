Does a very short questionnaire would work ?

I'd just do one or two scenes, with one single question ("How did I lose my memory?" perhaps) and prewritten extra-juicy memory prompts. Cut as much out as possible, so you don't have to explain most of the rules at all.  <br/><br/>Start with a single penny for yourself, play a scene focusing on your character and having your prospective players give the alternate ways for you to act (get to this point quickly).  Once you give the penny away, wrap up your scene, then start a scene for the person who got the penny.  At this point you can explain the rules for being the protagonist of the scene (describe everything except your character acting, etc.) and play until they give the penny away.<br/><br/>After those two scenes, you'll probably have spent five or ten minutes playing and they'll start to have a good idea what the game is like.<br/><br/>I haven't tried it, but I think that's how I'd do it if I had to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405998/#Comment_405998" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T23:53:54+00:00" title="February 11, 2013 11:53PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Nick.
