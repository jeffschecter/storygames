Thanks, Lizzie (buy her book, <i>Leaving Mundania</i>, right now--if you have a copy, buy another for a friend or relative). <br/><br/>I am asking for donations to help bring larps to the classroom. A playtest of our second larp, <b>Hit Seekers</b>, is just about over. But other schools would like to get the kit/box, and we need help to make that happen. If you can't help with money, maybe mention this or post it around? We're in an LAUSD school whose funding was cut. The graduation rate of LASUD is 55%. That's high school graduation, not college admission. LAUSD is in a death match with UTLA, the teacher's union. I don't want to pick sides, I just want kids to learn. So please help. <br/><br/><a href="http://kck.st/Kb0aA1" rel="nofollow">Hit Seekers Kickstarter Campaign</a><br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Aaron                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dbrown" title="dbrown"><img alt="dbrown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/133/nMWVBVRKLGUBK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dbrown">dbrown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382628/#Comment_382628" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-17T22:22:53+00:00" title="June 17, 2012 10:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going on a mini Kickstarter splurge as a Father's Day gift to myself. As an educator, I'm really interested to see the videos from these classes and maybe some lesson plans. I think what I'm doing in the language courses I teach is larpish, but since I've never larped, I'm not entirely sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AaronJV" title="AaronJV"><img alt="AaronJV" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AaronJV">AaronJV</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382649/#Comment_382649" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T03:08:04+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  3:08AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks! Larpish is fine, IMHO. For this class, we are very larp-lite. They're pretending to be themselves, but executives at a record company that they name. See my email for more info on edu-larp. Cheers!
