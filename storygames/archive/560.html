                    I want to know the design technique you've encountered that currently fills you with transcendent joy, in each of these four categories:<br/><br/><b>Creating characters</b><br/><b>Creating situation, setting, and color</b><br/><b>Generating and resolving conflicts</b><br/><b>Growing characters and situation</b><br/><br/>They don't have to be cutting edge or esoteric.  They can build on prior art, so no "Shadowrun did that first!", please.  Obviously good ideas are many, but here are mine, off the top of my head:<br/><br/><b>Creating characters</b><br/>Keys in the Shadow of Yesterday - "Here's what I'm about, and you know I'm serious because I picked it, and I get a fat reward when I do the thing that is most fun to me!"  Simple and great.<br/><br/><b>Creating situation, setting, and color</b><br/>The "engineering the situation" procedure from the upcoming Full Light, Full Steam.  Highly collaborative, highly specific, and highly easy for the GM to put together into satisfying scenes, sessions, and campaigns.  Since it was a closed playtest I'll let Josh explain more if he likes.<br/><br/><b>Generating and resolving conflicts</b><br/>Vincent Baker's nascent AG&amp;G has you roll dice in a conflict before defining the stakes.  It sounds counter-intuitive but it totally works.  Also highly awesome - you are mechanically rewarded for taking on opponents more bad-ass than yourself, and the reward is not reflected in the actual conflict.  So you can lose, and lose bad, and still get a juicy reward.  <br/><br/><b>Growing characters and situation</b><br/>The accomplishment phase in Dogs in the Vineyard, where you get to learn the system while simultaneously growing your character into somebody worth playing.  That's a fucking great idea.<br/><br/>How about it?                </div>

<b>Creating Characters, Situation, Setting, and Color</b><br/>
Anything based on taking some relatively random starting-point and then expanding with free association of ideas. Like the word web in Emily's <i>Breaking the Ice</i>. I'm using something similar for setting creation in the fantasy game I'm working on. For my pet project that I don't think I've mentioned to anyone yet, character generation works by starting with a picture of a big crowd of people, like at a sports event or protest, and making up stories about the guys and gals in the photo. I like this kind of thing because it gives organic results that everyone's invested in.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Generating and Resolving Conflicts</b><br/>
Task based combat systems with tactical resource management. Like D&amp;D. Because it's fun as hell.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Growing Characters and Situation</b><br/>
I've always liked the concept behind traits in Burning Wheel. Just little snippets that describe your character. There's a lot of potential there for expansion into more detailed systems where players change one another's characters and introduce situation elements based off of one another's traits.                        </div>

<p>Tough freakin' question.</p>
<p>Hmm...  Most of these answers are gonna come from the problems that I'm currently trying to iron out for <em>Invisible Shepherds</em>.  But, of course, I was inspired to tackle those problems by other designs &amp; designers.  I'll list my inspirations instead of constantly pimping a design in progress.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Characters, Setting, Situation, and Color</strong><br>
Shopping lists, baby.  Properly made shopping lists of locations, weapons, tools, vehicles, skills, abilities, powerz, etc. can evoke fantastic situation and color.  Inspired by blog posts of Vincent's as well as playtesting "Grey Ranks".</br></p>
<p><strong>Generating and Resolving Conflicts</strong><br>
What I'm currently riffing on here is the ol' classic combo of "Ok, I wanna do this..." followed by "Yeah, but the probem is this..." adjudicated by some dice rolling and then having the result narrated by the player with the 'winning' roll.  Ok, so the winner of the roll gaining the resolution narration isn't all that classic, but the "I wanna..." + "Yeah, but..." are totally classic.</br></p>
<p>I have no idea if that made any sense to anyone out there, but it works out perfectly in my head.</p>
<p><strong>Growing Characters and Situation</strong><br>
Organically grown.  Like, a little bit of old-school co-operative logic (Killing the king's favorite son will certainly make the king mad at you) with a rich fertalizer of Paying Attention To What You Really Want.  PTA-issues-style.  I think.  Never actually played PTA, but there's a mechanism I've been fiddling with that keeps reminding me of PTA issues.</br></p>

<p><strong>Creating Characters</strong><br>
I really like the technique of building a situation and then choosing characters out of it to play. It protects from the "serial one-on-one" syndrome nicely.</br></p>
<p><strong>Creating Color</strong><br>
Keywords and reward mechanisms; I have these in SFK and Torchbearer, and I'm really curious to see how they work in Stranger Things.</br></p>
<p><strong>Growing Characters &amp; Situations</strong><br>
I don't know about this one yet; I've been experimenting lately with situations that are closed and thereby compressed.</br></p>

<b>Creating characters</b><br/>Player-authored traits.  These babies put loads of flag-waving setting-building game-steering goodness into players hands, and do it in such a way that most folks don't even notice, but they play shines, anyway.<br/><br/><b>Creating situation, setting, and color</b><br/>Explicit, step-by-step procedures for situation creation.  Jason mentioned FLFS's Engineered Situations above, so I'll toot my own horn.  Taking flags from player sheets and pregame discussion, you create three or four conflicts (character + desire + obstacle), double up the elements of those conflicts (conflict A's object of desire is conflict B's obstacle), relate them to the characters (conflict C's obstacle is your brother), and quickly stat them up.  You're set.<br/><br/><b>Generating and resolving conflicts</b><br/>Do I lose my membership card if I say this is perhaps the least interesting part of RPG design for me?  Resolution systems are a dime a dozen.  Right now I'm all starry-eyed at setting up the conflicts and situations that get resolved in play.<br/><br/><b>Growing characters and situation</b><br/>Resolution of conflicts and judging when a situation is dead is my current bugaboo.  I'd love to hear anybody's thoughts on this one.                        </div>

                            This is like further evidence that I'm from a different planet...<br/><br/><b>Creating characters</b><br/><br/>Lately, I've been really into NOT having character creation, at least as it's traditionally meant.  My last 3 and 1/2 game designs have all had a limited set of predetermined characters that the players can choose from.  Not all details are defined, of course, and some things are left for the players to determine during play, especially aspects of portrayal and personaluty.  But, yeah, I seem to be on a "Let's play Calico Jack, Mary Read, and Anne Bonnay" kick, instead of "Let's play a pirate love triangle!  Okay, time to fill out the character sheets!"<br/><br/><b>Creating situation, setting, and color</b><br/><br/>Following from the stuff above, I've recently been psyched about creating interesting situations and color through the severe limitation of player choices while allowing for unconstrained expression of character.  I was just talking about this with Dev.  Give the characters a limited number of things that can do and watch the players be extremely creative in using them.  This is a strong principle in classic video game design, actually.  Remember Mario?  Mario can do two things, really: run and jump.  But the way he uses those two abilities to interact with his environment leads to endless play possibilities.  So you construct a limited set of possible character choices that interact in such a way that dramatic situations are impossible to avoid.<br/><br/>Now imagine a slightly extended ability set for a roleplaying character and then a player who is allowed to freely express the character however they like in a non-mechanically supported way.  So maybe you want to have a snowball fight but there are no rules to govern snowball fighting.  You can freeform the fight (just like you would a conversation or a dance sequence between two characters) and it becomes an expression of character, having no mechanical weight but revealing interesting details. <br/><br/><b>Generating and resolving conflicts</b><br/><br/>I've been running in the opposite direction of conflict resolution in the past 6-12 months of design work.  My recent games have not had a seperate conflict resolution system.  I don't think you really need one any more than you need a seperate combat system.  You can probably take the system for getting into situations and reuse it as a way of getting out of those same situations.<br/><br/><b>Growing characters and situation</b><br/><br/>I am still in love with the character development system that Shreyas (and me too, some) worked out for one of the original drafts of <i>Torchbearer</i>.  Characters change as a result of a personal crisis in which they must make a choice.  Characters cannot escape a crisis.  Choosing to avoid or ignore a crisis is still a choice, and they change as a result of that decision.  In the original <i>Torchbearer</i> drafts, characters didn't just change, they transformed like butterfly larvae, they were reborn as a new person, it was a baptismal experience.  I like the idea of smaller crises as well, though.  Personal revelations, relationship choices, that sort of thing.  But, yeah, growth because of personal choices and not due to things accomplished or things that happened to a character.<br/><br/>I have to think a little more on growing situation.                        </div>

<b>Creating characters</b><br/><br/>I'm excited for what I want to do with my Poe game - have character creation make the players explicity say "THESE are the things that are the most important to how I see my character, and THESE are the things that are cool but not necessary, and THESE things are just color," and then tie those delineations into the resolution system.<br/><br/><b>Creating situation, setting, and color</b><br/><br/>I'm trying to make myself remember that I am a creative person, and I can provide setting and color that other people may be interested in. It's what gets me into a lot of games, after all - not every game needs to have those created from scratch.<br/><br/>As for creating situation, I got nuthin right now.<br/><br/><b>Generating and resolving conflicts</b><br/><br/>I like tying resolution directely into the reward systems. I also want to play some of the cool fighty-games that people are always talking about that are very tactical and crunchy.<br/><br/><b>Growing characters and situation</b><br/><br/>I have an idea for my next game after my Poe game that will designed to be able to be played literally by reading through the rulebook from the first page and following the instructions. It will start out as a very tight procedural game - team gets a call, goes out and investigates, suffers a setback, and then resolves the situation. Each iteration of this will give the players and GM resources to build up backstory for their characters, and bringing that backstory into the game will provide phat advantages and other kinds of resources, and thus a plot will growout of that backstory, eventually turning the game into a crazy intense character-driven psycho-drama.<br/><br/>Or so is the hope.                        </div>

                            Jonathan is stealing about half my brain, Joshua RamaGupta is stealing the other half. I am afraid. <br/><br/><b>Creating Characters, Not Creating Stats</b><br/><br/>Stats as stats suck shit. I don't want to know how far I can throw, I don't want to know how fast I can run. I want to know why my character is my character. I want to know what his issue is and how it is about to explode. I want to have a thing, and then I want to get moving. Player defined traits can do this, in the right context. So can template characters like those in Crime and Punishment. Either way, I want a way to make a character, not a list of stats and attributes. <br/><br/>And yes, that means that I'm currently rejecting the idea of "I'll make my list of stats and attribute and them divine a character from those." Sure, I know that can work, but I don't want to do it anymore. <br/><br/><b>Situation and Character: Kick Out the Third Leg</b><br/><br/>Whatever you are making: character, situation, setting, conflict -- I want there to be systematic limitations that force the structure to be unstable. I don't want perfect little tripods of creation that can sit there until someone chooses to climb up and have a view. I want everything falling over. Not on the verge of falling over -- falling fucking over now. So when I go to create my nice stable little situation with my lovely little village full of lovely little pastoral hobbits, I want something in the game to force me at gunpoint to fuck with it until it screams. <br/><br/>Dogs town creation does this, forcing unstable situations. But I want games that do that at different levels -- not just the town, but the characters, the setting, the whole damn game. (Not necessarily all at once, but hey, that would gain bonus points.) A lot of other games do this to small extents, but mostly by giving suggestions to players and GMs about how they create their situations and characters -- not by actually making them do it that way. Suggestions are nice, and pretty, and very stable. Fuck em. <br/><br/><b>Conflcit Resolution: Birthing Conflict from Turmoil</b><br/><br/>When you resolve a conflict, win or lose, nothing should be over until it is ALL over. Until the terminal moment of a game, every conflict should directly and unequivocally generate a new conflict. Rather than hearing "You get a Total Victory, you win!" I want to hear "You get a Total Victory, you win Ã¢â‚¬â€œ now you also must say what goes wrong because you won!" Part of conflict resolution isn't just resolving the current conflict, it is explicitly generating the new conflicts that arise because of the outcome. Playing around with who gets to do that, and to what extent, is a lot of fun for split and no-GM games. <br/><br/><b>Growing It: Creating and Resolving Conflicts Flow Into Each Other</b> <br/><br/>This is something about what Jonathan was talking about with the Generating and Resolving conflicts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ combine it with the morphological elements of Character Choices Rather than Experiences Cause Growth and the Birthing Conflict to get an endless cycle of pushing and pulling to move the game in and out of conflicts that cause conflicts that breed character choices that force conflicts, and so on. I don't want a herky-jerky of new things being introduced because the old things are dead, I want a constant flow of growth and tension.                        </div>

                            A lot of people echoed my own, especially Jonathan regarding playing "set characters" without having to generate dudes. Flip this roleplaying on its ear a little, make it like a modular play/theatre experience; "Dude, last night in our game Romeo totally dropped Juliet to have hot man-love with Tybalt, then together they went all Equilibrium Gun-Fu action up in Mercutio's place!"<br/><br/><b>Creating characters</b><br/><br/>I love a lot of these Japanese RPGs I have where, to make a character, there are like 10-20 "set pieces" (like "classes") that you pick and choose. You choose 2-3 (or "3 levels' worth), and that literally defines just about everything with your character: You abilities, skills, powers, even starting equipment! It's a fast way to get right into the game, the classes are tied to the setting (in one game the classes are actually superpowers: choose two from a list of 10, or double-up in one), and you can find a lot of room for personalization and customizability in the combinations.<br/><br/>With that, any character creation process where you make like 5 choices and your dude is dune, and not only that is ROBUST (ie doesn't just have like 2 stats and that's it). As reflected again in a lot of those Japanese RPGs.<br/><br/>Games where character generation can take less than 2 minutes given the right materials.  Like the "grocery list" of The Roach.<br/><br/><b>Creating situation, setting, and color</b><br/><br/>The Roach: You want to ahve influence over a scene? Fine, spend a point and you're there.  Your character has to be there to contribute. This kind of thing really appeals to me.<br/><br/>The Dream Sheets in Stranger Things, though I worry a little about the reaction of some of my players: "What? There's no MYSTERY here?" But fuck them, they're awesome and I want to explore that kind of thing more.  <br/><br/>Ben's idea for Corpus is grander than grand (search here for Corpus if you haven't seen that stuff). It's a way to contribute crafts (like back in the days of making maps for D&amp;D or lifelike player handouts for CoC) to a game, giving it depth and defining the setting at the same time.<br/><br/><b>Generating and resolving conflicts</b><br/><br/>I'm up there with "not so much turned on by this as by situation/setting/color ideas, rules, mechanics and exploratory/explanatory text".<br/><br/>Though I want to see more visual keys for task/conflict resolution. Game board pieces, Tarot cards, Icehouse pieces, stacking dice on each other, colorful squiggles on your sheet, etc.<br/><br/>A feedback cycle like PTA where the players spend points to get bonuses, but that gives more juice to the GM, to use in more conflicts against you.<br/><br/>Generating: The Mountain Witch's ELIZA system.<br/>GM: "You see a figure approach: Who is it?"<br/>GM: "You come to a message scrawled in the stone wall. What does it say?"<br/><br/><b>Growing characters and situation</b><br/><br/>Not too much in this realm that's totally turning me on that hasn't already been stated. Back in the day I had this "MINDBLOWING!!!" idea where, at the end of the session, character advancement was completely arbitrary between GM and players, but setting advancement had specific rules tied to it (ie how your characters changed the world around them by their actions). I was so amazed by my cleverness of making the "loose story advancement TIGHT", and the "tight character advancement LOOSE", but that was before I found The Forge and started shitting ideas like these for breakfast.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<b>Creating characters</b><br/><br/><br/>Emily's <i>Word-Web</i> from Breaking the Ice. I love the way it puts some limits to freeform trait creation.<br/><i>Thematic Batteries</i>: Really cool stuff. I've begun diceless roleplaying when the first edition of Amber DRPG came out. I like Theatrix a lot, especially because of its Plot Points. Thematic Batteries do away with all the number-crunching, and you still have the cool player empowerment that Plot Points offer. Thematic Batteries. Gotta love 'em.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Creating situation, setting, and color</b><br/><br/><br/><i>Everway</i>'s Vision Cards. Them, and the OK for my players to come up with new plots whenever they like. And the great Elemental Framework by Jon Dobson. And the stuff the Thematic Batteries give you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Generating and resolving conflicts</b><br/>Again, <i>Everway</i> saves my day. Drama, Karma, Fortune, and the <i>Theatrix</i> flowcharts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Growing characters and situation</b><br/>Freeform offers the best possibilities for us here.                        </div>
