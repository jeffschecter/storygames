The producer also hosts, but we split the guest list. I talk about all kinds of things. Economics, Peace and Justice issues, the local farming scene, conserving electricity, parenting groups. In two weeks I'm interviewing the owner of the only comic book store in our county. After that I might interview a local tattoo artist about MRSA and illegal tattoo parlors.

I often ask guests to give me an brief outline of what they do, what they want to talk about. That way I ask them about things I don't know and what I think viewers might want to know, too. Interviewing Meg and Joshua about something I know about was difficult. I had to pretend I didn't know anything about rpg's, or about them. I avoided talking about Steal Away Jordan so that I could still sound objective while obviously talking about something I really enjoy. Plus I would have turned beet red.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>Btw, Julia, since I don't live in your area, I have no idea about it... how many people actually watch this show?  Have you gotten any feedback/interest on the topic now from viewers?</blockquote>\nI don't know how many people watch the show, but we've gotten a fair amount of positive feedback in general about the show. The show started in June and we have a waiting list of about 20 people who want to be on the show, most of whom contacted us about being on.  People have commented that they like learning about what cool things their neighbors do in our town.  People have stopped me on the street after recognizing me from the show. That said, I'm a bit of a townie. I live around the corner from the main drag, I used to work on Main St., and I run a booth at the farmer's market. <br/><br/>The producer/co-host also produced a very popular music show called <a href="http://www.valleyhomegrown.com" rel="nofollow">Homegrown</a>, and I think we get a fair number of viewers who are loyal to him. He's an all-around awesome guy who loves Greenfield, and is committed to local issues: politics, commerce, pride. He's a regular at the farmer's market, which is where I got "discovred". Drew was filming a promo spot for GCTV and asked random people at the farmer's market if they could name the US Supreme Court justices. Apparently I was the only person he asked who could name all of them.* He thought I was photogenic and smart.<br/><br/>Just to give you an idea of the demographics of the area, our town's about 17,000 people, we are the largest city in the county, and the county seat of the farm belt county of Massachusetts. We're now trying to get underwriting funds so we can put together a promotional package to get the show on other public access channels in our area. <br/><br/>*Alito, Souter, Ginsburg, Kennedy, Thomas, Scalia, Roberts (the chief), Breyer, Stevens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105175/#Comment_105175" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T21:50:42+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  9:50PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2007 10:03PM by noclue.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool show Julia. I wonder how it will resonate with non-gamers among the viewers. Its fun watching you holding back smiles as Meg or Joshua are talking about things you know intimately, especially when they talk about your game. My favorite part is when Meg asks if she can out you and you give the immediate "no" without any explanation. You could tell there were a couple times that you were fighting the urge to just start chatting with Meg.<br/><br/>Hey, I have a musician cousin who lives out in Somerville MA. He's pretty <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSbMo6E6-zg" rel="nofollow">good</a> too. That was from Somerville Community Access TV. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYJu3yautaw" rel="nofollow">This one</a> too.

It helped that she did mention it later, even if she made her Obfuscate roll and distracted you from the topic again. Talk show hosts must get a +2 flanking bonus.<br/><br/>I chuckled when Joshua called <i>Steal Away Jordan</i> "deservedly controversial" or some such. I was just waiting for Parthenia to show up. But she kept everything in character.<br/><br/>Julia, I hope you report back any feedback you get from the viewers. I'm very interested in how the show went over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
