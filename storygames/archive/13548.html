While there's no "point" to "winning", you can have a lot of fun basically having your character have horrible and awesome stuff happen to them in equal amounts.<br/><br/>I remember that Matthew at our table was Scheherezade. Her first quest was to get married to his love. Upon completing this quest, the next quest card he picked up was "Now go find the lover that has been haunting your dreams". What a great situation, "Sorry honey, this OTHER guy is my fated guy. Keep the light on." Then on the way to the man of her dreams, she was seduced by an efreet.<br/><br/>Mark's Ali Baba (IIRC, might have been someone else) was struck Insane and Ensorcelled, which meant that other players moved his character around and made decisions for him at random.<br/><br/>My character in the second game went on a DOUBLE HAJJ. Completed one Hajj, only to turn around and do it again.<br/><br/>It really feels like the intersection of an RPG and a boardgame, save for the kind of total randomness of effects of what you do vs the results. But very fun if you like that sort of thing, and can stand playing a very story-oriented game without a focus on "winning". One suggestion though: Keep to 3-4 total players. With 5, the handling becomes a little too much, too much downtime between turns, etc. I might even try a 4-player game with two teams of two characters who alternate, just so all the craziness happens to just two characters in order to see what happens.<br/><br/>Another game I found like this was Betrayal on House on the Hill (aka "Betrayal at the House of the Dead Heroes who Never Win"). The sheer brilliance of the 50-some-odd scenarios and the way the "traitor" is picked makes it feel equal parts role-based and boardgame. However, you won't become as attached to your character-as-person as you will with Tales of the Arabian Nights.<br/><br/>Anyone else play this game?

I recently bought the game and played one match solo and then three more with my friends. It didn't have a speck of roleplaying in it. It's all about resource management and damage control and there is no reason why anyone would ever just "play their character". Even if they do it's pointless because the game wouldn't provide feedback, and other players probably just wouldn't be interested.<br/>I don't think the game even provides any kind of story, beyond the vaguest of arcs. So I'd love to hear from someone else who played and if they had a similar experience.<br/><br/>That said it's a damn good boardgame. It's just very obviously not a rpg.<br/><br/>I think the same goes for HeroQuest. It's got characters and a dungeon and a story and all the trappings of early D&amp;D. But when you play it it's so clearly a boardgame it couldn't be anything else unless you systematically started to throw all the rules away and leave just the characters, their stats and the dice. Trying to roleplay just makes it boring and the story is a railroad anyway.

My friends and I did that sort of on the fly once, and it was great fun. We simply used the board as reference, and played it much in the vein of the video game Dark Corners of the Earth.<br/>I was running it, and used the encounter cards occassionally for inspiration. It felt similar in play to Trail of Cthulhu and Dead of Night, with the very simple dice mechanics, and giving people the clue counters when they actually figured something out meant they had a very tangible idea that they discovered something important. Of course, those were given out sparingly.<br/>I'll have to pow-wow with my friends sometime and write up notes on what exactly we did that made it work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306162/#Comment_306162" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T16:00:16+00:00" title="December 28, 2010  4:00PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>I'll have to pow-wow with my friends sometime and write up notes on what exactly we did that made it work.</blockquote>\nThat would be awesome!<br/><br/>I did muse about taking just the character sheets and the skill checks and running it as a RPG.

I've played it several times as a two player with my wife and it's worked really well.<br/><br/>We only made one change, and oddly it is linked to the question.  We dropped the character names.<br/><br/>The problem was when we started playing, if I had Aladdin and Emma had Scheherazade we felt we should pick skills they'd have and take decisions as they would, which quickly came to clash with the events we encountered.<br/><br/>When we just took a counter and decided on who our guy was ("I'm a scholarly white mage, I'm a beautiful young street thief") it worked much better.<br/><br/>I still wouldn't call it really rpg-like.  It's more that there's a small rpg element in it.  Really it's what the name of this site suggests - it's a story game.  It's a game that generates stories.<br/><br/>One of my boardgaming mates is really keen to play it.  He's also an rpger and mostly on the trad side, but willing (like me really) to try story games - they're just not where his preferences lie.  In trad rpgs though he's all about the story and in-game exploration and all that fun stuff so it's no surprise he's tempted by this.  The more pure boardgamers I could immediately see wouldn't like it because it's not really a game in that sense.<br/><br/>Re Arkham, I love the game but I'd never use it as an rpg.  It has more complex rules than Call of Cthulhu.  Why would I want a clunkier system to run something an existing rpg system already does so well?  It's a great boardgame.  If I want Cthulhoid roleplaying though I play CoC (and if I didn't like CoC I'd play something like Trail which is also less complex than Arkham).<br/><br/>For those who do use it as an rpg though I'd love to hear more about it.  What's folly to me may be brilliance in another after all.

Let's see what can I do... okay, I now I'm wounded and imprisoned." Half an hour passes, repeat. (This was not helped by the fact that one of the other players was off having magical adventures with talking elephants or something while I was stewing with envy in my prison cell, insane and cursed.) <br/><br/>The second time was a little better, as we had sworn never to play with more than three players, to keep everyone "active" as much as possible, but it still felt very random and pointless, and when someone eventually won, we were all just like, "Huh. Okay." No tension, no excitement, just a bunch of things happening one after the other until the end. <br/><br/>While my personal opinion is that the game is miserable, the board and book and color cards and setting are utterly fantastic. I had orders of magnitude more fun just looking over the pieces, and later doing a little pseudo choose-your-own-adventure by flipping through the bits of story in the game book.

So we were always taking part in one way or another, and the game was relatively short. I enjoyed it. An interesting thing that I noticed was that the two other players had wonderful stories about other games they had played: with drama, derring do and amazing turn arounds. <br/><br/>When we played, it was a surprise to me, coming from an rp background, to have all of the story come from the texts. The main choices we have are our responses, which have a subtle (?) effect on the character by giving you a slightly different range of outcomes and rewards. As we played, we overarching stories arise: I was married and so became tethered to my ugly wife, another character rose to vizier and might have become sultan, one suffered all the indiginities of ensorcellement, curses and finally died: then won the game by appearing at Bagdad at a crucial ending moment of the game. But these were all things dictated by the text, and I think they became story through the process of the annotative comments we made in between. They felt more like reading stories than playing them out to me.<br/><br/>But then, when we finished, the other players regaled others with their tales of highs and lows, as though the choices and turns were things they had experience or originated--what I associate with playing an rp. It still strikes me as an odd sort of of way that 2nd or 3rd person narrated art can become a 1st person experience through identification. Like watching a sports game, or movie and feeling the experience having happened to yourself. But in this game you do make choices. It is more like a choose your own adventure, really. One you share with others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306456/#Comment_306456" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T07:58:07+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  7:58AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marc Majcher</cite>"Okay, I'm imprisoned.

The "Hunted by the Vizier" quest. On my third play I pulled this quest at the beginning, and yeah I gotta say that it was downright fucking frustrating. That card is the single thing in the game that can turn someone's interest in it into absolute indifference or hate. That quest has GOT to be Nerfed.<br/><br/>Basically, the quest is "You are accused by a Vizier" (kinda like an Alladin story), "So you wander off for 3 turns. But starting on turn four, you have a (high) chance of being captured and returned to Baghdad. If you have a treasure with you when you return to Baghdad (which /may/ happen if this is the 2nd or 3rd quest you take in the game, but UTTERLY impossible if it's the first quest you pick up), you succeed and gain riches and status, otherwise you are locked in the dungeon and have to escape somehow (usually through the use of various esoteric skills, most of which you simply won't have if this is the first quest you pick up.<br/><br/>...oh, and the dungeon is nigh inescapable. You'll be in it for at least 10 rounds (perhaps an hour of actual play) until you find a way out. Maybe."<br/><br/>I'd houserule to either:<br/><br/>* Remove that quest from the deck entirely. It's just not well thought out, and impossible to resolve.<br/>* If it is drawn as a First or Second Quest, return it to the Bottom of the quest cards and draw again. If it is the third or higher quest, then play as normal.<br/>* If you draw it and end up in prison, on Turn Three you "escape" (perhaps drawing a Fugitive or other status) and discard the quest, drawing another.<br/><br/>I totally understand that in general it is a VERY polarizing game, heck I saw the same effect in my test groups. However, that quest you drew (and me) is just plain borked if you drew it as a starting quest. It looks really story-rich, and is, but it's also broken and frustrating if you haven't had time to build up your character yet.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306497/#Comment_306497" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T18:12:02+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  6:12PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can get yourself crippled in the dungeon, which really racks up your story points.

I want to record the events in the characters' lives next weekend when we play again so that I can think of their tales coherently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
