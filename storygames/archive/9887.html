The RPG I am talking about today is called Intergalactic League of Brawlers... a game seeking to emulate the over-the-top battles and characters of Shonen anime (DBZ, Bleach, Yu-Yu Hakasho, etc...). It has been through several revisions since its inception many years ago...<br/>\n<br/>\n[align=center]Anyways...[/align]<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters in this RPG, called Brawlers, have a Power Level (PLv). Everyone begins the game at PLv 3. PLv is measurement of a Brawler's potential strength... not his current strength. During battle, Brawlers gain what are called Power Stages (PS). PS cannot exceed PLv. PS fluctuates up and down quite a bit throughout a fight. It goes up by spending Ki and goes down by using Techniques. PS makes it easier to gain Ki and also gives cumulative damage bonuses when fighting Brawlers of a lower PS. Ki is gained normally during a Power Up Phase that occurs for all characters every Round. Ki is used for a bunch of things including the aforementioned PS gathering, but also includes damage soak, gaining initiative bonuses and healing.<br/>\n[align=center]As one can tell, the acquisition of PS and the subsequent strategic use of it is key to winning fights.[/align]<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it stands, regardless of a Brawler's PLv... All Brawlers begin a fight at PS 0. The question is, with what little you guys know... I'm wondering if Brawlers should start a battle with a certain PS based on their PLv? My initial thought is yes, thus Brawlers with more potential begin with greater strength. A possible reaction to that would allow Brawlers to begin at a PS equal to 1/2 of their PLv...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Attribute that governs Ki gain is called Soul. I was wondering if a different term would be better? Other candidates I can think of are Spirit and Aura.<br/>\nThe Attribute that governs mid-battle Fighting Spirit* recovery is called Adrenaline. Does that sound appropriate? The only other options I can think of that fit are Resolve.<br/>\n[align=right]* Think Hp with a different flavor[/align]<br/>\nI'm also looking for opinions/suggestions on how Techniques should be handled. To use a Technique the Brawler chooses an amount of PS to spend. For every PS spent, damage capability is temporarily increased. In addition to that you are allowed to choose one Aspect per PS spent. Aspects apply a specific effect such as more damage, better odds of success, status ailments and other such things. Each Brawler has access to a limited number Aspects that he chooses beforehand. The same Aspect may be selected multiple times.<br/>\nDoes the idea of on-the-fly Technique creation for situational strategies sound like it would be fun and functional? For the record, any math involved is pretty simple... Mostly addition/subtraction of blocks of 3 and 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also thinking of implementing an Inspiration system for PC Brawlers that will resembles the Strength/Weakness mechanic in 3:16: CAtS. I love the idea of explaining inspirational flashbacks in order to gain a combat boost. For my game, the effect would be a boost to PS and PLv for the duration of the battle... Inspirations would only usable once per battle, cannot be about the same subject and only when the PC has 20% or less health.<br/>\nSo what do you fellas think? Would such a mechanic fit in with the style of game I am trying to create? I'm thinking it would but I'm unsure.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the inspiration for the game... I want to include an optional format for Structured Play. Structured Play is broken down like so...<br/>\nSeason (overarching storyline) broken up into two or more Story Arcs which contain 3 or more Episodes. Each Story Arc is a major movement towards the completion of the Season. Episodes are broken down by type; Set-Up (establish characters &amp; conflict), Pursue (seek resolution to conflict previously revealed), Finale (resolution of conflict) and Filler (character &amp; setting exploration). Each episode is meant to consume an entire session of play.<br/>\nThis would be used for outlining purposes mainly... though I do want to include a training/battle montage section in the Set-Up or Pursue Episodes. This would simulate those episodes in anime where the characters train to increase their power in order to take on some big bad. So how does this look as a rough outline for structured play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219858/#Comment_219858" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T12:54:20+00:00" title="July 21, 2009 12:54PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, what... am I not in the club, so no one responds in my discussions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219864/#Comment_219864" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T13:05:34+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  1:05PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 1:06PM by Graham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthew, it's so much information, it's difficult to take in.

I know its pathetic that I whined for it, but its lonely at the bottom of the amateur RPG designing world! <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> In any event, I know I'm probably about to throw down yet another TL;DR post but I hope y'all will indulge me once more. Any specific questions regarding the system will likely be met with a full, somewhat detailed answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhiteknife... The thing about PS is that it fluctuates quite a bit throughout a fight. You could have a Brawler go from maximum to 0, back to maximum only to hit 0 again... all within 4 or so rounds of combat which, if my calculations are correct, wouldn't be nearly enough to stop an equally powered Brawler unless things were simply one-sided of course. This is what I think that the decision to give some automatic PS might not be as important as I'm making it out to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I noted below, each Brawler usually has something like 9 Aspects, out of 90, to choose from... I have an additional mechanic I am considering optional at this point called a Master Technique that requires a few specific conditions before it can be used... but it has a unique Aspect associated with it that is actually created by the player instead of chosen from a list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Inspirations... I had a flash of insight regarding that as well... once per session makes a ton more sense. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Matthew, it's so much information, it's difficult to take in.

A lot of these questions have been brewing in my mind for a while now... so I decided to make a massive effort to get them answered. The main problem stems from the fact that I have no playtesters and won't likely gain any soon. =(<br/>\n<br/>\nMy vision for this game came from an old homebrew I had created when I was 13, shortly after DBZ debuted on Toonami. Its combat mechanics slowly gathered entertaining depth over 5 years of play and revision yet a lot of the fun <b>we had</b> came from simply painting the actions being taken with the most absurd colors our bizarre minds could drum up at that age. Then my only copy of that game was permanently and irrevocably erased. This is basically my quest to reacquire the <i>feel</i> of that game, rather than its exact mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want the combat mechanics to be one of the main Fun drives while requiring some strategy*... but I want narration of maneuvers to <i>really</i> matter. I didn't explain in my original post the absolute importance of coloring the world with detail... but it is, in my mind, the most important aspect even though the section covering it is a mere 3 paragraphs.<br/>\n[align=right]*The core strategy in this game is, How much of a gamble will it take to win?[/align]<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Matthew, don't let anyone piss on your fire.

I never really thought about publishing the end product of what I'm creating. I've always viewed it as a personal journey more than anything... because of the previously mentioned lack of playtesters, I never know where the quality of my game lies so I don't know if it will ever get published.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you say, I do in fact have the exact mechanics worked out. The game is playable by my standards though it doesn't have that professional polish, formatting or much of a setting. The selection of terms is important to me because I'm trying to evoke a feeling/mood. Words carry quite a bit of power in a game where strategic depth can come from an action with a well-described advantage built into it. I'd like to note that I am replacing Soul with Aura, "officially."<br/>\n<br/>\nLike the importance of colorful detail, it didn't occur to me that mentioning what makes Brawlers different would be important. First of all, the six Attributes differ as they are all rated anywhere from 3 ~ 7 (on average); Adrenaline, Power, Speed, Offense, Defense and Aura. Second, there are the Aspect choices. 90 are available as of right now. Brawlers usually have access to no more than 9, usually. Third, Power Source.<br/>\n<b>Power Sources</b> are the meat and potatoes of your narration color... Thus, a guy with the ability to grow giant plants in an instant and control them will fight much differently than the guy whose rage manifests itself as lava-like projectiles. Power Sources aren't specifically Techniques, they are what your Brawler <i>does</i>. Every time your Brawler attacks, you can come up with a new and interesting way to use your Power Source... get really creative, perhaps describing how your Power Source is <i>more effective</i> against your opponent's, and the GM is encouraged to hand out bonuses for your rolls.<br/>\nThat said, the Power Source a Brawler has is completely dependent on the player whom created him. No preset lists, only examples/suggestions. Think of Power Source as my game's single PDQ-like quality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219918/#Comment_219918" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T14:48:43+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  2:48PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For sure.

This game is ideal for a small, smaaall crowd. No bigger than two players and a GM. I want the folks involved to be trying their best to 'wow' one another through amazing descriptions. I always think about the fantastically weird things me and my main RPG buddy would come up with... From what I recall, a lot of the fun spawns from the absurdity of the massive power scale and the incredibly over the top things the player do with it. I had one guy who wanted to wield a light saber, for some reason... I came up with a special ability for him where he would thrust his weapon skyward and yell out, "Perpetual Beam Tower!" (all campy, attack naming style!!!) and his weapon would extend and grow as wide as he wished before striking forward. Planets were cut in twain, I assure you.<br/>\nThe only dice used are d20 and d6... I'm thinking of cutting the six-sided die though. Character sheets don't get any modifications during the game, since lots of erasing goes on... I have a Player Record Sheet for all of that. I'd really like to use tokens but the amount of Ki that flies around is somewhat absurd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid" title="HiQKid"><img alt="HiQKid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid">HiQKid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219964/#Comment_219964" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T17:17:18+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  5:17PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 5:18PM by HiQKid.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MacLeod</cite> You know, a combat example is one of things I haven't finished yet.

Maybe the aspect could increase the minimum damage so you have better control of how much damage the attack does.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nMyself\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I agree that Techniques are pretty limited in the beginning. That is what I'm going for actually. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> Think of Yusuke from YuYu Hakusho, he can only fire his Spirit Gun once a day when he starts out! In any event, while the game is suppose to have some strategic mechanical depth, a lot of the action and excitement stems from lots and lots of color.<br/>\n<br/>\nPLv is a slow progression as a default. However, in the text I urge GMs to progress PLv at whatever rate he feels works. The problem as of right now is that I don't have any play testing done so I'm not sure if players are going to need to feel rewarded with rapid PLv gain. My hope is that rapid PLv gain won't be necessary...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some alternate PLv mechanic that operates as a Death Spiral with a semi-static PLv. Basically, your PLv equals the tens digit of your Fighting Spirit (which is 100 for everyone) with 100 counting as 10. Thus, as one's FISP is lowered via damage, Brawlers lose their potential (PLv) and may even lose strength (PS lowering because PLv became too low)... I mentioned it before but the Adrenaline Attribute is used mid-battle to restore FISP.<br/>\nI think this method would work pretty well for games that want to avoid power creep. I set it as an alternate method because Shonen games are infamous for insane power creep. =D<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ki gain mechanic is a dice pool... the only dice pool mechanic in the game, everything else runs on a unified mechanic. So, folks have a Soul rating... usually a value anywhere from 3 to 7... And this rating determines how many d6 you roll during the Power Up Phase. Every success, being 4 ~ 6, scores that Brawler 1 Ki. The GM is encouraged to fudge his own roll and simply assign a Ki value that is "reasonable" for enemies. Each PS applies a +1 Soul. I'm already seeing a potential problem with super high Soul values, so I'm planning on allowing anything above 10 to count as an automatic +1 Ki.<br/>\nEach PS requires double its value in Ki to acquire. Thus, PS 1 cost 2 Ki while PS 52 cost 104 Ki. I did this so that even though you are gaining a lot more Ki as you gain PS, its not nearly enough to cover the spread and make higher PS really easy to acquire.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS only increases damage if you have a higher PS than the opponent. PS spent on (lost to) a Technique increases damage regardless and often at a higher rate. Choosing a damage boosting Aspect then further increases damage. However, I should note that these bonuses are merely towards damage potential.<br/>\nEveryone has Power Attribute, rated from 3 ~ 7, that is multiplied by a value called Damage Factor, which is rated anywhere from 1 ~ 5 depending on the result of the attack (attack and damage result in a single die roll). Thus, Pow bonuses can be greatly helpful or only slightly beneficial.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid" title="HiQKid"><img alt="HiQKid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid">HiQKid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220008/#Comment_220008" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T22:37:55+00:00" title="July 21, 2009 10:37PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 10:38PM by HiQKid.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gonna be honest here; there are a few things I'm shaky on here.<br><br>I really don't like the alternate death spiral rule. It basically says that "You're losing, so lose more!".<br>Similarly, the way PS gains through Ki then increase Soul (and thus more Ki)... it smells a bit too much like "You're winning, so win more!".

I don't like that much. Either have him roll above-board or have him determine Ki via some other method (maybe he has a pool of points to spend per fight or per session), or there should be some flat increase, or some such. But just arbitrarily assigning a Ki - and with the now-useless ritual of "rolling dice" - bothers me.<br><br>But some of these things might be kind of personal preference, and the rest of it looks off to a good start.

I included out of the shallow hope that I might one day finish it and distribute the game to others... I know lots of people prefer death spirals so as a simple alternate rule, I can't help but think it won't hurt to include it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Soul (or, Aura as it shall be known from hence forth) bonus for PS exists to tempt the player into keeping his PS as high as possible. As I mentioned before, PS is often spent with the intention of launching a huge attack. Due to Adrenaline as a constant source of healing, the best way for a Brawler to defeat his foe is by making a huge attack. Sure, a bad collection of rolls can mean the end of anyone but generally speaking... Techniques are key in dominating an opponent. Similarly, knocking your PS down too far will make you vulnerable... so its a shaky balance that favors neither all-out gamblers or tight-ass conservatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo expand a bit on my reasoning above... the Aura bonus makes each PS worth two things; +1 Power and +1 Aura. However, the Power bonus is easily canceled out by the PS of a similarly stronger Brawler... This means, to draw out that power the Brawler <i>must</i> perform a Technique. Each PS used for a Tech automatically nets that Brawler +2 Power, which can translate anywhere from +2 damage to +10 damage if he hits (keep in mind that Brawlers have 100 Fighting Spirit).<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">That and the "GM is encouraged to fudge his roll and assign a Ki value"... I don't like that much.</div>\n</blockquote>\nIts a simple encouragement, and as such is 100% possible to ignore. The thing is, if there are two Players and the GM is controlling 2 foes... he may have to roll 20 dice. 10 dice for a single person is okay, though in my opinion is pushing the limits of patience... but 20 dice? No thanks. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> And its the GM! He isn't running a competition against the players. His role isn't to destroy the PCs, its to challenge them to top their last heroic and awesome description. To that effect, I personally would simply select a Ki gain that breeds the sort of tension I would want for the situation at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said... The only mechanical aspect I have any true misgivings about as of this moment is the Ki gain dice pool. I've been playing around with the idea of just making it a solid value... meaning, current Aura = Ki gain for that Round.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure how this would impact the game as a whole... but it moves it towards a more diceless style. The d20 would then be the sole die used. Which reminds me, the game uses one of two tables (skill or combat) to determine the outcome of an action rolled. For instance, a character making an attack (which are called Clashes, for some reason) adds his Offense stat to his roll... then the opponent subtracts his Defense... the total is then compared against the Clash Resolution table. Just like Talislanta. =D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220022/#Comment_220022" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T00:57:15+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 12:57AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [align=center]Somewhat of a random tangent...[/align]<br/>\nFor the record, if ILoB sounds like it is going to be a laundry list of difficulty and crunch... the actual rules only come out to cover something close to 6 pages, 10 pt font with 1" margins.

His target, a deadly creature capable of summoning spirits to do his bidding, was rumored to have past by this part of the galaxy little less than three days ago. Upon hearing the emergency transmission from this small planet, Dolan knew he would find him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(GM)</b> Your search has taken you to what you gather was the poor side of this town. It is composed primarily of wide streets, apartment complexes and seemingly abandoned cars. No corpses, in fact, no evidence of people at all beyond the remnants of civilization. A curl of flame rolls off of Ifrit\u2019s scabbard before his deep voice begins to resonate within your mind, \u201cHe is here, boy. The spirit ridden one. Draw me and I will show you!\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(Player)</b> I let my gaze fall upon the buildings around me as I reply to the sealed god, \u201cNo, Ifrit. You would do more harm than good, I\u2019m sure. Plus, we don\u2019t know if people remain.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(GM)</b> You can feel a sudden tension permeating the air\u2026 You know this keen sense of danger is result of your time spent with Ifrit, and as such is impossible to ignore. Ifrit\u2019s voice rumbles once again, \u201cI can assure you, boy, the people in this town have long since passed away.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(Player)</b> I let concern wash over my face before saying, \u201cLong since passed away? How long exactly?\u201d I don\u2019t even notice as my trembling hand slowly creeps behind my back, gripping the hilt of my sword.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(GM)</b> Before Ifrit can respond, a manhole bursts open a few feet in front of your face with a loud ringing sound. The concrete surrounding the hole cracks and falls away. A pale figure rises from the sewer, spasms wracking his body. Strange tattoos of a design unknown to you cover many inches of his body, all colored blood red. His orange hair sways in the wind yet covers his eyes completely, he is now suspended several feet high in the air before you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(Player)</b> I call upon Ifrit, a flame crawls from my scabbard before swirling around my right arm. I say to the fiend, \u201cYoguna! I have come here to put you to death. Your crimes are irredeemable and I have been given the authority to destroy you. Surrender and your end will be quick and painless!\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(GM)</b> Yoguna\u2019s head begins to shake in disagreement, first slowly\u2026 then violently fast. He grits his teeth, you can hear a muffled scream emanating from him that seems to only be getting louder as if in sync with the violent shaking of his head.

This is called a Clash Check. Before rolling the die, both the GM and the Player are given the option to perform a Technique. Neither is inclined to accept the option yet. The GM rolls 1d20 and gets an 10. This value is increased by Yoguna\u2019s Offense attribute, which is 7 for a total of 17. This value is then reduced by Dolan\u2019s Defense which is 4 for a grand total of 13. Looking at the Clash Resolution chart, this is a Damage Factor 4 hit. Every attack achieves some kind of success. To determine damage, the attacker\u2019s Power attribute is multiplied by [DF]. Yoguna has 4 [Pow]. Brawlers can gain [Pow] bonuses if they have a higher [PS] than their opponent. However, his [PS] is equal to Dolan\u2019s thus he receives no [Pow] bonus. In other words, 4x4=16 damage. Damage reduces Fighting Spirit, this means that Dolan now has 84 [FISP] instead of 100. Damage is not necessarily wounds, remember [FISP] can be lowered simply by denying the opponent the ability to feel effective! In addition to dealing damage, Clashes reduce [IR] by the [DF] value.

This makes the game a lot clearer in my mind.<br><br>Overall, it looks like a lot of fun!  There's a bunch of math to learn here, but by the end of the example, I felt I could actually play the basics (roll to hit, add/subtract, check chart, spend ki, etc.), so that's excellent.  In fact, it looks fluent enough to be ready for thorough playtesting.  And this will need a LOT of playtesting.  Games that are this crunchy need to be balanced enough to remain enjoyable over time.<br><br>For example, our hero uses his special ability late in the fight.  Why not earlier?  The effect would have been the same, he would have had an early advantage, and it would have cost less; after all, going down from PS 2 to PS1 is made up with expending 4 ki, but if your ability takes you down from PS 5 to PS 4, you need to spend 10 ki to get back up to PS 5.  That seems to me to encourage early use of abilities rather than building up to them as finishing moves or the likes.  Your initial post said that you could spend additional PS for more effects, so that could take care of this issue if that's still the case.  The additional effects would just have to be worth quite a bit; otherwise, I'll just go from PS 1 to PS 2 each round and use my Technique every time.  The expense of ki is another one to watch out for... as healing can undo, in some cases, more damage than the character took last turn, which can be frustrating.<br><br>Also... games where the narration is pure color can sometimes lose the narration over time.  I designed a game once in which players fought each other with evil minions in character battles.  As in your example, the way we described attacks was purely for fun, there was no effect that came out of it.  Playtesting showed that people stopped narrating much of their actions and just went to rolling the dice.  That may or may not happen much with your game, but it's always a risk when there's crunch to worry about, and no effect comes from whether you narrate creative actions or just "I punch him in the nose."  Having a GM in your game can fix this, if the GM leads with good examples and keeps that narrative interest up; you may want to have GM advice to that effect in the game.<br><br>So, good luck with your playtesting, and keep us updated on your progress! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222665/#Comment_222665" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T07:26:30+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  7:26AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the comments, Christian. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely agree about the playtesting bit, I just have to find some willing folks and I'm set. =D I did send the document to the guy I use to play with in high school, he plans on running it with some folks over in North Carolina... so here is hoping that he actually does it.<br/>\nOne of the things I am looking forward to is hammering out the Technique Aspects. When I set the numbers for those, I really had no idea what to expect... ... ...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to think that while a lot of math flies around during combat, its the kind that once you start doing it for a little bit... it becomes nearly second-nature. At least, that is my experience with math... well... as long as it is addition/subtraction and multiplication. Division is for the birds, in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I wrote up the example of play, I wanted a big finish to make it cinematic. Also, the thing with using Techniques earlier is that doing so <i>will</i> give your opponent a Power bonus if he is continually sustaining his own Power Stage instead of responding with his own Techniques. This <i>should</i> mean that the best opportunity to unleash a big Technique is about half way through the fight because your opponent will either have to respond accordingly or risk taking massive damage with no recourse... which effectively sets him up for his death. At least, this was the intention of the game mechanics.<br/>\nI have since changed the Power Stage cost to be equal to the next Power Stage's value. <b>IE:</b> PS 4 cost 4 Ki, PS 23432 cost 23432 Ki, etc... The Aura bonus for every Power Stage is still intact so adding a Power Stage every Round is not only possible but expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice in Action Phase 5 that Yoguna uses four Power Stages to activate a Technique. For each Power Stage used in this way the player may choose one Aspect. I didn't want to get too fancy in the example of play so I just used the standard Power Aspect for all four Power Stages (each instance of which provides a +2 Pow).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear ya on the Ki healing portion. Based on playtesting I may cap the amount of Ki usable for healing per Round. My initial thoughts are to cap it either at Power Stage or at double Power Stage, though I'm not sure if it is a problem yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout narrative color... I know where you are coming from in that regard. Its one of the reasons why in the text regarding color that I insist on the GM providing incentives for creativity. In the end, creativity may be the great equalizer that allows PCs to win against otherwise perfectly equal opponents. In a way, creativity may represent a hero's will and destiny.<br/>\nThe other thing is... if this game ends up playing to my grand vision of the past, combat will be the main attraction mechanically but will the occurrences of which will be rare. Well, not <b>too</b> rare. At least one or two a session depending on what kind of campaign is being run.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully I will be able to muster up a playtest of my own before the year ends... or at least my pal delivers me a report on his own experience with the system. If I'm lucky, and I'm not usually, he'll even provide me with enough information to report an Actual Play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222678/#Comment_222678" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T08:26:53+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  8:26AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well good luck with playtesting.
