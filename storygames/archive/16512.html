I've been to a lot of other major conventions and know the general rigmarole, but know zero DexCon-specific lore.<br/><br/>Two questions, one directed and one open-ended:<br/><br/>1) How/when do we sign ourselves up for specific events to make sure we get to play in the LARPs we want to play in?<br/>2) What general golden advice specific to DexCon would you impart to help us maximize our fun?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378266/#Comment_378266" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T13:16:08+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  1:16PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can answer question 1: you sign up for stuff after the schedule goes up by sending an email to the convention staff with the games you'd like to sign up for in it. They will post the address (and the schedule) at a later date.<br/><br/>DexCon is partly about the atmosphere! On Fridays, there's an informal black tie night. So if you want to participate, pack some duds. Also, the larp costumes tend to run the gamut from normal clothing to elaborate. Personally, I'd err on the side of elaborate (or at least well-thought-out)<br/><br/>I am running some freeform games, to which you're heartily invited.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jennisodes" title="Jennisodes"><img alt="Jennisodes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jennisodes">Jennisodes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378299/#Comment_378299" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T16:34:08+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  4:34PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi,<br/>If you are interested in running 3 or more games as an Indie GM you can fill out this <a href="http://dexcon2012ige.wufoo.com/forms/gm-proposal-indie-game-explosion-dexcon-2012/" rel="nofollow">IGE form</a> or contact me at jennifew@gmail.com.

For anyone kind enough to answer, my questions are around logistics:<br/><br/>I have to make it to Chicago by the Saturday/latest Sunday a.m., which cuts into the con some. I'm trying to figure out if jumping to the con for 2-3 days and then schlepping it to a hub (newark?) is creating a lot of crazy stress for myself, especially considering I don't drive and blithely assume that every country has a decent mass transit system.<br/><br/>Do people tend to stay at the convention hotel itself? Is it a wise idea to find room-mates ahead of time, or just plump for a single room?<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378389/#Comment_378389" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T07:30:48+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  7:30AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's easy to get to Newark from Morristown by train.<br/><br/>And yes, people generally stay at the con hotel, and split their rooming cost with other con-goers. (I am unavailable for such this time out, for reasons I'll detail in a later post.)<br/><br/>My general advice regarding sign-ups is: pre-register, and then the *instant* the schedule goes up, send in your game preferences for each time slot. Give a 2nd and even 3rd choice for each time-slot, to maximize your chances of getting into games you want. Also\u2014I made this mistake last time\u2014don't send in your preferences to the email from which Vinny announces the schedule is up Send it to the email address listed on the site above the schedule itself.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378418/#Comment_378418" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T08:59:46+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  8:59AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the info, all! <br/><br/>Lizzie, we also err on the side of elaborate costuming, and we love freeform LARP, so consider us heartily interested!<br/><br/>Jennifer, I've got no idea what our schedule will be like, and with first con and other logistic deals, I'm not comfortable with committing to running multiple games.
