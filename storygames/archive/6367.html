I've had the conversation many, many times since, and still can't find a solution to the metagaming aspect of "puzzle" games.<br/><br/>The basic situation is puzzles, enigmas, traps, riddles... they're metagame by nature.<br/><br/>I designed several puzzle dungeon crawls, myself, back in the day; and even then would always feel bad if the *players* couldn't figure out the puzzles, or even if they were too easy, etc. Maybe I hadn't given them the clues correctly... maybe they just weren't clever enough... maybe the gimmick was flawed to begin with. Whatever the case, it just never felt right to make it so the *players* had to figure out a particular puzzle. After all, I didn't make them stand up and kill something IRL during combat, or *really* convince *me* when trying to lie to an NPC, etc. Nor did it feel right to just make them roll and tell them "The answer to the riddle is 'an egg.'" I've even tried various combinations which all turned out to be basically, "If the players can't figure it out, allow them some kind of roll." This usually lead to a lot of player dissatisfaction.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm kind of thinking that traps and riddles, etc. shouldn't even be designed for a role-playing scenario. Or, at least, not in a built-in way. I'm considering having a list of various clever things (puzzle traps *and* riddles) to have on hand. Then, in the design of a scenario writing something along the lines of "Deadly trap with a difficulty of N goes here," or "Gollum asks them a riddle." If they succeed, just kind of play it out with them in a more descriptive way like combat: (player gets a highly successful roll) "His riddle is easy. Your Gran used to full the neighborhood children with that one" then have the player just roll play a random answer. Or in the case of a puzzle trap, "Oh... the designer of this must have been a mad genius, you can see that through a complicated set of ropes and pulleys, one must actually brace one rope and cut another." The list of "really clever things" could be used for inspiration or when not feeling terribly improv-creative to add details to the RP.<br/><br/>So, what are other things people have tried before? What are things that have worked for you, or have "felt right" and have given the players a satisfying experience without insulting their intelligence?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25" title="vertigo25"><img alt="vertigo25" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://vertigo25.com/junk/supesavatar-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25">vertigo25</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140871/#Comment_140871" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T23:10:25+00:00" title="April 22, 2008 11:10PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2008 7:50AM by vertigo25.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<del>And damnit I wish I could edit the title of this post.</del><br/><br/><del>Seriously, I know it's "your."

It's a puzzle. You can fiddle with it for hours. Or you can chop it in half with your sword. Either way, something interesting happens, and your reputation changes as a result. <br/><br/>I don't enjoy situations where there's a single answer that the players must figure out. It's more fun for me if I put them in a dungeon with a deathtrap that has a solution, and I then leave them to decide what to do:<br/>1. Try to solve the puzzle, which they might just be in the mood for;<br/>2. Push some buttons at random and then fight the monsters that appear, which is more likely; <br/>3. Exit the dungeon, and go find the broken-down old man who built the deathtrap, decades ago. Buy him some booze, talk it up. Get the answer from him. Turns out he used to be the Emperor's Master Clocksmith, but was exiled in disgrace after a scandal. Hired by some deranged priest, and tasked with creating a bunch of puzzle-traps to keep people out of the tomb. The players promise him ten percent of the haul, then they go back and "solve" the puzzle. <br/><br/>Same thing goes for the riddle: "You meet an old witch. She gives you a cryptic riddle. What do you do?" My players will:<br/>1. Try to solve it (maybe);<br/>2. Try to bribe her (possibly);<br/>3. Attack (probably).<br/><br/>You could probably come up with a few more options, but you get the idea. Players love finding solutions to problems (at least, mine do), but it sucks when you get the feeling that there's only one "right" answer to a problem, regardless of what kind it is. So I always create problems with multiple solutions, knowing full well that they're going to come up with something I would never have thought of.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25" title="vertigo25"><img alt="vertigo25" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://vertigo25.com/junk/supesavatar-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25">vertigo25</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140873/#Comment_140873" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T23:28:05+00:00" title="April 22, 2008 11:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gothca. Good points, really. I definitely agree with that; and would, of course, give them those options. I'm thinking more about the specific details given to the players in the situation:<br/><br/>"The room is filled with a tangled mess of ropes and pulleys. From the ceiling you can see what appear to be sharp knives dangling from the ends of the ropes..."<br/><br/>Usually results in players asking questions along the lines of "Can I see any switches or any plates in the floor?" or calling actions of "I try to trace one of the ropes from the beginning to the end..."<br/><br/>In other words, if they're interested in solving the puzzle, their minds go directly to working it out.

Don't look at it in terms of character immersion or roleplaying; look at it as player critical thinking challenges -- the riddle is as much a challenge for the players' brains as any combat set piece where they decide which move to take and which spell to cast.  It's all about figuring out the best solution in a situation, and for that goal there must be a best solution and inoperable solutions, or else there's no thrill in figuring out the right one.  Now, <em>if your players are digging on this stuff</em>, then presenting them with challenges, tactics-based or riddle-based, is the way to go.  If your players want to immerse in character and really feel what Starbreeze Forestsong feels as she goes about looting goblin corpses, then the riddles are irrelevant, and should be dropped or handwaved ("There is a riddle about a duck.").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140907/#Comment_140907" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T07:05:12+00:00" title="April 23, 2008  7:05AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2008 7:11AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, good old \u201cshould it address the players or the characters?\u201d problem <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The least bad solution I found till know is: leave them the choice.

As Josh implies, simply don't tell the riddle. If you tell a riddle, immediately a player can't help but consider it a personal challenge. And he'll be sorely tempted to have his character know what he knows... even if this is totally implausible. That's bad. You've not only changed the player's creative agenda, but thrown them into Pawn Stance specifically.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresent the contest involved up front:<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "He asks a riddle, and it's hard enough to be difficulty 4."<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you've determined if the character has won the contest, then, if you like, present the riddle to the player. As a fun side-diversion. The player understands that his character's success or failure has already been determined, and that his own success or failure is meaningless to that. It's just some fun on the side. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do it in the reverse, having the roll after the player fails, then you're saying, "Well, you're not that smart, so we'll let you get bailed out by your character." And, yeah, that's just confusing in terms of creative agenda, etc. And perhaps demeaning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPut another way... let's say that a player makes a mistake in maneuvering his character in very tactical play... do we then allow the character a tactics roll to have made the better decision? No, that would totally drain the fun out of making the decisions for yourself, and having the rewards be directly related to how well you performed as a player. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe related subject here is the old "Do I let social skills resolve situations, or do I play out social encounters and see how they go?" The worry that people have is that if you allow character social skills to be used to resolve situations, that players will just ask for rolls, and not role-play out their character's dialog. If you're interested in getting that "role-play" out of players, you can still use social skills. Simply have them narrate the dialog until it becomes clear that there's an impasse in the discussion, and what's at stake becomes clear. Then move to the dice. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the player can't narrate why his character was so convincing, then simply narrate, "Your character speaks in his usual eloquent fashion, and soon the barkeep spills what he knows about the guild." That's fine narration, and authors use it all the time. It's more important to explore the character, and how he handles things, than it is to do first person narration in most cases. Could be my own personal bias, but I feel that the latter is over-rated, and sought because most people assume it's the only way to get players to make interesting revelations about their characters. In point of fact, there are others. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140911/#Comment_140911" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T07:30:57+00:00" title="April 23, 2008  7:30AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I get you.

It depends on the gaming groups  tastes / expectations ( / social contract ?). I consider that the enigma, or the trap (or the battle strategy, or the political cunning, or the fast-talk, \u2026) that address the player are mini-games. Go to gamist-land for a short time. Allowing players the choices between solve and roll (try to solve it and roll when you don't want to try anymore) allow the player to choose whether he changes or not his creative agenda for a while.<br/><br/>(As for the stance, wasn\u2019t it you that wrote <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6054" rel="nofollow"> \u201cPedantic Methods for Obtaining Author Stance\u201d</a>? Is Author Stance &gt; Pawn stance?)<br/><br/><br/>For my part I mostly welcome these shorts breaks from sim/narr play (I still don't know exactly where I am) and when I don't, I simply\u2026 er\u2026 how to tell that\u2026 use \u201creversed Force\u201d? I don\u2019t wait for the GM (although I would wait for other players having fun solving the enigma): I roll for my character and narrate the result (eg \u201cObviously Gaspard can't even understand the enigma.\u201d), end of story. (And, BTW, I always add my little codicil to the social contract \u201cI, the player, will never play chess for any of my characters\u201d.)<br/><br/>That's bad as long as the mini-game bothers the players rather than amuse them. Last time I ran an enigma, which was by no way mandatory, the players tried for maybe twenty minutes, then one of them got tired and rolled. His main character solved the enigma, and we came back to the main game. The players all returned to the enigma after the game. Everybody had his fun.<br/><br/>Enigmas can change the creative agenda and stance in any media. In a book, when the character is presented with an enigma, the reader is offered the chance to change is attitude [stance ? creative agenda ?] from audience to &lt; ? &gt; [gamism ? competition with the character ?]. He may try to solve the enigma on his own, or he may simply continue to read and see the answer. Some readers enjoy \u2014 and, hence, do \u2014 the first, others prefer the later.<br/><br/>[Only after writing this do I realize that I reproduced this scheme with my gaming procedure.]<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Once you've determined if the character has won the contest, then, if you like, present the riddle to the player.

I wonder if (what follows is pure speculation) this could not be because you won\u2019t enjoy having your creative agenda disturbed so, as a GM, you remove this possibility of change? The same way I would never propose to any of my players to play a game of chess inside a rpg session \u2014 because I won\u2019t enjoy playing the opponent, nor watching the chess game if another player took this role.

No, that would totally drain the fun out of making the decisions for yourself, and having the rewards be directly related to how well you performed as a player.</blockquote>The tactical play example is a much more difficult one (note that I am <i>not</i> saying that it is irrelevant), mainly because changes in the shared fiction are committed moment to moment and you would have to rollback to allow the character to take over the player. And, yes, moment by moment, before committing the changes to the shared fiction, I sometime do roll (or ask for a roll) if a player wants a character to do something the character probably wouldn\u2019t (a too big mistake, a unforgettable knowledge missing, or, depending on the game, a blaring personality incoherence). If the roll is successful, we discuss of some things the character would rather do and the player chooses. This \u201csolves\u201d the problem of things the character probably wouldn\u2019t do. If it is something the character definitively wouldn\u2019t do, we just discuss (no roll needed). It\u2019s not much different from players discussing options when the character obviously wouldn\u2019t.<br/><br/>Also, I note that you do not in this case advise to tell the player \u201cYou prepare your troops and see it\u2019s going to be a very tactical battle. It\u2019s hard enough to be a difficulty 4\u201d and then, once it is determined whether the character has won the contest, if you like, present the tactical situation to the player, as a fun side diversion.<br/><br/>At this point I really start to wonder whether I read you correctly. Are tactical challenges akin or different to enigmas? Are you proposing multiple, opposed solutions?<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>The related subject here is the old "Do I let social skills resolve situations, or do I play out social encounters and see how they go?" The worry that people have is that if you allow character social skills to be used to resolve situations, that players will just ask for rolls, and not role-play out their character's dialog. If you're interested in getting that "role-play" out of players, you can still use social skills. Simply have them narrate the dialog until it becomes clear that there's an impasse in the discussion, and what's at stake becomes clear. Then move to the dice.</blockquote>That is still another option. Overall, for any challenge, you can address the player, the character or try to reconcile the two, depending on what you enjoy. Is that what you meant to illustrate?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141046/#Comment_141046" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T06:44:48+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  6:44AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few things, Ajax...<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, my "that's bad" comment is in the context of an assumption about mode of play. An almost tautological one, actually. Basically if you're playing some mode outside of gamism (what I called "non-competitive play"), including gamism opportunities is bad. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf, in fact, player challenge is what play is all about, as I tried to indicate later, then riddles to the player are great, and you shouldn't dilute the reward cycle for the gamism by giving a simulative out. The player lost, he wants to feel that loss. Else he wouldn't be playing that way. If you ameliorate the loss, then you're basically saying that it doesn't matter how well the player does. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for "mini-games" that's just fine. One could argue that the combat in TROS is a "mini-game" involving alot of gamism inside of the overall more narrativism oriented play. It's fine to "shift" between modes like this, so long as players aren't sent mixed messages. And riddles in otherwise simulative play, or sim amelioration of player challenge failure, is a distinctly mixed message. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm using GNS modes as an example. Again there's also issues with stance and other creative agenda dissociations that can occur from mixing up how resolution occurs. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I run games these days, I make sure that it's quite clear that there is absolutely nothing that a player can do to increase his character's chances of winning contests. Yes, he can choose to have his character take on challenges that are easier or harder, but that has thematic output (especially if there's no challenge to getting the contest you want). In contests themselves, the player's role is, at most, to define how his character interacts with the challenge, which may increase his chances of winning, but only as a reward for participating in the simulation. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking of Hero Quest play, in particular. The player does create a higher chance of his character succeeding by indicating all of the abilties that pertain to the contest. But there's no challenge here, and the player is rewarded for doing this "accurately" or "entertainingly" and losing contests is not a punishment. So we have play where the reward cycles are not promoting gamism. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as you put any challenge in front of a player, it's a near automatic switch in mode. Especially for competitive people like myself, yes, but I see this everywhere. Don't do it, unless competition is what you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141068/#Comment_141068" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T08:34:20+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  8:34AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Mike</b>,<br/><br/>Thanks for the kind elucidations.<br/><br/>I must be particularly dense today, because I still can't get what you're saying <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> Or I don't understand the terminology correctly.

I definitely appreciate Mike Holmes\u2019 advice to keep in mind the effect of riddles etc. on creative agenda.   One other factor I\u2019ll throw into the mix is that the game is about everyone\u2019s fun\u2014including the GM.  I like certain types of puzzles, therefore I like to insert puzzles into games I run.  But I recognize the danger Mike and others have talked about where introduction of a puzzle could derail the game if the players can\u2019t solve it; ruin immersion; and potentially be unsatisfying.<br/>So, in line with the request at the start of the thread, here are some of the things I\u2019ve done to introduce puzzles in a way that both I and the players (I hope) enjoy.  These ideas are not unique to me!  <br/><br/>A player-solved puzzle has an in-game alternative.  Ex:  an interlocking key puzzle needed to unlock a prisoner\u2019s cell can be obviated by a \u2018knock\u2019 spell on the cell door, lockpicking, or bending the bars.  In play, a player spent about 10 seconds fiddling with the keys and then used magic.   <br/><br/>Use of props.  Ex:  a courier carries two letters, both of which are written out on paper, which are then rolled up as scrolls as props.  The first copy is magically trapped to ignite if read by anyone other than the intended recipient unless the trap is dispelled.  The text is in the clear.  The second letter has a concealed message in what otherwise looks to be a normal correspondence, and is otherwise untrapped.  The concealed message in the second letter is the \u2018in the clear\u2019 text of the first letter.  In play, the players excitedly unrolled the first message without taking any precautions.  It burst into flame.  They circumspectly opened the second, and were at first dismayed to find it unhelpful.  One player, however, quickly realized the key and translated the message, while the other characters pursued other investigations.      <br/><br/>Player-solved puzzles have handouts to reflect completing each step in solving the puzzle.  The difficulty in solving some puzzles in game is the sheer time involved, and the possibility of making errors.  Creating handouts reduces these problems.  Ex:  for an enciphered message, I usually have a handout with the frequency of the letters in the message.  I give this to the players as soon as they start counting the letters or even as soon as someone suggests counting\u2014because obviously they are correctly guessing that the message is a simple single substitution.  And I purposely build the original message so that the most common English letters are the most common.  The handout lets them know they are on the right track, saves time, and limits the chance that a counting error will throw off the solution.  And, of course, the solved message has a handout as well.      <br/><br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141309/#Comment_141309" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T12:28:45+00:00" title="April 25, 2008 12:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty cool. If the player realizes that his character has the other ability (one might want to mention it), then a player giving up on using his wits is being penalized by using the in-game resource as his out. This way you maintain the player challenge, but allow for the character effectiveness to kick in without ameliorating the loss. <br/>\n<br/>\nNice. Might be hard to always come up with such tricks and traps, but it's a paradigm to attempt at least. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
