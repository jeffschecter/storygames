                    Over on <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21819.0" rel="nofollow">the Forge</a> I started a thread about an idea had for character creation in my dystopian game, Yesterday's Tomorrow - the idea I had was for the game to begin with the characters being interrogated, and their answers to form character creation, informing attributes and so on.<br/><br/>Is this something that could work? Or am I being too ambitious?<br/><br/>Paul pointed me at Dread, which apparently also uses questions to shape a character, but I was wondering what other games approach character creation in a different way? Best Friends immediately springs to mind, but what others?                </div>

So, basically, your character is as dynamic as the game makes them except for one piece of narration that you give at the beginning. But it has to be through the eyes of your assassin.                        </div>

Sounds great. I think that it immediately conjurs images of Orwell's 1984, which I suspect is a prime source for the game.                        </div>

Yes lying would be fun, if problematic! I'd say in character, no the interrogators won't know. I think to facilitate lies, it'd be neat if occasionally the player leant forward to the GM and whispered "that was a lie." Maybe he could get some sort of benefit for lying, but the potential for recriminations later.                        </div>

So, basically, your character is as dynamic as the game makes them except for one piece of narration that you give at the beginning. But it has to be through the eyes of your assassin.<br/><br/>Hmm, that's neat. So the initial description sets your character up, personality and description-wise at least? I like that.

                            Not really, no. But I could see easily how to incorporate that in a more meatier game. As it stands, it was written to be a game that any group could play so long as they had cigarettes to use to vote with. Everyone tells stories and others either acknowledge or  counter the story with one of their own.<br/><br/>I should admit that I haven't actually gotten a game of it run before.

                            It's an interrogation.  Of course there will be lying, either witting or unwitting, on the part of the person being questioned.

Yes, I think why they they kept a secret would be interesting - how do you think could that inform chargen?<br/><br/>I envisage this interrogation to just be a routine interrogation that everyone endures now and again, but this one will be the one that tips the characters over the edge, galvanising them into doing something about the corruption. I think cracking them would be neat though too. At the heart of the system are the Conspiracy Points used for currency by the players, and Surveillance used by the GM - I can see the players' answers informing the starting number of these too, depending on how much they spill, how much they keep secret, and how much they crack.                        </div>

Well I'm thinking of just having 4 very broad stats which correspond to broad personality attributes (logical, intuitive, subtlety, directness), and <i>how</i> each question is answered will lend itself to one of these, regardless of <i>what</i> is said. Then the specifics of what is said will define more specific traits.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>So an exchange like this... <br/><br/>...helps set up a kind of 1950s Organization Man kind of ambience and with respect to the characters establishes that Rosenkrantz is at least suspected of being "an active member of the conspiracy" and Guildenstern may or may not be her accomplice.

And if I begin with some very broad questions ("name? occupation? etc") then these later questions can be much more specific and tailored. The answers can inform the broad personality attributes, as well as any personality traits, skills or whatnot.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>In a heavily narration-based game, such free-form attributes may be all you need.</blockquote>
It's not heavily narration-based (there's a GM and everything!), but knowing where my own preferences lie, it will certainly be narrative. I think free-form attributes are the answer though, even though I don't entirely have a grasp on what form these will take yet.

You know, I'm wondering the same thing. In fact, does it actually form some sort of a graph with the two axis intersecting? So you have logic and intuition on one axis, crossed by directness and subtlety, and stats can fall anywhere between them all?                        </div>

Yeah.   I'd thought the same basic thing, actually, but didn't feel like I had a clear enough handle on what you were up to, to know whether that was a decent fit for it or not.  Depending on what you're doing with them, though, the implication of  "positive" and "negative" directions on the graph is potentially cool, potentially problematic; there's a definite association, at least in my head, with the directions, usually.<br/><br/>The potential results, though, remind me of the internet-meme "political compass" quizzes, etc.  It might be fun, if you really embraced the graphed-results idea, to take a look at the code from one of those and write one up as an online tool/promo thing...                        </div>

You're not being too ambitious.

Or use that as the scene frame only ... play begins with the characters in the place the question mentions, and with the question it asked as the goal or main thrust of the scene.                        </div>

That's a cool idea too - I totally want to embrace the whole interrogation thing. I definitely want it to form character creation - that's set now, and starting to form quite nicely (actually I've used Spirit of the Century and the way it encourages you to develop aspects from a series of questions and situations as a source of inspiration). <br/><br/>But I also like the idea of using interrogations more in play. I don't want the game to be all about the interrogations, so I want regular sessions too, but I think I'm going to encourage the occasional (1 every 4 or 5 sessions maybe?) interrogation session, especially as the paranoia and conspiracies begin to mount. I think these interrogations would be good to use as a means of exposing plot, just for a change of pace.

This is totally stolen. I hadn't considered the possibility of getting the other players involved (except perhaps splitting up interrogation duty). It's cool to get them all involved and to riff off one another. Might be good if they bounce character ideas around too, whispering ideas and passing conspiratorial notes to one another. Conspiratorial notes really need to make it into the rules somehow :-)                        </div>

                             No, I'm pretty certain there's something buggy in Vanilla.  It seems to come up, for me at least, when I highlight-and-quote text, rather than just guoting it or not doing so at all. I just stick a html backslash-a tag at the start of my post when it's doing it.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: andrew_kenrick</cite><a></a><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Excellent.  You must do this, now.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the article (I think it's Emily's) in Push Volume <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> about new ways of distributing/sharing authority/responsibility in RPGs, it's well worth doing.  I've filed it away in such a way that now, whenever I'm considering a game mechanic, I ask myself how to make it collaborative.  I don't always *go for* the collaboration, but I think in a game with interrogation as the character generation theme, applying collaborative (even meta-competitive) techniques is going to be your watchword.</blockquote>
I haven't gotten around to picking Push up yet - I think I will now though. So would that be collaborative for the entire game, or just character creation?<br/><br/>Well, that's your call.  Emily's article talks about each part of a game and how collaboration can be brought into it.  Like I said -- well worth the read.                        </div>

                            Probably don't need it, but another data point is that I run a HQ scenario I call OtherWorld at cons where the idea is to create characters completely in play. We start play with a blank character sheet, and then I say, "Three figures come over the horizon...what does your character look like?"<br/>
<br/>
And we fill in the character sheets using the "As You Go" method of chargen from HQ. Basically players make up their characters in response to what's happening. What's interesting is the diversity of characters you get, given the same stimuli given to a group of players.<br/>
<br/>
What makes it work is presenting the players with the situation, and then having slots for stuff on the character sheet. The players come up with answers to the implicit questions like "What does my character do for a living?" that the Occupation Keyword represents, and "Where does he come from and look like?" from the Homeland (and Species) Keywords.<br/>
<br/>
So as long as you have a system with some structure that's asking questions, and a situation that gets the imagination going, I've yet to see a player who hasn't been able to come up with a very interesting character in only one scene of play.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, not too ambitious. Looks like you have precisely what you need already.<br/>

So how does HQ translate all that into mechanics? Would a player say "I'm tall and athletic" and then write down "athletic - 3" or whatever? Or is it all descriptive?                        </div>
