One is for individual soldiers, and the other is for the squad as a whole.  Originally, XP just gave you more dice in your dice pool.</p>\n<p>I used to call the two kinds of XP <em>Mettle</em> (soldiers) and <em>Clout</em> (squad).  I really, really don't like how precious those terms are.  I flirted with <em>Grizzle</em> for the squad too, and that was even worse.</p>\n<p>During play, I started calling Clout "Squad Dice", and frankly, I like that better.  I never found a better name for Mettle.  Soldiering Dice just doesn't roll off the tongue.  So that's the first problem.</p>\n<p>The second problem is that the XP aren't really just dice anymore -- they're resource points, and buying dice is just one of the things that you can do with them.</p>\n<p>I need some suggestions for what to call both kinds of XP, please!

And that suggestion will get negated should the mechanics work against the suggestion (and/or the player becomes disgruntled).<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought I'd suggest that. In terms of theme I previously read, soldier XP could be "I can't forget" points, while squad XP could be "We can't forget" points. The suggestion in the name is that they have seen events they wish they could forget, but can not. And so on, the dice in your hands are an extension of unpleasant, unforgetable memories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136186/#Comment_136186" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T16:51:00+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  4:51PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hi Callan,</p>\n<p>I think that you're confounding Memories, Stories, and XP.

Let's back up a sec, and do a quick terminology run-down.</p>\n<p><strong>Fiction</strong> is the moment-to-moment stuff you create while you're role-playing the game.  This is normal scene-to-scene/free-play/conflict resolution stuff.<br/>\n<strong>Stories</strong> are the end-of-game retellings of moments from the fiction.  They're literally "war stories".  They aren't necessarily told by a player character.  They are tales that make it back from the front, somehow (maybe a letter home, maybe a newsreel, etc.)<br/>\n<strong>Memories</strong> are the game's equivalent of character skills.  They're invented on-the-fly, as needed, by the players.  For instance, if you're in the middle of a firefight and you really, really need to make a good shot, you could create a memory for your character: "I used to shoot varmint back on the farm with my brother Jeb."  Bingo!  Your odds just got better during conflict resolution.</p>\n<p>Now, the two items I'm looking at renaming (I'll use the generic terms Character XP and Squad XP as placeholders).</p>\n<p><strong>Character XP</strong> are meant to represent the character growing as a soldier.  Things that make a character more likely to gain this award are: risking your life, risking your chance to go home.  Things that this award can be used for: helping your fellow soldiers win conflicts.  It can't be used to help yourself.<br/>\n<strong>Squad XP</strong> is meant to represent the squad as a whole getting more hardened and professional.  Things that make the squad gain XP are: losing members (either to death or tickets home), and losing exemplary members (same reasons).  This award can be drawn on by any player to improve their odds during conflict resolution.</p>\n<p>Both kinds of XP started out as Gift Dice (TSoY) clones.</p>\n<p>So, the names for the XP awards need to encapsulate their function as well as that notion that gaining them isn't necessarily good for the character <em>as a human being</em>.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking along the lines of "Blooded" and "Renown" (Character and Squad, respectively), but I'm not sold.<br/>\nD</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136349/#Comment_136349" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T15:40:14+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  3:40PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'll be blunt, but with a constructive intention: That didn't answer my question at all.<br/><br/>Contrasting two examples. Example one, lets say I'm making a war game and I grant soldiers characters "soldier skill improvement points".<br/><br/>Example two, lets say I make a war game and I grant soldier characters "These men will know things I, as a player, will never know, thank god. And they will do with them things I, hopefully, will never do except here, in game, to try and deal somehow with such an important tragedy". I know, crazy long name - it's for contrast purposes.<br/><br/>The first doesn't tell you what your playing for, the second tells you what your doing any of it for. For what purpose are you imagining (were not imagining for imaginings sake, it's for real life use/purpose), and then what your should imagine to meet that purpose.<br/><br/>I think the first name can fall into "imagining for imaginings sake". As I understood BC, you were doing it for a real life purpose. Does that suit your goals?<br/><br/>On a side note, I was berated on the forge for being an amateur advising others on nar design.

For me it evokes weapons, extremes, and a testing of the sort that has to provoke change in that which it tests. It's an internal quality, not flashy or active. And I like the feel of the word in my mouth.<br/><br/>There's something to be said for Callan's We Can't Forget thing for the squad points. They're all about why the Staff keeps that skull in her quarters for us and how we got it and why so few of us were there for it while the rest of us are replacements fresh out of Basic and what it means for us to have troopers who survived it fighting beside us. It's about our identity as a squad and <i>profanity, profanity, profanity</i>, Darcy, that's it!<br/><br/>That's it, that's the thing, the ineffable, gappy . . . thing that I had.<br/><br/>The game continues as long as one trooper survives the session, right? (By "survive" here I mean "live and not go home".) You could conceivably play a dozen sessions, see complete squad turnover five times, with just a fragile thread of eleven sole survivors to pass the baton of squad XP down through time.<br/><br/>Dude, in a game about Memories and Stories, why is it that the only thing designed to persist throughout play is a numerical stat? What if there were a persistent thematic element, something like a trooper's Memories, but that newbies to the squad can tap, or that the squad can tap on behalf of the newbie. What if the squad could tap Stories?<br/><br/>Or -- maybe you've already solved this by linking new to old trooper backgrounds or something. Or maybe the ending rule is actually that the game continues as long as one <b>original</b> trooper survives, in which case, please ignore my demented babbling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
