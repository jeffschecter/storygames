Fallout is not even damage!  Fallout is fallout, which is a different thing, it's the potential for character change, mostly bad, some small bit of it good.  Damage is just the increased likelihood that the character will cease to be, which is change, I guess, but a sort of lame one-note kind of change.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131348/#Comment_131348" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T14:26:19+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  2:26PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, this is a weird-ass perceptual thing.  Or, it is to me, at least.<br/><br/>In a serious majority of RPGs, every character has some "pool" that either gets added to or drained away.  When manipulating that pool is capable of causing catastrophic character change (like, say, death), those are hitpoints.  Sometimes a bit of mental effort is needed to slot them in, but that's cool.<br/><br/>A couple of reasons I think this matters:<br/><br/><b>Hitpoints are easy to grasp.</b><br/>When a game does not have something that can be thought of in this way, and puts the potential for catastrophic change into a totally different deal, it's being counter-intuitive.  Which isn't necessarily bad, but if it's going to be understood and used, it needs to 'splain it really, really well.  To me, one of the things that works smoothly in Dogs is that while it fallout generally acts as a different deal, a reader can still think "hitpoints" as a placeholder and carry on.<br/><br/><b>Hitpoints are points.</b><br/>And, as such, are manipulable.  There's all these cool things that can be done with points, and Dogs does a whole bunch of them.  Delaying the "damage" rolls until a pause in, or the end of, the fight (what happens if you stuff "pauses" into D&amp;D combat, those moments where there's a natural break in combat, and only roll damage at those points?).  Creating different ways to regain / get rid of them (Choices!  What if I had a list of scars available in a dungeon crawl, and could kill damage from a hit by taking one?).<br/><br/>So...   Fallout is hit points.   Or, if you like - Fallout is an example of what Hit Points can become when fine-tuned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131349/#Comment_131349" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T14:27:35+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  2:27PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not even always a signifier of cessation.

From my perspective, any resource mechanism where the extreme end is "Your character is defunct / story finished / dies"?   Those are hitpoints.  <br/><br/>To my thinking, it seems like it's common to try to get rid of hitpoints, when in some (NOT all, but some) of those cases, we'd be better served by making cooler hitpoints.<br/><br/>(Or maybe I'm the only one that does that.

I think if you used a different term like "character changing resource" (awkward I know, best I could do on short notice) and then substituted this term everywhere you say "hitpoints" above, I'd be in total agreement, because the logic is sound and the approach quite functional.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to me, Hit Points is a really bad word to slot into that role.<br/>\n<br/>\nHit Points to me are a resource that goes in two directions...up and down...where down in always bad and up is always good.  There's never a case in D&amp;D; where having HPs go up is a bad thing.  There's never a case in D&amp;D; where HPs going down is a good thing (sometimes its an "I don't care" thing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFall out, however, OFTEN is a good thing...a very very good thing.

(*ahem* GLASS)<br/><br/>So, say I have Health, Alacrity, and Psyche. Each are a class of "hit point," but they are ALSO triggers to "fallout" AND measures of effectiveness. My Health 4 lets me pass Health Threshold Tests up to level 4; it also determines when my character becomes unconscious (Health 0) and, thus, when I am forced to portray that--pretty straight-forward.<br/><br/>But Alacrity 0 is different: I can't use Tiring Abilities nor can I run or jump ("Drained") nor can I pass any Alacrity Threshold Tests. But I'm not "out," just suffering from some (temporary) "fallout."<br/><br/>And at Psyche 0, I must either (a) behave as a Catatonic, if I did it to myself, or (b) portray an extreme Phobia of the entity/object which did it to me, both until Restored to at least 1 Psyche (with encouragement to RP lingering effects until full normal value). But in addition to that, Psyche determines how long I am at risk of death, if I Commit to a conflict: One of the main Toggles in the system is what happens at Unconscious. Either you become Killable by anyone who is willing to take the time (World Priority); or you can only die if you Commit--which lets you regain Consciousness and restores you to full normal Health--and then are again knocked to Health 0 within (15 - your current Psyche value) minutes (Player Priority).<br/><br/>Lots of data dump there, but it sums simply: sometimes, "hit points" only dictate behavior, not viability or participation; and, further, they can be directly coupled to efficacy at "skill-like" activities (which sort of makes sense: if I am knocked down to 1 Health, why would I still be able to Bend Bars and Lift gates?). Going to 0 "(Alacrity or) Psyche Hit Points" gives me a significant "(Drained or) Insanity" temporary trait. Even Unconscious is a sort of pseudo-trait, not "Dead" like in D&amp;D (which is only Mostly Dead, as we all know).<br/><br/>Thus, there can be a complete overlap between d20-like "HP" and DitV-like "Fallout" inherent in the system: neither one is necessarily a sub- or superset of the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132530/#Comment_132530" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T05:14:17+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  5:14AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't own dogs, but as I understand it hit points are a means to an end, fallout is the end itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming the reason for playing at all is story, fallout is story. It's the bad stuff that happens to a character which, when repeating the important parts of a game session, you'll talk about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one brings up that they lost four HP. It makes no difference that you lost four HP (except in some death spiral system). It only matters when the last HP is gone, and even then the entire emphasis is on the characters death and not on hitpoints. But with fallout, the entire emphasis is on the fallout. Or in short, a series of hitpoint removals doesn't make a story - certainly not something a participant will remember and talk about afterwards in detail.
