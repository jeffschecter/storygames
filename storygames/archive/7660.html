Then the points are added up and winner narrates (essentially)<br/>\n  In order to mix it up a little and add a level of tactics, I wanted to add an ability to play a point of Grit instead of a Trait. Possible uses for grit are as follows:<br/>\nMake it Count! - Double a Previously played Trait (Yours or others)<br/>\nNot so fast... - Cancel a previously played Trait (Yours or others)<br/>\nAnticipation - Do not play a Trait now, but Interrupt another player after they have declared what Trait they will play. When you Interrupt them, your Trait technically is played before their Trait is.<br/>\nCounter - Do not play a Trait now, but interrupt another player after they have declared what Trait the will Play. When you interrupt them, your Trait technically is played immediately after theirs.<br/>\nDenouement - Once you play this point of Grit, no other Traits or Grit may be played during this Challenge<br/>\nEscalate! - Bump the Challenge Die up one size<br/>\nIsolate - Bump the Challenge Die down one size<br/>\nAdapt - Play the point of Grit, then immediately Play a Trait (yours or theirs) with an incorrect Arena Tag<br/>\nBend like Reed - Spend a Point of Grit, and select a Trait in Play that was not played by you. That Trait is treated as if it was also, separately played by you. This play is not affected by any play against the original trait or vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The design goal for Grit is threefold:<br/>\n1) Add a CCG-Like play mechanic complete with Speed tactics, Counter tactics, interrupts, combos, etc.<br/>\n2) Reverse stunting - Entitle Players to narrate over the top action. Basically, if they spend the point, they get to narrate anything that justifies the in-game effect of their play<br/>\n3) Promote/Support Creativity - What I mean is, most people can think of a non-fighty use for heat rays or a fighty use for "gift of gab." The goal is to support those, but still provide a structure for making and using Super Powers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Based on that criteria, can you think of:<br/>\n1) Other cool uses for Grit<br/>\n2) Cooler names for the uses that I have listed (Except for Denouement I am not thrilled by any of them).<br/>\n  So, let me know what you think of, ok?<br/>\nDave M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
