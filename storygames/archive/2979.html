Most people who responded were actively gaming, they just often weren't actively playing much of the stuff they spent money on.<br/><br/>Links are as follows:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2912&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2912&amp;page=1</a><br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?p=7236241#post7236241" rel="nofollow">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?p=7236241#post7236241</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showthread.php?p=99050#post99050" rel="nofollow">http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showthread.php?p=99050#post99050</a><br/><br/>The rpg.net thread got a disappointing response, but I know that site well and already have a pretty good idea how few games people there are purchasing are actually seeing actual play.<br/><br/>One interesting point was that lot's of folk were playing a wide range of games, it wasn't that unusual to find a White Wolf game sitting cheek by jowl with a storygame or PTA with D&amp;D.  I find that rather heartening personally.  As I both hoped and expected, there are no camps in roleplaying, just a spectrum of tastes.<br/><br/>A lot of folk, maybe most, were buying more games than they actually played.  Indeed, it was fairly common across all sites for there to be people who had already bought more than they could credibly play over the next few years but who were showing no signs of slowing their purchases.<br/><br/>Time was a common factor, unsurprisingly, people not having the time to buy all the games they bought.  That does raise the question of why people buy them though, which may be worth following up on.<br/><br/>Lack of confidence came up occasionally with indie/storygames, a perception that they couldn't be sold to the group or that the person wouldn't do them right, that sounds worth addressing to me but I'm not a designer so I leave that to others.  I do think though that potential actual play is being lost by people feeling for whatever reason that they're not up to the task.<br/><br/>A lot of people were buying games for inspiration, or to pick out a couple of ideas.  That's interesting, albeit expensive.  I think that's often a way of justifying purchases that the person knows are basically useless, which is probably an incredibly arrogant thing for me to think but there you go.<br/><br/>In terms of conclusions, my conclusions are these:<br/><br/>Many gamers buy far more games than they can or ever will actually play.<br/><br/>They do so from a mix of hope that they will play a game, that hope winning over experience, from a desire to pick up some inspiration and ideas or simply because they enjoy collecting.<br/><br/>The result is that many published rpgs, and to be clear I'm not talking especially about storygames here though I think it's now starting to hit this sector too, see little actual play compared to how much they are actually purchased.<br/><br/>I think the outcome of that is that playability is not a major factor in game purchases, because most purchases see little to no play.  Instead idea stealability and the shiny factor tend to dominate.  I think that results potentially in weaker rpgs generally, but now I'm leaving the horrifically biased and useless data behind and going off on an extrapolation of my own.<br/><br/>And so I think we have a gaming industry which is supported by sales of games that by and large are seeing little actual play, and that is not because the people buying them are not actual players, it's because they're actually playing a tiny subset of the stuff they buy.<br/><br/>Of course, these purchasers are a small subset of the hobby, but I suspect they are a large element of the part of the hobby that buys games.<br/><br/>I'll give more thought and say if anything else strikes me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67787/#Comment_67787" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T07:43:23+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  7:43AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting results... and I would tend to agree that, for the most part, the hobby's sales revenue is generated by people (like me) who buy large number of games and supplements that we either don't manage to or don't intend to play!

I think often people are buying the dream of play, often I think people want to believe that one day they will play it.<br/><br/>In a depressing way, that's very safe for people, there's no risk of other players messing a game up, it's perfect because it's never played.  I think it's connected with The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast concept, people crafting a perfect story in their heads, a perfect game, then finding that shared creation with other participants makes realising it impossible (as it should, we're gamers, not novelists).<br/><br/>I think if you removed the illusion that purchases will get played, people wouldn't purchase them.  Like perfume, much of it IMO is buying a dream.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67791/#Comment_67791" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T07:48:32+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  7:48AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting stuff, Balbinus, thanks for taking the time to do all this!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite><br/>Lack of confidence came up occasionally with indie/storygames, a perception that they couldn't be sold to the group or that the person wouldn't do them right, that sounds worth addressing to me but I'm not a designer so I leave that to others.

If a person can't understand a game from a single read through or is often confused then it's hardly surprising they'll be discouraged from actually trying to run a game.  I see this as the single biggest barrier for anyone writing indie games to overcome, and one of the most difficult.  It requires playtest and review by people outside the community in order to work, and that's very difficult for a lot of folk to acquire.<br/><br/>If someone is confused or, for whatever reason, doesn't finish reading your product then they're not going to play it and introduce it to others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67792/#Comment_67792" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T07:51:57+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  7:51AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.W.Richeson</cite>I think this is because a lot of indie games gloss over presentation and readability while focusing too much on the mechanics - like a scientist writing a journal for peers rather than laymen.</blockquote>\nName them names, C.W.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67795/#Comment_67795" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T07:55:09+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  7:55AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, just to say, I welcome people discussing how this applies to story games and all, given where we are, but to be absolutely clear my OP is about the industry generally and only that one para quoted is specifically about story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67796/#Comment_67796" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T07:55:18+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  7:55AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max, I can think of another reason for the phenomenon - I've no real idea how widespread it is, but one reason I end up with a fair number of unplayed games on my shelf is that I want an "arsenal" of games to pitch. In the times I've had a regular group that rotated shorter-run games, we've often chosen games to play by asking the prospective GM(s) to pitch multiple different games and doing a ranked preference vote to choose what gets played. In order for that to work, it helps to have a brace of different games in your library that you can pull out. Inevitably, some of them are not going to work out for some combination of reasons involving personnel, time, genre, mechanics....<br/><br/>I suspect that some degree of your perceptions are the result of your preferences: If you like a technically-minimal "fade away" approach to mechanics, and play many different settings/genres with an eye toward prioritizing a personally-customized spin on those settings/genres... you only really need a few games. Find one or two systems that work for you mechanically, and then all else is reference works.<br/><br/>If you play a lot of short-run games, have diverse appetites in terms of genre/setting, AND like mechanics-forward designs, a big arsenal of games (and probably a fair number of "read this to steal things" games) is a worthwhile thing to have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67799/#Comment_67799" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T07:57:43+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  7:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, I can't know if I want to play a game until I've bought it and read it through twice.

It was just less marked a gap than it was for those with other preferences.<br/><br/>The phenomenon still seems to be there, it's just that by the nature of their play they got more use.

Short-run players are just as likely to have the problem, maybe more so. Every time we change games, there's between 1 and (say) 8 games getting pitched. Only one of them is going to get played this time. There are 7 "bought, but not played" games sitting on shelves. In the X months before the next pitch round, other cool new games will intrigue someone enough that they'll want to buy, read, and decide whether to pitch. Some of those purchases will ultimately not get pitched for one reason or another after reading/discussion. So that's some additional number of "bought, not played" games.<br/><br/>The low-volatility people potentially have the same problem, but there are two mitigating factors: first, they're more likely to pitch new variations on setting/situation/color/character within an existing system (so they don't buy a new game - at most, a supplement or two); second, they pitch less often, so there's less hope that any "cool new thing" is going to see play in a reasonable time window (thus depressing the urge to buy and read said thing in time for the next pitch round).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67806/#Comment_67806" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T08:11:04+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  8:11AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I did misunderstand, thanks Mark that makes more sense to me now.

Just about all the games I've ever run were story games. I couldn't imagine running a mechanics-heavy game, with the possible exception of Burning Wheel. Just the other day I was reading through Pendragon Fourth ed. and my first thought was: Holy shit, this is cool. My second thought was: I wonder if there's another ruleset I can convert this into? So... yeah. It's the more mainstream games I'm nervous about not doing justice to. \n<blockquote><cite>CommentAuthorC.W.Richeson</cite><br/>I think this is because a lot of indie games gloss over presentation and readability while focusing too much on the mechanics - like a scientist writing a journal for peers rather than laymen. If a person can't understand a game from a single read through or is often confused then it's hardly surprising they'll be discouraged from actually trying to run a game.</blockquote>\nI ran my first indie game (My Life with Master) within the first six months after my first foray into the hobby, so it's never felt difficult for me. But then again MLwM is a very well-written game, so that might have eased the passage as it were. At any rate, the indies always seemed to come more easily to me than systems like GURPS, which I've played for over a year (half the total time I've been in the hobby) and still don't get.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67819/#Comment_67819" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T08:39:17+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  8:39AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 8:39AM by C.W.Richeson.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><br/>Name them names, C.W.</blockquote>\nIn my own recent experience (and off the top of my head) I've found <i>Capes</i> to require several read throughs to get down, and even then my confidence level wasn't very high.  On the other hand, I ran <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> the same day I first read it with no problems.  Clear and interesting writing, good use of examples, and tables summarizing important concepts often make all the difference.<br/><br/><i>Beast Hunters</i> resulted in some head scratching and page flipping to get Trait/Resource stacking down - probably about an hour's worth after my first read through.  A few examples incorporated into the text to clarify this while reading would have been very very helpful.<br/><br/><i>Hearts &amp; Souls</i> was so system light that it was difficult for me to visualize it in play.  The examples were comprehensive, but needlessly long and generally uninteresting.  Like <i>Capes</i>, if I hadn't been reviewing it I probably would have put it away and gone to do something else - the product just couldn't draw me in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67822/#Comment_67822" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T08:43:13+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  8:43AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The C in C.W. is for crticism!<br/><br/>And games get better and the community is healthier for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67831/#Comment_67831" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T08:57:25+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  8:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just realized that my RPG spending vs. actual play habits tends to match my general book buying habits.

An equally large collection of videogames and DVDs that I've never used in an RPG session.  Does that make them a waste of money?  Of course not, that's absurd.  If I buy an RPG product with the intention of running it, there's a high chance it'll never get played for simple logistical reasons.  That's a straight numbers game:<br/><br/>I am old, so are my mates.<br/><br/>Therefore I have F free time, where F is quite small.<br/><br/>They have similarly small values of F.<br/><br/>The overlap between my free time and theirs is even smaller.  Well call that f.<br/><br/>f is very small indeed.  In this case, f is about equal to one game session per week.<br/><br/>Because I am old, I have plenty of money.  Once I've paid my mortgage, pension, gas/electric bills and whatever, there's still quite a bit left over.  So I can pretty much buy whatever I want when it comes to RPG books and other gaming stuff.  I can afford to buy way more RPGs than I do.  I can afford to buy way more than I have time to read.  Have time to read way more than I have time to run.<br/><br/>But, in order to make sure that f is used as effectively as possible, I spend some of my other free time (F-f) in various other RPG related pursuits.  One of these is online discourse.  Another is reading games so that I can choose to run only the best ones when I get my one weekly session.<br/><br/>And, y'know, I <b>like and enjoy</b> reading decent RPG books.  I recently read a whole bunch of the Torg product line with no intention of ever running it.  I consider those purchases worthwhile because, to be honest, they actually represent a pretty good entertainment/cost ratio.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
