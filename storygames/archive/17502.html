They rescue a young girl from dragon-worshiping cultists by throwing meatballs (<i>Hawthorne was a Human Cleric of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, chose Magic Missile as his Wizard crossover spell, and had them look like what do you think?</i>) and commanding underlings to surrender and leave.<br/><br/>Then, to the library, where a somewhat incorporeal, intelligent undead attacked from flight, summoning monsters out of books and crushing a poor cultist inside a doorway.  Orson bull-rushed him off a second-story balcony into the stone floor below, fortunately getting a low damage roll.  Back on the second floor, Finnegan guarded the poor girl they saved with his enormous (and messy) flail as an owlbear emerged from a book and attacked.<br/><br/>The noble undead was no good match for the Orson / Hawthorne pair (<i>with the former on offense and the latter on defense</i>), so he attempted to summon another monster for the bottom floor.  As the book flew towards his hand, Hawthorne shot it out of the sky with a pair of meatballs and Orson was able to chop off the nobleman's arm with one swing from his sword.  They recovered a magical longsword and two symbols of nobility from the corpse (<i>both bearing the sigil of the castle</i>).<br/><br/>Then they took the girl back to town for some rest (<i>where Hawthorne brushed up on his First Aid after losing his cure spell that night to the FSM's displeasure</i>).  Orson decides to quest to slay the dragon who seems to be the source of all this trouble, and is blessed with an unwavering sense of direction to it as well as invulnerability to any unarmed (natural) attacks.  His deity agrees as long as he fights with honor.<br/><br/>They set off directly towards the dragon, but the trailblazer (<i>in his haste</i>) leads them into a ravine which ends in an enormous cliff face.  Orson and Finnegan are able to scale it (<i>though Finnegan, as a halfling, needs more climbing gear to make it up</i>), but Hawthorne has to backtrack to reach the top.  He reaches the others in an hour or so, with the odd sense that someone is following him...<br/><br/>Not bad for three hours, with new players, including rules explanations and character creation!<br/><br/>(Originally posted on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/118034745833600671063/posts/ehKT6AcEFhZ" rel="nofollow">G+</a>.)<br/><br/><hr/><br/>I felt that this went great, though I'm really going to have to use an adventure starter one of these days.  Yeah, I stole the dragon-worshipping cultists from somewhere I can't currently remember, but I think that actually having the starter -- the impressions section in particular! -- would be extremely useful.<br/><br/>I did have some trouble making hard moves; there are many warnings scattered across the web about not just doing damage to characters, but allowing them a chance to react.  These guys all come with over a decade of D&amp;D experience each, so I was trying my best to keep them out of the turn mentality, but that meant that they often got to hack and slash when I probably could have just done damage.  It also meant that the undead in the library seemed less scary than I was attempting to make him (kind of a scaled-down lich-like figure, shadowy and incorporeal).  Eh, one-shot.<br/><br/>Suggestions, questions, comments, concerns would be appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396848/#Comment_396848" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-08T09:52:10+00:00" title="November  8, 2012  9:52AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Making hard moves is a tough thing, especially since it's a style. For every person who mentions that hey need to use more, someone else will talk about how the PCs were dropping like flies.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say you're wrong! It's just a tough thing to provide any blanket advice to. The concept of GM moves is a great tool, but it doesn't get rid of GM-skill, it just aids it (hopefully).

Sometimes this means that you and/or the players learn something or re-align your expectations. Like this:<br/><br/>"The mummy, with a sudden burst of blinding speed like a serpent striking, lashes out with its bandaged fist, sending you hurtling across the chamber into one of the ancient pillars, which cracks and sends bits of masonry raining from the ceiling. You take 8 damage."<br/><br/>"Whoa, hang on, can't I get out of the way?"<br/><br/>"Nope, its strike is far too quick. Didn't know mummies could do that, huh? But now you can see the horrible thing is somehow diminished, turning in a slow, shuffling circle back around to where you've landed. The glow within the hollow sockets of its head is dim, not the flashing green fire you glimpsed earlier."<br/><br/>"Ah ha. Cool, okay, I rush up to backstab it before it can recharge!"<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>Or this:<br/><br/>"Whoa, hang on, can't I get out of the way?"<br/><br/>"Well, I was thinking this would be a cool special mummy thing, the sudden dizzying speed."<br/><br/>"Yeah, that's cool. But I got to defy danger against that cobra-god from before. Seems like the same thing."<br/><br/>"Hmmm, yeah. What do you do? Maybe roll with the blow? Okay, defy danger +dex to see if you can avoid half the damage and tumble with the force of the blow. On a 7-9, though, that pillar still cracks and the ceiling might come down at any moment."<br/><br/>"Oooh. Yeah. Cool."<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>"Whoa hang on, can't I get out of the way?"<br/><br/>"Nope. It's a special mummy thing. Sudden explosive speed faster than any living being."<br/><br/>"Can I speak the word of rebuke though? That's pretty fast. Maybe it would blunt the speed or power of the thing to hear the holy name of my god."<br/><br/>"No, the mummy is far faster even than breath or speech. Like hummingbird-wing fast. But you <i>are</i> a monster-hunting cleric of the Bone Dragon god. Maybe you thought to shout your word of rebuke as you rushed toward the thing? Defy danger +wis. It's still far too fast to avoid the blow, but maybe you can sap some of its unholy power."<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>etc. etc.<br/><br/>The idea is, you don't have to do it all by yourself and try to get it perfectly right every time. Say what's what, ask questions, answer their questions, refine, re-align, elaborate, reveal -- as needed.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396870/#Comment_396870" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-08T15:50:17+00:00" title="November  8, 2012  3:50PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ^ This fuckin' guy.
