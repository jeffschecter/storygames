Friday night I played board games until late in the evening.  Saturday morning more board games, and then Puppetland with Ara, and Ami run by Todd Love.  Then I ran a session of Poison'd that ended abruptly just as it was getting good--will try again next year--with Ara, Parke, Sam, Frank M, and Josh Mannon.  Then Ami, Kat Miller and I went and played in Josh Mannon's Harry Potteresque playtest game, Boarsdraft and had a brilliant time.  Sunday, more board games!<br/><br/>But mostly I got to see my friends, and that's always the best part!<br/><br/>Be there next year!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ninesling" title="Ninesling"><img alt="Ninesling" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ninesling">Ninesling</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325820/#Comment_325820" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T08:15:24+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  8:15AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had an amazing time! I was really happy to see all my old friends and meet some new ones. Some of the highlights for me were...<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Jeffrey's WWII Cthulhu/Dread mash up.   Jason(?) and Jeffrey whispering spooky/creepy stuff while we pulled blocks was really effective. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Rachel's big reveal at the end of "A Taste for Murder" was totally epic. I really loved this game and I can not wait to play it again. I am definitely buying it ASAP<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Jenn's "Project Ninja Panda Taco" was a lot of fun, and I laughed my butt off the whole time.  I especially liked character creation, and thinking of stuff for my minion's tool belt. I can not wait to see how her game develops further. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. diXit was a great game that I have never played before. My kids love apples to apples but I think they would have even more playing this and the artwork is amazing. It is on my must buy list. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. Cleaning out the women's bathrooms with Connie on Sunday morning is the kind of bonding experience that strengthened our sisterhood. <br/>\n<br/>\n6. Joanna spent Saturday night reassuring me that "Everything is fine, they are just bugs, go to sleep" only to admit Sunday morning she was freaking out as well but she didn't want to push me over the edge so she was being stoic for my sake. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all I had an amazing time and I can not wait to go back. I miss you guys already. Thank you for everyone who made the weekend happen!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325824/#Comment_325824" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T08:33:31+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  8:33AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2011 6:57PM by Todd_L.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            May I usurp a tale of Seth's?

For me the weirdness started when I arrived. Me and David were the first ones there by about an hour. We used the time to catch up on all the things we didn't know about each other from our casual/twitter relationship. We help haul some luggage for a few other early arrivers and when Mark and Andy arrived we pitched in unpacking the boat load of groceries that were tightly packed in a car that I'm suprised Mark could fit in. Being early ment I got a chance to say hello to most everyone as they arrived which was awsome. I got to shake hands and get hugs from so many people I know only online. Friday's weirdness ended with a game of Freemarket. The constraints of that game somehow enhance the gonzo.  And then of course there were late night conversations I can barely remember. <br/><br/>Saturday morning I ran my first Boarsdraft Playtest which I've talked about at length elsewhere. Just let me say here that it was awsome and fun. After lunch I had three games fall apart so I just hung out a bit before Shane pulled some folks together for Poisn'd. As Shane said the game sort of fell apart right as it was getting interesting and I really hope to get the same group back together for another try next year. After the players with other games left I pulled Shane, Amy and Kat into a second playtest of Boarsdraft which was much smoother due to the changes I'd made and pointed out some other flaws in the system. After that game I found myself in way over my head in a conversation with Todd, Ben and a guy I didn't catch the name of but who has my email. That conversation (which I think was a game when it started) turned into a playtest of the guy who's name escapes me's (edit: Mendel) game Space Cowboys. Just from that playtest I highly recommend both Space Cowboys and Christmas Ninjas (another game he ran that weekend)<br/><br/>Sunday morning I was exhausted and had a desporate need to see my family so I skipped out on Jason's Fith World playtest which I'm sad about but theres always next year right? (as long as the world dosn't end). All in all a great time and much of it wasn't the gameing, the gameing is all I know how to articulate. To everyone I met, you are awsome, amazing people who I hope to keep in contact with. You made this con the best gameing experience I have ever had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325843/#Comment_325843" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T09:55:38+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  9:55AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2011 10:41AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a long list of RPGs I like, but a very short list of RPGs I can call favorites.

Or maybe I just like playing with Arnold Cassell (who ran/facilitated both games).<br/><br/>It was great to turn a bunch of familiar internet names into real people, play with some folks I always see at cons but have never really interacted with before, meet totally new folks, and reconnect with some I haven't had more than a brief chat with in years.  Gaming, banter, and frisbee for all!<br/><br/>There was some chaos, but the organizers did a fantastic job making sure the essentials were covered so we could frolic.  Food, beds, parking and gaming locations were never in doubt.  The food was shockingly good, actually.

I'm glad that the reputation was well deserved; the folks at Nerdly take their chores seriously, and everyone pitched in and made things move fast.<br/><br/>Afterward more small games, Cat and Chocolate, Catch the Lion, Ascention, all good stuff.

My time was unstructured, which was about what I wanted, given my neophyte status and my generally lose attitude.

I had fun playtesting Boarsdraft with Josh. The schedule did cause a bit of stress, but I think that was mostly a matter of expectations not matching reality. Some tweaking might help that, though. The weather was great, the people were great, the food was great. The only time I was bummed about not getting to play a game was Saturday night, after tucking the kids into bed, when there didn't seem to be any pick-up board games happening. I spied on an awesome game of PTA, though, which was almost as fun as playing, and I got to play a weird German card game before bed, so it was all good. I joked afterwards with my husband that there needed to be a couple of "looking for a pick-up game" hats that people could wear when they are observing another game to pass the time, but secretly hoping to find their own game to play in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326326/#Comment_326326" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T10:57:25+00:00" title="May 25, 2011 10:57AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The weather was fine, and I had no complaints.  I was escaping the Florida heat all weekend, so anything else was welcome.  Earlier in the year could be nice too.  I like the cold.<br><br>The food contributed to the schedule slippage this year.  (This was my first year, so I don't know if this is common.)<br>Saturday's breakfast was so intense, that lunch prep was pushed back an hour, which blew the first afternoon slot away, leading to delaying dinner, destroying the schedule further.<br><br/>I want to say that the schedule could have worked itself out.  Had we begun the weekend with an individual page per slot (those huge 28x36 pages taped to the windows) already out and ready for editing, and had the food not been so epic, I believe everything would have worked better.<br/><br/>A lot of people were holding back what they offered because they didn't want to get stuck running a game the same time as something they wanted to play.  Myself included.  No amount of scheduling rules are going to change that.<br/><br/>Also, the common stuff table was a little confusing.  Were those boardgames/books just open to anyone who wanted to play?  Were they there for trade?  Were they there for sale?<br/><br/>Maybe a little sign for "all items on this table are ___" would help in the future?  Then anyone looking for something do to could just grab them and go, no questions.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joanna" title="Joanna"><img alt="Joanna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joanna">Joanna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326329/#Comment_326329" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T11:15:48+00:00" title="May 25, 2011 11:15AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a fantasic time!  The weather was beautiful, I played some great games, met some new people &amp; talked with old friends.    <br/><br/>My only disappointment was not getting to play Puppetland.  But with our morning game of Old School Hack running long, lunch starting late &amp; my being on kitchen clean-up duty after a late starting lunch - that second Saturday slot became too tough for me to reach.  So I went for a hike and took a nap instead. <br/><br/>Otherwise, the scheduling hiccups didn't really bother me. I'd rather not see Camp Nerdly become a highly structured event.  That's what I get from a convention.  Nerdly, for me, is for playing like a kid plays, not Playing like a grown-up with a PDA and a purpose. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326350/#Comment_326350" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T12:59:01+00:00" title="May 25, 2011 12:59PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was my first Nerdly, and my first time meeting anyone there. It felt a little intimidating at first, but it was a great group of friendly people. I got a chance to play a number of games that I'd only read about before, and I hope I get a chance to play with a lot of you again. Dreamation/DEXCON are looking more interesting now, as is trying to sync up with the rest of the community in the DC area.<br/><br/>The disadvantage of being fairly unconnected to anyone else was that when the first line of scheduling fell through, there wasn't much of a safety net. So I found it somewhat hard to get into a fallback game. I think a tiny bit more structure here might help -- something like a "LFG" signal that says you're willing to be pulled into a spontaneous game, or a blank sign-up sheet for "available now for anything". Just something to provide that extra bit of activation energy to get games rolling, especially for us introverts.<br/><br/>Also, hand soap in the bathrooms. That'd be good.<br/><br/>But overall there were almost too many good things to count. Great weather, extremely friendly people willing to explain new games, impressive food, and a great community spirit for tackling the chore list. <br/><br/>Games played: (Apologies if I've munged any of the names)<br/>- Apocalypse World, run by Sean Leventhal. A great introduction to the game, with a special player appearance by Ranger Todd, who was probably the only walk-in Camp Nerdly attendee. <br/>- Montsegur 1244, run by Patty Kirsch. Another great game, though it would have perhaps been better with another player or two. I felt my focus was spread a little too thinly over four characters, and ended up not doing justice to my "main".<br/>- Keep on the Borderlands, Basic D&amp;D, run by Adam Dray. This was a riot. In the course of a few hours we charted the sort of degradation into mindless villainy that took me almost two years of play in middle school.\n<blockquote>GM: "The sign on the cave says 'Welcome all adventurers! Please come in and enjoy meat and ale with us!'. Inside there are three bugbears, smiling. They carry metal skewers with chunks of meat on them."<br/>Sean &amp; Dave: "This seems like a trap."<br/>Ben, entering: "F*cking metagamers."</blockquote>\n- Last Train Out of Warsaw, run by Jeffrey Collyer. Nicely atmospheric. I think we could have used another player or two here as well; one of the players ended up largely segregated from the rest of us. But the game still delivered on the promised experience.<br/>- Fiasco, with a bunch of people. A good Sunday morning game. I could only play half before I had to leave, and I don't think that those of us who were new to the system were really hitting on all cylinders until the end, but I could certainly see the potential.<br/><br/>Thanks again to everyone I interacted with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326373/#Comment_326373" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T14:08:25+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  2:08PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2011 2:12PM by Mark_Causey.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please take the following survey about your experience at Camp Nerdly:<br/><br/><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEpXRmxKQmtjRmotekhyX25TamRjTFE6MQ" rel="nofollow">Survey</a><br/><br/>Thank you to an assisting angel on this who may self-identify if it is desired.<br/><br/>John, can you change the thread title to include the fact that there is a survey?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326552/#Comment_326552" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T17:35:24+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  5:35PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a game of Apocalypse World at Camp Nerdly.  I felt it went really well given that I had no one who had played before.  In fact among my players were two people who I believe were new to the story game community and attending their first Camp Nerdly, and a walk in.  One of the staff at the campground stopped by and got hooked up in my game of AW.  This was awesome.<br/><br/>We had a Hoarder that was clearly inspired by Ariel from the little mermaid.  This combined really well with the Quarantine (Fry) played by the walk in.  The hoarder would put a label on the quarantine whenever he fell asleep "Genuine pre-apocalypse human male" and Fry always had something to fall back on.  There was also a brainer floating around as well as a chopper.<br/><br/>This was my first attempt at running a one shot of Apocalypse World.  Looking back I made a couple of mistakes.  I should have pushed harder to set up inter-character conflict.  Even with the brainer out there the players got along pretty well, they were even willing to go to the brainer for medical aid.  Contrast to my regular game where the Savvyhead's medical technology is rightly feared because when he heals people aquarium tubing and pumps seem to dissapear and their stomach just doesn't feel right afterwards.<br/><br/>The other mistake I made was not spending an extra five minutes figuring out character motivation and hook.  I could have easily let people socialize a little longer and it would have done a good job covering for some of the inconsistencies in the NPCs, and uncertainty in their goals.<br/><br/>The walk in took away a copy of his character sheets, as well as a moves pamphlet and information about where to find the game.  I took that as a good sign.  Since I have received some positive feedback so I think it went pretty well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326592/#Comment_326592" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T20:51:56+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  8:51PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a million things I want to say about Nerdly, and no time to do it right now.
