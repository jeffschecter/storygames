It really is about categorizing <i>general trends exhibited across many, many instances of play</i>, since individuals and games can easily move between different Creative Agendas all the time.  It's really about tendencies and modes more than anything else.<br/><br/>So the real answer to your question is: depends on who's playing it, what they're doing right now, and what they've been doing previously during the rest of the session and the rest of the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214406/#Comment_214406" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T17:08:03+00:00" title="June 25, 2009  5:08PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2009 5:09PM by Steerpike.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I may be wrong but doesn\u2019t GNS and the like apply more to an agenda in play and not the actual game itself?

BW has no Premise, in the Forge sense; no embedded, specific theme or moral quandary. As such, it can't support Story Now unless the group devises a Premise, plays with it, and hey, the mechanics don't get in the way. Any game can be used for any CA, but the question of how "helpful" they are to any particular agenda is an open question.<br/><br/>Yes, absolutely - I agree that the Agenda arises from play and from the social contract; it's runoff or something from the stream of play, so to speak, and cannot really exist unless play is realized.<br/><br/>Personally, I think BW <i>supports</i> intensive Exploration of character, and the advanced rules (the Rim) support Right to Dream play.

So its' been a subject of debate for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Exploration of character" was one of those hornets' nests that pushed towards things like the Beeg Horseshoe, El Dorado, etc. From a GNS point of view the question is always 'what are you doing with that exploration?'; the meta-question that the Big Model has to deal with there is whether there is a clear long-term answer to that question and, if so, whether such answers reliably break down into the different categories.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn rpgsite 'incoherentist' might suggest that BW's system-ambiguity makes it a better game, and might try to use that to explain why it's done relatively well as indie games go in terms of sales.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust trying to be helpful here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214416/#Comment_214416" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T17:57:02+00:00" title="June 25, 2009  5:57PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

I've played half a dozen games of Dirty Secrets which is full bore Story Now.  I couldn't tell you what the Premise of a single of those games was.  With some careful reflection I'm sure I could identify the central crisis the Investigator was facing and with some more careful reflection I could probably refine that into an articulated Premise.... but why?  What mattered is that the narrative moment-from-moment was compelling in terms of real-world human passions and culminated in a thematic resolution that was built and arrived at through play itself.<br/><br/>That's why Burning Wheel is deceptive.  Assuming people write Belief's that they care about in real world human terms and assuming the GM hits those Beliefs the way the book tells you to, you get Story Now.  It doesn't have to be articulated as an official Premise.  People who are invested in the developing story AS a story (and not as an intellectual construct) interact with the Premise quite naturally.  Most of the people who can't grok Burning Wheel are confused by what appears to be a tactics focused system when in reality those tactics are a support beam for what the game is really about: standing up (or not) for your Beliefs...

It's ability to cover all my group's gaming styles and needs is one of the things that I fell in love with. We can easily cover the full range of GNS in a campaign, session or even a single scene which keeps everyone happy and it's all done in a way that all the characters can participate and shine.<br/><br/>As far as the premise goes, I think that's an explicit part of setting creation, assuming you're doing it as a group activity. One of the things the book doesn't really outline very explicitly (it's more apparent in the <i>Blossoms</i> setting) is that the secret to getting great BW games is burning up your campaign together rather than the "traditional" method of the GM showing up at the table and saying "this is what we're doing. Make some characters."  Running a PTA-style pitch session at the beginning of my BW games has always guaranteed some very evocative, character-driven stories and makes writing BITs much easier for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214469/#Comment_214469" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T00:59:44+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 12:59AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Argh! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> That's something I have such a hard time grokking - should a game *come* with a Premise, should one be *decided* during character creation...??<br/><br/>Jesse, I've decided that in any future designs, I'm just going to include rules for devising a Premise right next to the rules for making Kickers for the PCs.

(Yes, its' been said already, but it bears repeating since people are always confused by that.)<br/><br/>Christian Griffen has called Beast Hunters a "gamist" game -- and yet, when I play it, we were being narritivist all up in this house. 4e is, in fact, neither inherently Gamist, Simulationist, or Narrativist -- it's what the people at the table make it. (I believe my 4e gets narrativist at times -- not because we aren't "playing the game" but because the gamey parts gave context to the "let's roleplay story" parts.

It's also cool to push each other's buttons, rather than going begging to the GM, "Please please master, please push my button!"<br/><br/>BW certainly facilitates that sort of play, but IMO it does it <i>because</i> it's agenda-agnostic and it has very clear play procedures that allow different buttons to get pushed throughout the play experience. So you don't constantly have, like, a tactical minigame in your face every time you want to just play (although the haters seem to think DOW is exactly that). And you don't constantly have, like, Premise and Theme and Very Important Shit in your face when you just want to kill something (although the haters seem to think the Artha Cycle is exactly that).

It's a very common confusion, that really don't help discussing these things outside of The Forge...  :-(<br/><br/>Jesse is 100% right, by the way. BW doesn't need any formulated premise to be a story-now facilitating game. <br/><br/>A creative agenda is observed during the full course of a game (from 1 to 20th level in a D&amp;D for example), not "moment by moment". In every game session there will be moments where you'll try to "win" a fight, but it's not at that scale that you observe the creative agenda<br/><br/>If a group want (consciously, or by habit) to play with a different creative agenda, all they have to do is drift the game. This drift can be really subtle and transparent, or very minor, or need a strong house-ruling, or can't be done without destroying anything in the original game: often people confuse the difficulty of this drift with game coherence, but they are really two different things: if a game facilitate (or provoke) "story now", it's coherent, even if  a minor drift is enough to change it to a Right to Dream facilitationg game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214547/#Comment_214547" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T09:45:49+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  9:45AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify what Moreno said a bit, the exact time-span we use in analyzing CA appearance nowadays is a single "reward cycle". This is the span of interactions that provides the payoff a player is looking for in a game (which happens to also define the play's CA: your Creative Agenda is the reward value your play is seeking to fulfill). I'm mentioning this because I've never analyzed D&amp;D in terms of really long-term play - it does have some reward cycles that go on that long, I suppose, but surely nobody would play it if those were the most important ones.<br/><br/>For Burning Wheel (or any game, really), the first step in GNS analysis needs to be forming a theory of interactions for it: what are the actually interesting and significant parts of the process of play for the players? If BITs factor highly in your analysis of what actually is interesting in BW, then you're probably leaning towards playing it in a Narrativistic manner, because that particular mechanic happens to be a linchpin for the dramatic matter of character identity in this game. If, on the other hand, you're really interested in how characters are shaped by their experiences and how the character burning process creates organic characters, then it might be that you're seeing the simulationistic potential in the game. The tactical parts in the combat system could conseivably inspire some sort of gamism as well, although the chargen system and that stuff would probably get fragile if the players oriented towards that from the get-go.<br/><br/>I don't know about the hypothetical simulationistic or gamist ways of playing the game, but I do understand the narrativistic reward cycle in BW somewhat: the reward payoff comes in the form of situations that force characters to rely on or deny their BITs, which in turn reflects dramatically as either affirming or transforming the character's identity. The payoff often comes after the action, when the players are considering whether and how the BITs should change. The other xp systems support this identity development from the margins, too. It's really quite similar to <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, BW just has more complex complementary mechanics for what happens as consequence of choices made. <i>HeroQuest</i>, TSoY and BW are from this viewpoint on one line from lightweight to heavy mechanics, even while the Creative Agendae they support are near identical.<br/><br/>But the important part is, when we're discussing whether "BW is narrativist", what we mean is to ask: how do people derive satisfaction from playing this game? If just one way is dominant because it's so obvious and the rules do such a good job at that, then we might say that the game is coherent and indeed "is" narrativistic in that sense. But all that comes second, after we've first figured out the reward cycle and what the people are actually enjoying when playing the game. The road from that practical play situation to the game text as an abstract entity is long and convoluted, and the many layers of interpretation in between may well change how people see the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214552/#Comment_214552" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T10:01:01+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 10:01AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in a BW game and I'd say it's Story Now, and that the play procedures in the book help out our agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure what the Premise is - maybe something to do with Authoritarianism? - but that doesn't really matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calithena" title="Calithena"><img alt="Calithena" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calithena">Calithena</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214558/#Comment_214558" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T11:01:25+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 11:01AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, Moreno,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe length of reward cycles itself is a problematic issue, how many of them there are to be identified in a particular span of play, and to what degree they co-exist, conflict, or mutually reinforce.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's when you focus on the longer-term reward cycles that the CA-focus idea is most plausible and the labeling of most traditional RPGs as incoherent makes the most sense, IMO. But even there it's got issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you adopt a more catholic interpretation of 'reward cycle' (as in perhaps: here's something that the group was going for over interval t that they enjoyed getting (or got frustrated over not getting)) then things get more complex still.<br/>\n<br/>\nEero, I basically agree with what you're saying, but there are things I wonder about. Let's consider a BW group who really, really gets into making the right decisions in dueling combat and pwning their foes. They brag and compete for success at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that's all they do with it (I knew Champions groups like this, 'let's get to the bouts!') then you could identify them as focused on a Gamist CA I suppose. And some of the mechanics support this in the sense that your decisions in dueling combat are a big deal as to the outcome. They are in effect playing 'burning wheel minis' or something like that (not with minis, just that's the kind of game they are playing).<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's say they do that AND they are also focused on the character decisions that you and I both identify as central to the design, varying from scene to scene. Then we might spot a larger N arc with (complementary) G cycles within it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then what if the BW GM is kind of a hard-ass, and ultimately won't let you work through your whole arc of character transformation except by winning the fights. PCs die sometimes. And there are plenty of both kinds of scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some groups this would be frustrating, because they'd want one or the other more or less exclusively, or they'd want one to mostly be there at the service of the other. (dueling combat supporting N: only the fights that matter to your BITs. BITs and character story supporting G: those elements provide extra color to intensify the challenge, just as when kids shoot free throws they always imagine it's game 7 of the NBA finals and their team is down 1 with 2 shots and the clock out).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for other groups, I can see this being a positive reinforcing dynamic. When your character becomes who he is in the N sense it's also because he Stepped On Up a lot of times and proved his worth in battle to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't see why the longer-term reward cycle couldn't in the end be describable as both G and N in this sort of case. This is just one example, there are lots of others. This is why even though I'm on board with the Big Model as a whole I see the CA-focus idea as an artistic possibility (one not realized in most of the games proceeding the Forge crew, with some exceptions from Robin Laws and others) that is worth exploring but not a theoretical truth pertaining to all gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214568/#Comment_214568" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T11:42:42+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 11:42AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Separate reward cycles should be able to deliver rewards for different CAs, agreed. I don't know if it is feasible to have conflicting cycles like that exist within each other during play, though; in parallel I can see it, it's the same old effort at fulfilling two priorities at the same time. In shorter term and longer... perhaps - the closest I've experienced in actual play is different CAs being satisfied in turns, as waves of 1-3 sessions at a time, swapping to the next CA as the composition of the play group changes or priorities shift for some other reason. I wouldn't say that those games have a significant long-term reward cycle that were formed out of smaller events, though; my characterization would be that they're just a string of separate cycles tied together by the ephemera and contents of play. When the CA gets shifted, incompatible content seems to get strongly pushed to the backstage until it gets a chance to re-emerge later in more favourable conditions.<br><br>I'm not dogmatically opposed to the idea of hybrid Creative Agenda, it's just that I haven't witnessed it myself. I have a suspicion that there is some social dynamic reason for why a single CA very efficiently conquers a play environment when the game gets really going (something like the players getting focused on reinforcing the reward cycle they're actually interested in the most), but I haven't the words and vision to verbalize this clearly at this point, and I don't think anybody else has really proffered a model for how the social CA develops out of individual interests during play. Perhaps somebody writes me a game at some point which includes a set of instructions that allow me to reliably provide a hybrid experience; if they do, that'll be a pretty clear nail on the coffin of the GNS theory.<br><br>Still, the point about BW stands - it's not the game itself that has a CA so much as it has one or more practical readings about how it's played - those playings have a CA in a much more concrete sense. The interpretation of BW as a narrativist engine gets the most attention with the local majority here in this corner of the Internet, which is why we say that BW "is a narrativist game". Heroquest is a lot like this, too - I've met many people for whom the game is setting/drama simulation, simply because they play it differently from how the Forge crowd does. It is not particularly contradictory to the theory for somebody to post about a radically different interpretation of the game, full of different technique and different combinations of the rules; they might overall strive for a radically different game experience by doing that, and possibly end up playing BW (drifting it, if one wants to presume that there is some "canon" reading of the game text) within a different GNS mode.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215018/#Comment_215018" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T07:48:48+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  7:48AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 8:05AM by Thor_O.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>BW has no Premise, in the Forge sense; no embedded, specific theme or moral quandary.

Nor do most of the most influential games from designers who were members of the Forge have an "embedded premise."<br><br>Premise at the Forge is defined as, "A generalizable, problematic aspect of human interactions. Early in the process of creating or experiencing a story, a Premise is best understood as a proposition or perhaps an ideological challenge to the world <i>represented by the protagonist's passions</i>. Later in the process, resolving the conflicts of the story transforms Premise into a theme - a judgmental statement about how to act, behave, or believe. In role-playing, "protagonist" typically indicates a character mainly controlled by one person. A defining feature of Story Now."

One thing mechanics do is that, if you follow the procedures of play, they have a great influence on what you're going to spend a lot of your playing time with and what kind of opportunities for certain interactions among the players you get at what frequency.<br/><br/>Let's take 4e. Sure, you can try and focus on the story and premise in that game. But once you start a combat, you're going to spend a considerable amount of time with it, right?  And during that time, it seems to me that you'll have a considerable number of opportunities to address challenges and probably not nearly as many opportunities to address your premise, test your character's passions, etc.  Sure, you can have thematic decision points in 4e combat, but I would argue that the rules set ensures that your challenge-addressing actions vastly outnumber those. You could avoid combat, but then, you're avoiding the vast majority of the rules.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel's BIT system, on the other hand, can come into play several times even in combat.  There are more built-in opportunities, given the same amount of playing time, to address premise when using that system.  And in fact, the game gives you a way of resolving combat without the complex systems if you like (with a simple comparative roll), which allows players to spend their playing time on other things if they so choose.  All of that puts it much further in the story now-promoting camp than 4e.  Like we say, it "supports" a certain agenda more than another because, when you use the rules, you get more playing time with and more opportunities to address story now.<br/><br/>The reason that Beast Hunters can support story now play to a certain degree is that goals allow you, in any given combat, to let the character make a meaningful thematic decision using the mechanics.  Any combat can become a question of what could be worth risking your win for (because you spend precious resources achieving story goals, and those resources are the same you'd use to defeat your enemies).  But most of the rules are more focused on giving opportunities for setting up and addressing challenges. You're going to spend a lot of your time doing maneuvers, and every maneuver is a chance to step up plus a chance to make a risky move (picking dice over guaranteed rewards).  <br/><br/>So: while I agree that a game itself isn't determinative of an agenda, it seems to me that a lower-case system surely has a big impact on what we're going to spend a lot of our playing time doing and what kinds of decision points we are presented with using the system during that time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215617/#Comment_215617" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T22:04:45+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 10:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite>Let's take 4e.

I am beginning to see where he might be coming from; let me toss out a few things I've been mulling over.<br/><br/>Consider this premise: "'We must hang together, because we will surely hang apart.'" 4e is all about teamwork in combat: a Controller slides an aggressively-committed Striker out of the dangerous position he took up to make a devastating attack; a beleaguered Defender steps up and risks serious harm to ensure that a flanking Striker maintains his favorable situation.  Suppose that, in the fiction, the characters don't like each other at all, but have a grudging respect for each others' expertise.  Then, when I activate my encounter power to drop a cloud of Minions, opening a path for you to charge in and land a telling blow on the Elite bad guy, we're not just playing Battletech; we might be having a conversation about our interdependence; when your guy, instead, screams at mine to drop those minions but instead I'm busy establishing a safe position from that Elite, we're talking about our mistrust.<br/><br/>Consider, instead, that maybe we can act like WotC designed what didn't matter.  We're presented with a choice of extirpating a colony of kobolds or turning back an ambitious (maybe even greedy) group of human miner colonists who want their land.  What matters is our judgment about who we'll be fighting.  That the fight will itself be a fun game is a lagniappe.<br/><br/>Just my $.02.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215621/#Comment_215621" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T22:15:00+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 10:15PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Christian!  In the 4E game I'm currently running, emulating old school video games is much more important than the tactics involved in winning fights effectively.  Like, even during the fights, the most important thing is getting the feel right, not the "challenge" or wagering social capital or the "exploring my mettle through struggle" that I normally associate with Gamism.  So, yeah, combat alone isn't enough here, I don't think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
