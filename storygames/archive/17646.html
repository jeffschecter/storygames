This has got me thinking about whether the phrases come up frequently in play or just work as a stick to keep players from doing things they think will get called. I'm sure I have seen some AP posts before but don't remember specifically any ones with discussion of the phrases.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399704/#Comment_399704" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T14:40:47+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  2:40PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group recently concluded an Archipelago campaign. Those players who thought it was fun to try out all the tools in the tool box had used all of the phrases by the end of first few sessions, but use of of the phrases dwindled after that. <br/><br/>For us, the phrases were more like training wheels than anything else. "That might not be so easy" seems superfluous when every player has the power to simply make things more difficult through description. "Try another way" got less important as everyone developed a common understanding of the game world. "More detail" got less use because people just started describing things with more detail. <br/><br/>The exception was the "interlude" phrase. That got a lot of use all the way through the campaign. I think the reason is that the "interlude" phrase is a method to frame a scene while the other phrases are meant to alter the story within a scene. <br/><br/>I'd say the phrases were useful in the sense that they provide a way for players to request story changes during the game without feeling rude (though, "try another way" can come across as aggressive even when it's codified in the game). I think the gaming communication skills you use in Archipelago can be incorporated into a lot of story games. And, my group has continued to drop in interludes even after Archipelago. That said, the phrases aren't really necessary in a mechanical way the way phrases are necessary in, say, Polaris.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399705/#Comment_399705" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T14:52:18+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  2:52PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We should be playing next week at our local indie gaming night.

We end up using the phrases quite a bit - especially 'More detail' and 'try another way'. Their intended use - to ensure that everyone's vision get's representation - is of course great. However, after things are a bit more established (a few scenes/a session in) they're a really cool tool to push each other - either using more detail to direct each other to make an element of a scene more important/weighty, or try another way to force each other to make a less obvious choice.<br/><br/>'That might not be so easy' falls by the way side pretty quickly - not that we don't keep using the mechanic, just that it gets shorthanded to a look. I guess we both have a similar sense of when a chance of failure would be interesting, or at least get on the same page quickly.<br/><br/>I'd say that especially with a younger player keeping all or most of the phrases is a good call - they're a good tool for getting players to stretch and describe. And, by being an explicit part of the rules, they never give kids the impression that you're calling them out for 'doing it wrong' (which is always a creativity killer) - you're just playing the game as written.<br/><br/>Finally, I'll say that a special look of glee appears on my 8 year old's face when she tells me to 'try another way' and I am obliged to do so. Is an interesting subversion of the usual parent-child relationship.<br/><br/>Finally finally, would be totally interested to see your mash-up rules. The kid loves Cthulhu Dark, too, and some tentacle-flavored Archipelago might be right up our street!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399955/#Comment_399955" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T09:39:53+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  9:39AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It will not be Cthulhu oriented.
