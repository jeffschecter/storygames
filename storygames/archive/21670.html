You just reminded me of the Dark Souls RPG (2017, Katou Hironori/Group SNE) whose combat system is basically what you described, though with more granular numbers and mechanics inspired by the video game.<br/><br/>Each turn you roll up to 5 stamina dice. Weapons have a cost to attack that varies with the weapon (lighter weapons cost less, deal less damage; heavier weapons more, and making multiple attacks usually costs n+1 for each additional attack, so lighter weapons are also easier to chain attacks with). Everything else you just burn a die of any value for things like using an item, swapping equipment, or changing your positioning in the fight. Shields and weapons also have set costs to block attacks with, and dodging has costs that vary depending on your encumbrance level. Various character special abilities also have associated costs, a lot can only be triggered by spending a pair of dice that rolled the same number for example.<br/><br/>Probably too detailed and fiddly for what you were going for, but the variation in weapon costs and their effects on encumbrance might appeal to people who like the "twelve different kinds of minorly differentiated polearms" part of D&amp;D :P                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474166/#Comment_474166" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-25T13:39:42+00:00" title="May 25, 2018  1:39PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">@yukamichi</a>, thank you for your recommendation!

The downside of Otherkind dice being d6s is that it doesn't offer a lot of room for granularity (this is a boon and bane), but the d20 does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474175/#Comment_474175" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-25T21:56:15+00:00" title="May 25, 2018  9:56PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a few problems with that.<br/><br/>First of all, play will come down to people doing the math for each action, and seeing which dice can most effectively be used there. Maybe your 14 isn't enough to hit the enemy, but it's just high enough for your defense roll, for instance, so the choice is clear.<br/><br/>That's a very slow process, and not particularly fruitful, in my opinion. It allows you to optimize your choice of dice and actions to have the best outcome in each round. ("OK, how much damage does that thing do? Can I take two more hits? Or should I use my die to defend?")<br/><br/>In comparison, the kind of conflict resolution you get in Otherkind makes you choose between weighty and different, consequential resolution points. Each die assigned (in a well-designed system, anyway) transforms the situation and means something in terms of how the fiction develops next. Did some of your allies die? Did you manage to make it into the castle? Will the tribe hate you forever?<br/><br/>Given the implementation described here, it's not a terribly exciting prospect, I think. But that doesn't mean it couldn't be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachlan" title="lachlan"><img alt="lachlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachlan">lachlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474181/#Comment_474181" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-26T12:11:41+00:00" title="May 26, 2018 12:11PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ve run a sort-of Otherkinded sci-fi Western loosely based on the movie Cowboys &amp; Aliens and agree that it\u2019s all about conflict resolution, and only the important conflicts, at that. That beng said, it should certainly be possible to give Otherkind some D&amp;D \u201cflavour\u201d. It just wouldn\u2019t be crunchy, which for me is the appeal of Otherkind. Maybe use it to bring D&amp;D players over to the storygame side?<br/><br/>Anyway, based on what I played, when stakes are announced, player rolls 3d6 (or 3d10, or whatever), with an additional die if they\u2019re especially prepared (ie a fighter who is fighting, a thief who is thiefing), then allocate to Outcome, Risk, and Fallout (do you get what you want, do you get hurt, does a friend get hurt) with low rolls being bad, high rolls being good, and mid-rolls being a mixed blessing. Mess around with extra dice for specific conditions and *maybe* die-roll mods to handle small differences.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474185/#Comment_474185" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-26T16:37:58+00:00" title="May 26, 2018  4:37PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two things, <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>.<br/><br/>First, in the matter of battle as a form of conflict resolution, a more involved rolling and adjudication system may be desirable. In a combat-heavy game like D&amp;D, the depth of the combat engine is important to the feel and focus of gameplay. In editions of True D&amp;D (by which I mean, somewhat tongue in cheek, those older editions, retroclones, and assorted OSR games), combat is a weighty and dangerous affair. A strong mechanical focus on this allows players a greater degree of control over the flow of battle through tactical depth. Do I use my highest die for attack or defense? What if one succeeds and the other fails? Ideally, each of the rolls would have a bit more heft to them if you\u2019re using Otherkind methodology (e.g., an attack roll is almost certain to kill or seriously maim as opposed to doing a meager 1d4 damage against a hit point blob).<br/><br/>Secondly, and a bit glibly, there\u2019s an expected degree of min/maxing when playing D&amp;D. Player skill matters. I think you have to accept that with all the other conceits of D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474187/#Comment_474187" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-26T18:07:57+00:00" title="May 26, 2018  6:07PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, indeed. It's more a question of taste; the system being described here, so far, doesn't sound like much fun to me. It could be entirely different for someone else!<br/><br/>My guess is that making those decisions round-to-round will be time-consuming and either tedious or extremely obvious ("well, obviously, I'll use the highest die to avoid the Death Spell, so I guess that means I don't hit my opponent..."). However, playtesting may show otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474188/#Comment_474188" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-26T18:28:35+00:00" title="May 26, 2018  6:28PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2018 6:34PM by Kenny_J.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could always tack this on to D&amp;D without changing the core resolution with the D20. <br/><br/>You still roll D20 for your attack and either hit or miss based on AC, but for the rest of combat description and outcome could come from rolling 3d6. You establish stakes that are other than "I hit them" and go from there. The d6 outcomes a player chooses helps fill out scene details.<br/><br/>As for non-combat situations you might be able to do the same with skills, but I think you would be running into the task vs conflict resolution's problem. But you could do it. Maybe you just roll the d20 along with 3d6 (or however many). The problem is that you can't move the d20 result around like the rest of the dice, unless there some sort of subtracting the value and putting it elsewhere. But yeah it may not be worth it at that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/instinctive" title="instinctive"><img alt="instinctive" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/instinctive">instinctive</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474738/#Comment_474738" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-14T06:27:45+00:00" title="June 14, 2018  6:27AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Torchbearer. an OD&amp;D loveletter game, also aims for conflict resolution rather than action resolution, by abstracting away individual action in favor of party disposition and a rock-scissors-paper minigame. You can ditch the minigame, and replace disposition with Otherkind Dice. This strikes me as a strict improvement to TB.<br/><br/>(It doesn't solve the "problem" of giving up individual action resolution, which many people have trouble wrapping their heads around for TB!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
