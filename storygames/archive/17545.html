It went pretty well, but one of the players chose the Queen, and I want to make sure I MCed it correctly.<br/><br/>1) This Queen was a rough and tough male gang leader with literally dozens of fellow students doing his bidding -- from drug running to prostitution to murder. He ruled by power and fear. Thematically, it seemed like he should not have to roll to Manipulate an NPC whenever giving an order -- but I did not see any way around that, so we played that he had to. We did play that he could make a single roll for all of the gang when ordering them to act as a whole (instead of making individual rolls against each gang-member NPC). Correct? <br/><br/>2) When he did give a successful order, sometimes it was relatively vague, such as "let's go get those guys and make them pay!" In situations like this, if he and his gang are going after someone, would he have to give a separate order (and make a separate Manipulate an NPC roll) for each action he wanted a gang member to take? For instance, "shoot him," " beat her up," etc.? (We played that he did NOT, that his successful "let's go get those guys and make them pay!" was sufficient for any follow-up order.)<br/><br/>3) When surrounded by his gang, would he get +1 to his rolls for ANYTHING, or only actions that the gang was specifically helping him with. We ruled that he did not get a +1 to the Manipulate an NPC rolls he was making to order his gang around (seemed pretty obvious). But at one point, he was trying to either Turn On or Manipulate a gang member (can't remember which -- either way, it was basically an erotic manipulation). The rest of the gang was around, but it was basically him making the action. Should he have gotten +1?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397931/#Comment_397931" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T23:44:06+00:00" title="November 17, 2012 11:44PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not an expert, and I haven't even actually played M&lt;3s yet. But I would say:<br/><br/>1. If he's got people who follow his orders, then he can order them around and they'll do his bidding, or something similar. It's only if they *resist*, decide not to obey him, that's when he can choose to make the move and roll. So, it's up to you as the MC when that happens. But, sure, most of the time you can just have the NPCs nod and carry out his bidding. Just like real subordinates, you should carefully pick your battles, so that when he has to manipulate, threaten, or seduce an NPC to do his bidding, it's a BIG DEAL, revealing something interesting either about the PC or about his subordinates.<br/><br/>2. I think the Queen gets +1 on any roll where you, as MC, have clearly stated the gang is helping him with whatever he is doing. They are actually *doing something concrete* to help the Queen's action, whatever it might be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397985/#Comment_397985" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T12:05:09+00:00" title="November 18, 2012 12:05PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jda, good questions.<br/><br/>While it may or may not clarify any of these questions, the Gangs section on page 35 is a useful one to refer back to. Did the gang make demands and have some blind-action triggers?<br/><br/>1.) The Queen should be rolling to <i>manipulate</i> whenever he tries to convince/force someone to do something they don't want to do. I don't think every command he gives to a gang member will count, only the ones that (a) make them think to themselves "this isn't what I signed on for..." and (b) put them at risk or serious discomfort. So if this Queen is asking his right-hand man Tucker to watch the doors, that's only going to require a <i>manipulate</i> roll if Tucker is worried that he might get shot, or if he's recently come to doubt his Queen, etc, etc. Under normal circumstances, this is what Tucker signed on to do, and this is why he's a part of the gang in the first place.<br/><br/>2.) If he <i>manipulates</i> his gang into going and beating some dude, then he shouldn't have to <i>manipulate</i> them again for each specific action within that larger order. They've been convinced that it's a just and important thing to go beat this dude. They might lose faith, however, if one of their number gets killed in the process. And if they agreed to go beat this dude, and then their Queen was like, "Now execute him and dump his body in the river," that might require a second <i>manipulate</i> roll.<br/><br/>3.) +1 to anything the gang helps with. But note that (for example) if he's trying to <i>shut someone down</i>, having a gang looming behind him probably counts as helping. Your insults carry more weight when you've got a dozen goons jeering alongside you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398007/#Comment_398007" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T16:15:26+00:00" title="November 18, 2012  4:15PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the responses! I'd read the full rules twice before, but admittedly, once someone picked the Queen, I only had time to do a quick review of the abbreviated Gang rules on the Play Reference Sheet instead of re-reading the full section in the book. As far as I remember, the gang itself did not make any demands or cause blind-action triggers towards its member (the Queen), but the Queen did make demands of the gang.<br/><br/>It sounds like we played it right except for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> above; I had the Queen roll pretty much anytime he gave the gang a new order, even ones that thematically they might have followed. (I did not have him roll for follow-up orders like "Now that you've agreed to beat this guy up, I want you, you and you to hit him.") Most of the rolls were successful, and for those that weren't, I tried to find an in-character reason for failure while using my Hard Move.<br/><br/>Thinking it through for next time, would this be the best way to approach it:<br/>* During Setup, the MC and Queen player establish some NPCs in the gang<br/>* The Queen can drive how loyal each named NPC gang member is, though the MC could have some veto power (to avoid something like "Every single NPC in the school has 100% blind devotion without wavering")<br/>* During play, the MC decides if and when an NPC would question an order, thereby requiring a Manipulate roll<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398031/#Comment_398031" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T21:27:39+00:00" title="November 18, 2012  9:27PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see a gang helping on a Turn On or Manipulate roll. The key is whether they're doing something useful.<br/><br/>Does the person the Queen wants to turn on want to get in with the gang? To have the gang think the person's cool, cuz, hey, the Queen's spending time on this? Is the gang, for whatever reason, wanting the Queen to get laid by this person? If so, maybe they are trying to encourage this. As for Manipulation, think of all those cheesy Just Say No commercials and pretend the gang's trying to help the Queen get someone to smoke -- heck, for all I know, maybe that's exactly what's going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398044/#Comment_398044" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T23:49:23+00:00" title="November 18, 2012 11:49PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>* The Queen can drive how loyal each named NPC gang member is, though the MC could have some veto power (to avoid something like "Every single NPC in the school has 100% blind devotion without wavering")</blockquote>\nYou can also just accept any answer they give, but glance sideways at your principles.<br/><br/>If they say "oh, they all follow my commands no matter what," take a look at the <i>make humans seem monstrous</i> principle.
