Ideally, it would be a simple and short story structure, five or six scenes long.<br/><br/>The idea is that the participants in the game re-create or act out these scenes (freedom to act is not necessary here, following a script is fine), with a big surprise at the end. A murder mystery would be a simple and classic type of "Big Reveal" story, but I'm open to other genres.<br/><br/>I see two possibilities:<br/><br/>1. The story itself has a mystery which is revealed in the final scene, and casts the earlier scenes in some interesting light. (For example, the likeable character turns out to be the murderer, or vice-versa.)<br/><br/>2. The scenes are played out or re-created  *out of order*, and the particular sequence makes for an interesting revelation at the end of the game/story. Or, alternatively, in the end the scenes are placed in a different order (or in the correct order), and a different understanding of the story emerges.<br/><br/>I can think of two examples from other media:<br/><br/>Film: "Memento", which plays entirely in reverse chronological order, and where the "final scene" (the beginning) reveals the story to be quite different from what we thought. <br/><br/>Literature: "Hopscotch," a novel by Argentine writer Julio Cort\xe1zar, can be read in two different sequences, creating two different stories.<br/><br/>How might we create a much simpler, but similar effect, using only five or six scenes (or so)? How would you do it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392819/#Comment_392819" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T06:57:58+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  6:57AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not so good at planning this kind of thing.  Mostly I just rely on reincorporation.<br/>It seems like if the GM inserts something early on, and then twists it at the end, it only works when the players are invested in that thing.  The easier route (or maybe more lazy, I mean, I'll accept that I'm lazy) is to let the players introduce something and then reincorporate it and reveal later on.<br/><br/>All that to say:  I don't know how I would do it, but I'd like to hear other people's ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392826/#Comment_392826" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T07:39:48+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  7:39AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2012 7:42AM by Rickard.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always put in a twist, and I do that in the "sowing and harvesting" way <b>Harlequin</b> described: introduce something early and reuse it with a twist at the end.<br/><br/>Some examples:<br/>In Mutant Chronicles, I started off with playing out a scene with one character (an inquisitor) who found a bloody body under his duvet in his bed. When he removed the duvet, the Cardinal's inquisitors crashed through the front door. I then began the real scenario where the PCs chased a cultist who was transformed by The Darkness. During the scenario, the PCs were influences by The Darkness too. As the final scene, I played out the first scene again, but this time the PC got a look at what was under the duvet; it was himself ... and then the Cardinal's inquisitors crashed through the front door.<br/><br/>In a G\xf6tterd\xe4mmerung scenario at a convention, the PCs were a family and during the first scenes one were going to murder the father in the family, who later will become an undead with a goal to turn all the village people undead. I made a little twist and started the scenario with the father already dead and everyone, except one, was the one who killed him. (One killed him, he came back only to be killed again etc.) I wrote on everyone's character sheet how they killed the father, but on the guy who hadn't killed them, I wrote that he should try to figure out how the father died. Funny thing, in one group, everyone framed the investigator and killed him for his "crime". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> We all had a laugh when we were finished and revealed everyone's goals. So the twist was never revealed in the scenario, but after.<br/><br/>I've talked about another G\xf6tterd\xe4mmerung scenario <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17288/awesome-rails#Comment_392263" rel="nofollow">in another thread</a>.<br/><br/>This is just something I've been told, but a Vampire scenario had some malchavians (crazy vampires) flee from a mental hospital. They roamed the city, drinking blood, creating chaos but got finally caught by other vampires and left outside at a beach for the sunrise. They screamed in pain as the first beams hit them, only to discover that they didn't die. They were actually mental patients all along, believing that they were vampires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
