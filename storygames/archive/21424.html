The players assume the role of Acolytes of the Inquisition, an organization that protects the Imperium of Man from the aliens, traitors, and daemons lurking in its shadows. Though most will never glimpse their secret war, they continually combat forces of corruption that would otherwise destroy all humanity. <br/><br/>We are veteran players of Dark Heresy, but this is our first venture into podcasting. We focus on creating a non-linear, story heavy experience. We also heavily edit the episodes to keep the story flowing and the run time down. The first three episodes are available now, with a new episode coming out every Sunday. Join our intrepid heroes as they investigate, interrogate, and occasionally mutilate heretics throughout the Imperium.<br/><br/>Where to listen:<br/><br/><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/its-probably-heresy/id1333570234" rel="nofollow">iTunes</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=163871&amp;refid=stpr" rel="nofollow">Stitcher</a><br/><br/><a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Iats66h3ycvaeofg3h4bjnb5li4?t=Its_Probably_Heresy" rel="nofollow">Google Play</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCck-AuXWUfDMoARlMHIK7RijKkKySwbV" rel="nofollow">Youtube</a><br/><br/><a href="https://soundcloud.com/matthew-murcko/sets" rel="nofollow">Soundcloud</a><br/><br/><a href="https://itsprobablyheresy.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Our Blog</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" title="FriendlyAlienLocust"><img alt="FriendlyAlienLocust" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468912/#Comment_468912" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-14T19:57:50+00:00" title="January 14, 2018  7:57PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eh, I'm a sucker for passion projects. I tried it out.<br/><br/>I'm about to be critical, so let me preface this by saying this is your first podcast. You aren't gonna compete with Critical Role right off the bat. You don't have the experience, you don't have the production budget, you don't have the name recognition, and you probably won't for a long time. That's okay. Don't worry about making this podcast the greatest thing in the world. Go into this looking to make your <i>next</i> podcast even better. Once you have the knowledge and experience, you can revisit your old stuff and make it even better. Even professional podcasters don't throw all their eggs in one basket; just look at how many podcasts Austin Yorski is involved with (I heard you're a fan). Right now, as long as you aren't charging anyone money, you're doing everything right.<br/><br/>I'll focus on what immediately caught my eye:<br/><br/>1. No theme tune. Head over to <a href="https://ocremix.org/" rel="nofollow">Overclocked Remix</a> and snag a song. They got a huuuuuuuuuge selection of free music from hundreds of artists, including professional composers. <a href="https://ocremix.org/info/Content_Policy#If_you.27re_using_our_content_elsewhere_.28.22Terms_of_Use.22.29..." rel="nofollow">They allow you to use their music in podcasts/videos, so long as they and the artist get credit.</a> For reference, this is where Dice Funk gets their songs.<br/><br/>2. Speech. This will probably get better over time as you practice. Long story short, roleplaying for an audience is acting. You need to sell what you say, not just say it. Get animated, describe the world like it really matters. If you sound interested, it makes it easier for the audience to buy in. To see what I mean, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Morrison_(announcer)" rel="nofollow">Herbert Morrison's radio broadcast of the Hindenburg disaster</a>. It ain't <i>what</i> he says, it's <i>how</i> he says it.<br/><br/>3. Who are you guys, and why should I care about you? Are you just some dudes off the street? How well do you know each other? How many people are at the table? Do you have any experience playing? What's your favorite flavor of pie? If you're going to introduce yourself as a player, then you are a character, not just in game, but as a person. Especially when you're just starting out, your audience needs to like you. They need to want you to succeed, or they won't be able to gloss over the rough edges. And there will be rough edges.<br/><br/>There, three things. Welcome to podcasting! No one knows what they're doing, everyone's overworked, and no one makes any money. Woo!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyruss" title="Tyruss"><img alt="Tyruss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyruss">Tyruss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468961/#Comment_468961" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T01:46:28+00:00" title="January 16, 2018  1:46AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks for all your comments. We actually have several more episodes recorded and they hopefully will address those criticisms. <br/><br/>One thing I wasn't sure about was Point 1 though. There's no theme music in the first episode, but there is in the following episodes with a little intro blooper.
