Instead, untold years of isolation in their sealed city-shelter turns them into power-mad psycho freaks.<br/><br/>When they crack the seals on their enclave and emerge, do they start a school to teach physics to scavengers? No. They declare themselves the supreme race, enslave the mutated deep dwellers, conquer the underworld, and then overthrow the fledging surface empires.

We begged for succor from the Gevalt Clan, and soon enough the cramped quarters and bad blood between us led to a cattle heist that killed two Gevalti spear-youths. Lunar raiding parties have been stealing children from both clans and putting them in imperial frontier households to ensure they're raised by civilized folk. <br/><br/>Cue Hrothgar (yes..), Geatling Lawspeaker, defending Clan Geatling at the clanring <i>(like an althing; dunno if this is a Glorantha term or not)</i>, claimed that the Gevaltis have been using any excuse to start trouble with their unwanted guests. <br/><br/>Brigid White-Eyes, Geatling warrior and guardian of Hrothgar, leaps in uninvited and declares the Gevalti to be two-faced cowards who would rather take petty revenge on a rival than unite and face the child-stealing imperial menace. Since Brigid is there as a clanring bailiff, this is highly out of order, and both clans' Lawspeakers are stirred up by the breach of custom. <br/><br/>Skaldi the Sneak, representing the prosecution, declares that the ungrateful Geatlings had been waiting for the chance to steal Gevalti cattle and kill their young; there should be weregild, and it should be paid with a gift of Geatling children to the Gevalti clan council. <br/><br/>Hrothgar laughs bitterly and declares that Clan Gevalt can have all the children it wants, but that will not restore its honor and pride, nor erase the stain of their obvious collusion with the child-stealing Lunars! <br/><br/>Skaldi could have easily laughed off the wild accusation, but the look on his face makes it clear that it's actually true.

The bounty hunter is unphased, and he's like, "yeah, I'm looking for a guy who poured a can of hot oil on a woman down south, scarring her and making her rich family willing to trade some jingle for his head.

"Whoever does this stuff to a woman is my enemy.

They're Christian vampires - they believe the resurrection from revelations is you get to be a vampire, and the drinking of Christ's blood figures in that somehow - the vampires are the blessed who have inherited the earth. (And we came up with it thanks to Visage: Religious.) Their Obsidian Guard are vampires that dress head-to-toe in black armor emblazoned with white crosses - they can go out in the day thanks to their armor.<br/><br/>The future also comes with a sort of Facebook that you can't walk away from - you're continually making status updates to your friends whether you want to or not. So unless you want them to think something's up with you, you need to go to church, bible study groups, and basically act normal. Big brother exists and he's your friends.

It was generally a really cool session, but one bit that I really liked:<br/><br/>We'd abandoned our village, as angry bikers encroached upon it. We fled to the village of the Water People, and asked for amnesty. They let us join their village, on certain conditions. We started to explore the area, and noticed: a large pile of human bones, on the outskirts of town; an old hermit who lived a few miles out of town, in the opposite direction. Spooky. I suggested we were unsafe here, but Kaleigh thought we should investigate further before taking drastic action.<br/><br/>The next card we drew from the deck is "Introduce a suspicious situation," and it was my card. So I introduced that the Water People refused to talk about the bones, or about the hermit. Kaleigh's next project was to investigate the bone pile, to figure out WTF. I worked constantly on that project, finishing it up in rapid order. With the investigation project finished, it was time to reveal some answers. Except... neither of us had planned any. We were both just introducing neat stuff.<br/><br/>And then it dawned on us: the bones had clearly been flayed clean. These people had been killed and eaten. The Water People, who had just accepted us into their community, were reformed cannibals. They had other food sources now, but once upon a time they'd eaten their own to get by. Which explains why the hermit left town and never came back. Uh... yikes. Winter was approaching, and we didn't have very much in the way of food stores.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324862/#Comment_324862" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T00:28:01+00:00" title="May 17, 2011 12:28AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FLGS hosted Rich and I.

Showed them what the Tilt table is, clued them on on how the Aftermath works.<br/><br/>Next game.<br/><br/>New people showed up, moved on to Remember Tomorrow.  Four players again, got through the set-up and one "Deal" and one "Face-Off".  Told them how the game continues, but they decided (as no one else had shown up by this point) that they would continue playing.  Two of the characters checked all three boxes, the other two had two boxes checked when they stopped two hours later.<br/><br/>They invented a new type of scene, all on their own.  They couldn't have their Characters make deals with other Characters, so they would get into a "Face-Off" and make demands of each other, and then both agree to the demands.  No dice.  We started calling them "Hand-Shakes."  It only happened around three times, so it wasn't jarring, but kudos for them for seeing a new system, learning the rules, and then finding a way to create something out of the box.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324875/#Comment_324875" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T04:39:38+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  4:39AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco, playtesting Dan's new playset, The Penthouse.

Swampy Padfoot had already run all through the cave and saw everything an eye could see, but there was no sign of the key that Judy wanted.  Asha Parasol and Maquette wondered if there were some secret passage, but instead came upon several statues, beautiful and delicate, which Judy had long ago said were from before the time of Punch, the Maker-Killer.<br/><br/>Perhaps Punch or his boys had hidden the key inside one of them?  Maquette was strong, and could lift them overhead and smash them to the ground, but knew that such a thing would make Judy very very sad, and that was the last thing any of them wanted.  And so Maquette was lost in the sadness of his decision for a moment.<br/><br/>Just then Grief approached the cave.  He was one of Punch's Boys, a murderous puppet crafted from human flesh and capable of killing sad puppets without question.  Splotch Flaggy was always sad, for such was his nature, and he hid away as Grief entered the cave.  Grief closed the cave after him, using a gate that had been hidden, and Splotch was stuck outside.<br/><br/>Grief went in and first came across Swampy Padfoot, as the little finger puppet darted around and bounced and distracted Grief, but Grief decided to pay him no mind, knowing that Swampy Padfoot had known no sadness.  Grief's eyes came then to Asha Parasol, and he could see her fear at his Flesh.  Asha Parasol had heard the metal of the gate closing earlier, and knew she must go and find Splotch Flaggy, and so she turned invisible before Grief's eyes and slipped away.<br/><br/>Grief paid her no mind and turned instead to Maquette, who was lost in the sadness of his decision, not wanting to dissapoint Judy, unsure if he should destroy something so beautiful just to see if the key might be inside it.  Grief moved in close and unfurled his flesh like a great cloak, casting darkness all around Maquette, sapping his strength and slowing him into the finality of death.  Swampy Padfoot leapt around trying to distract Grief and cheer Maquette.<br/><br/>Just then Splotch Flaggy entered the cave, having been let in by Asha Parasol.  Splotch Flaggy came to Grief to attack him, and Grief's flesh shrunk back away from Maquette, who's small sadness was nothing compared deep sadness of Splotch Flaggy.  Splotch Flaggy found Grief's bat-like flesh stretch around him.<br/><br/>Maquette grabbed the beautiful statue and lifted it high, intending to smash it upon Grief's head so they could all run away, holding out hope that the key might be inside, or that Grief himself held it...<br/><br/>But at that moment, the puppets felt their limbs slow, and their strengh waned.  Darkness crept in to their eyes, darker and the cave around them, darker than the night, drawing them to sleep, and their bodies softly fell to the floor and dissapeared.<br/><br/>Their tale was not over, but for the moment they all rested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325854/#Comment_325854" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T10:39:53+00:00" title="May 23, 2011 10:39AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Harlequin</cite>Splotch Flaggy came to Grief to attack him</blockquote>Hoping to gobble him up, actually!
