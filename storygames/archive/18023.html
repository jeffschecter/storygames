This was one of the player's first ever RPG, and she really enjoyed it, and got excited about running a game for her house. Thanks to Valentine's Day and the excitement of one of the other players, it looks like she might be running Hollow Earth Expedition. She wanted some prep and experience, so we suggested trading one shots around the table for a few weeks.<br/>We already have a game of Hollow Earth, Wushu, Unknown Armies and possibly a new from scratch system one of the others is bringing...<br/><br/>The only problem is I am trying to decide between Monsterhearts, Dogs in the Vineyard, Fiasco, 13th Age or Don't Rest Your Head...<br/>But since I am in such a quandary, I figured I might aswell just throw out all of my considerations.<br/>You have one session in which to show off all a game can do to a group of friends and you want it to bring out all that is awesome about it. What game do you run and how?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407080/#Comment_407080" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T10:32:07+00:00" title="February 24, 2013 10:32AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More detail please :-)<br/><br/>How long are your sessions?

Because you could run nearly any game as a one-shot.  (Some work best in a lengthier situation, but it still can be managed.)<br/><br/>If you're asking what we specifically would play in such a situation, I can say with certainty that I'd run: <br/>Fiasco<br/>World of Dungeons<br/>Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple<br/>Perfect Unrevised<br/>Inspectres<br/>Ocean<br/>The Shab Al-Hiri Roach<br/>Lacuna<br/>Hillfolk<br/>The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen<br/>Bloody Forks of the Ohio<br/><br/>and a half dozen or so playtests of games I wrote.  I've been running a weekly indie games one-shot for several months and that is what we've played.  Most successful for us were Fiasco, Perfect, InSpectres and some of the games I made.  <br/><br/>But what works best for your group is likely to be different.

It'll go down well no matter what, especially if you find the right playset.<br/>Monsterhearts: Most of the Scion game was made up of teenage angst and bristling sexuality. Mcdaldno brings up an interesting point in how they would deal with it in a serious game though, even if just for a one shot.<br/>Apocalypse World: I really like it, I own it, I can't believe I didn't consider it! Does have the more serious sexual bent that Monsterhearts does and therefore maybe the same issues... Not sure. WIll have to ponder.<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard: Honestly I have been gagging to run this for ages, and I'm pretty glad to hear a lot of people say it works well at one shots. Whether I could get everyone to buy into it, I dunno, but I certainly hope so. I think I will bring it up with the group, as I don't think I have broached the 'Do you like westerns?' question with them yet.<br/>Don't Rest Your Head works well at one shots as I've run it before. The disadvantage is that, well, I've run it before.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel: I actually haven't run it before, I think one of the others might own the book, too...<br/>Carnage Amongst the Stars and Lady Blackbird are both games I don't own copies of, and despite meaning to buy them (especially at the latter), haven't had a chance yet. They might be worth picking up, so I shall certainly do my research.<br/><br/>Do I considered, but with one of the other games being Wushu (Most likely with an Avatar: TLA kind of slant, I should have been more clear on that), I shied away slightly from another Asian setting-inspired game. <br/>Perfect, Unrevised I wasn't even aware was a thing but it sounds awesome so I am going to check it out.<br/>Roach would go down a blast with the group, as would Lacuna.... <br/><br/>So many games, thankyou~                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407353/#Comment_407353" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T08:45:39+00:00" title="February 26, 2013  8:45AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2013 8:45AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unlike Monsterhearts, you could easily play a game of Apocalypse World without getting into "sexy, messy" territory. And if you do, the moves actually make it pretty easy to leave it "offscreen", if that's what the group prefers.<br/><br/>However, in my opinion the *World games are not naturally suited to a one-shot. It can work if you're good at making it work, or satisfied with a game that feels like the beginning of something bigger but doesn't reach any kind of conclusion. Especially if you use the "First Session" advice as written (as opposed to a more high-tension starting point).<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard, in my opinion, is one of the best one-shot games out there, hands down. <br/><br/>It doesn't always play out like (or feel like) a Western, though. I love playing Dogs but I'm not particularly interested in Westerns as game fiction. It's kind of its own thing, a powerful moral dilemma-driven kind play that gives you really hard decisions to make at the point of a gun. I've had lots of success playing Dogs in the Star Wars setting, for example.
