                    This is totally a 24-hour creation, first draft and all that. As I say in the LJ post linked to below, I should have been working on my Reversed Engineering entry, but this got wedged in the queue ahead of that project.<br/><br/><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/blue_labs/6976.html" rel="nofollow">Los Diablos</a><br/><br/>This hasn't been play-tested or anything else.  It is just an attempt to incorporate cards (a readily available resource) as a mechanic and in a couple meaningful ways. It is an attempt to allow players to re-stat thier characters each session and to start play quickly - and yet to have characters evolve in play.<br/><br/>It is also about controlled pacing.  The game session has a mechanically defined end.  <br/>To this end, what it is lacking is a build to crescendo in the mechanic.  As the focus suit becomes more prevalent, optimally it will have more impact.  It could be built into the narration of results, I suppose.<br/><br/>The setting was driven entirely by the mechanic and left intentionally free-form.  <br/><br/>I would be curious about how you feel about it reaching some of these goals.  What strengths and/or weaknesses you see in the mechanic.  Without playtesting, I wonder about the length of play under various sizes of groups given the number of decks. <br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Blue                </div>

                            Interesting- I'll have to give it a once-over after I've finished some work.  But I like the idea of the changing character stuff, let's see if it handles what Tony and I were talking about in that thread from the other day...                        </div>
