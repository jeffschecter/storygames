We had a good time with the session, and I thought that I would throw a brief actual play and some thoughts up here for <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">@Paul_Riddle</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a> to enjoy. It was kind of a long session, so I'm going to try to keep thing punchy. Let me know if anyone has any questions!<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Characters</span></b><br/>We had four players, three of whom were pretty familiar with the Aliens franchise. They built out the following:<br/><br/>Lt. Lopez, Officer - A gungho, overly ambitious officer from the American Midwest. He carried a battle trophy from a scrape off-planet with some Phoenix forces. Since the crew decided that they were a special ops unit of thieves, layabouts, and convicts, Lopez decided that he had been busted down to this job after going after some natives a bit viciously a few years back. Hates synthetics.<br/><br/>PFC Charlie "Disco" Smuz - A good trooper with a girl in every port. Not really much of a criminal, but a constant deserter. Preferred the flamethrower.<br/><br/>CPL Ivan "Rasputin" Siminov - An icy medic with more Russian tattoos than the other characters could count. It wasn't clear if Rasputin could actually bring folks back from the dead, but no one wanted to dispute it. Definitely a hardcore criminal.<br/><br/>AI 1538 "Gale" - The androgynous synthetic new to Bravo Squad. The last synthetic was terminated by the squad when it went haywire in the middle of a mission. Her oddly human trait? Wears wire-rimmed glasses.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Actual Play</span></b><br/>We ran the mission in the 2.5 Alpha, so the unit decided to focus on an infiltration maneuver. Bravo Squad would head directly to the dorms to get the scientists, while Gale and Boldne would take a group from Charlie Squad to bust up the command center and take control of the base. Then they rolled a 3 on the engagement roll (which I FREAKING LOVE) and everything went to shit.<br/><br/>Charlie Squad got pretty much wiped out by the tower defenses, leaving Gale and Bolden alone to break into the base. Gale pried open an air vent to get inside, but found herself without any backup... and without any access to the facility's computers.<br/><br/>Bravo Squad got pinned down by two of the three defensive units on the base, losing a few men as they waited for Gale to open the doors. Bad weather cut off all communication, so it took them a few minutes to figure out that Gale didn't have control of the base as planned. They regrouped around their assault vehicle, and dropped a smoke grenade for concealment as they blew a hole in the wall of the facility with the assault vehicles' high-powered weaponry. Lopez and Rasputin took a few folks inside, but Lopez ordered the majority of the squad (7-8 guys) to stay in the vehicle and protect their exit.<br/><br/>And that's when Disco noticed that one of the defensive squads was setting up a rocket launcher. And he took off running toward them.<br/><br/>By the time he got to them, it was too late. The rocket shot past him and hit the vehicle dead center. All seven men were lost. The officer got to mark XP. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Disco lit up the enemy squad with the rocket launcher, taking all of them out without taking much return fire. (hugely lucky VOF roll!)<br/><br/>Back inside the base, Gale dropped a few smoke grenades on the command center, and took advantage of the chaos to hack the computer and shut down the base. Then she downloaded the memory banks (+intel) and wiped the base's central computer. By the time the defensive forces realized what happened, she had cleared a path for the other squad and headed back into the air ducts.<br/><br/>Lopez sent a few men (Montoya and Vrakas) into the dorms, but they were immediately pinned down by the final defensive squad. Realizing the the tower turret was going to block reinforcements, he called in an airstrike... which managed to take down the tower, but pummeled the command center and dorms as well. So much for WY's advertised accuracy...<br/><br/>Regrouping, Rasputin, Lopez, and Disco headed into the dorms to support Montoya and Vrakas. Their engagement move came up a 7-9 this time, so while they were once again pinned down and on bad footing, they secured a tactical advantage: Disco was able to move into position with his flamethrower. <br/><br/>The defensive forces moved first, and Montoya took the brunt of a frag grenade. Vrakas caught a large piece of shrapnel in the chest. Rasputin jumped into action and saved Vrakas from going over the edge, but Montoya was too far gone. Lopez ordered him back into the fight, but he was slow to get up off the ground. <br/><br/>Disco, however, was ready to take on the defensive squad, and his first blast from the flamethrower did most of them in. And that's when the Phoenix forces showed up, knocking on their escape root with a frag grenade...<br/><br/>Gale, however, had dragged Bolden along through the tunnels to the lab. And while scrounging through a junk pile for some gear, a xenomorph tried to snatch up Bolden. Gale dropped two shots from her sidearm into its head to get its attention. When it lept at her, she grabbed a live cable and shoved it hard into the thing's head. It didn't get back up. <br/><br/>Rushing into the lab, Gale and Bolden found that it had been overrun by the creatures. The datafiles Gale was able to access revealed what WY was up to, and the facehugger attached to the Technician they were supposed to recover seemed like the ideal way to meet multiple mission objectives at the same time. Gale grabbed him, but looked up to find that the xenomorphs weren't about to let him go without a fight.<br/><br/>Back in the dorms, Lopez tied together a few flares, set them off, and threw them down the tunnel that the Phoenix forces were coming up through, hoping to frighten them off with a fake "grenade." It worked... just long enough for them to gather up the two scientists they needed and head out the northern exist (an engagement roll came up 13!). They called for their mobility transport (+mobility) and as it landed tried to make contact with Gale.<br/><br/>Back in the lab, Gale had her own use for flares. She lit up a few and threw them into the eggs she saw on the other side of the room, bolting to the exit with the Technician in tow. Unfortunately, as she hit the elevator, she noticed that Bolden hadn't kept up. He had instead slipped an fallen 30 meters back. Bolden ordered her to wait for him, but she said "I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Bolden, but some of the company's assets are more... important than others" and jammed the button to activate the lift. <br/><br/>As the lift roared upward, another xenomorph crawled through the ceiling. In such close quarters, Gale knew she didn't stand much of a chance. She punched her hand directly into the xenomorph's mouth (spending a point of overload) and smashed it against the wall, away from the Technician. As her arm melted off from the acid, she grabbed the Technician (with facehugger attached) and walked out on the roof. The base was in shambles, the lab was burning to the ground, and she could see the Bravo squad liftoff a short distance away.<br/><br/>She radioed for support... and Lopez answered. He was reluctant, but swung by to pick her up, narrowly dodging fire from a Phoenix heavy cannon that the enemy special ops squad had positioned near the dorms. With the three scientists and facehugger on the ship, they boosted to orbit and go the hell out of Dodge...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406546/#Comment_406546" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T16:51:48+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  4:51PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thoughts on the Game</span></b><br/>A few thoughts on the game:<br/><br/>1) I don't like tactical games. And I loved this game. I had a blast MCing it, and I'm going to steal the engagement move for pretty much every big fight I run in *W from now on. It's freaking perfect.<br/><br/>2) My players had a hell of a time with the VOF move at the start. It's a bit weird for people to switch from "always" 2d6+stat to xd6 on the table. It's also hard to read the table at first because it intuitively feels like the top part should be the number of dice. This might be aided by changing the numbers 1-6 to images of dice with pips for 1-6. By the end of the session, though, we all totally had this down.<br/><br/>3) We'd love to see a few more battle plans. When the unit wanted to retreat, for example, it would have been nice to have the same kind of battle plan.<br/><br/>4) The stress mechanics and wound mechanics WERE FANTASTIC. So much fun to see my players try to figure out where to mark things on the sheet. Mission accomplished!<br/><br/>5) The bonds felt a little weak at character creation, but I assume you guys are working on ways to make those more fun as the game develops.<br/><br/>Overall, I like it a lot! We might have a followup session if I can wrangle up the players again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406558/#Comment_406558" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T20:48:35+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  8:48PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NIce writeup Mark!<br/><br/>I totally agree about the tactical thing.
