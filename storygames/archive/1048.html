<p>Okay, so I'm trying to streamline the system for Misery Bubblegum and ... well, lemme set the stage.</p>
<p>I want a system <em>like</em> fanmail, but different in the sense that it (a) gives the people you reward power over <em>specifically you</em> and (b) rewarding another person also empowers you, the player.</p>
<p>The current best idea I have is this:  You start with a pool of (say) eight dice in your own distinctive color.  You can give a die to someone, like fanmail, and they know forever that it's yours because it's your color.</p>
<p>Now how does this empower you?  Well, my take on the idea is that you can grab dice from somewhere (about which, more later) and roll them, as long as you aren't holding more than eight of your own dice, grand total.  So if you've got eight dice (i.e. you haven't rewarded anyone) then you cannot roll any of your dice (though you can roll things that others reward you with).  But if you've given away all your dice then you can roll up to eight.</p>
<p>See how it gets a little zen?</p>
<p>Now my question is:  How do I <strong>handle</strong> this in the most intuitive way?</p>
<p>Because, right now, this requires (a) people to do subtraction, which isn't all that hard but if I can avoid it that would be cool and (b) people to always have a bowl of dice in their color on-hand, in order to draw from.</p>
<p>I would like people to be able to pick up their pool of dice and wander around.  I would like a game that could be run at a cocktail party, not requiring people to all cluster around a table full of props.</p>
<p>Right now I've got what I think of as a "two-pocket" solution.  You keep your working dice (the eight-or-less in your own color and any that people have given you) in one pocket, and a generous handful of your own color in another pocket).  Does anyone have a way to bring that complexity down to something even more manageable?</p>
<p>Side-note:  What would it imply if, for instance, there were two distinct <em>modes</em> of the rules.  When you're sitting down with the GM (and the bowl of spare dice) you can roll the dice that you do not have (presumably against conflicts mostly external to the group of protagonists) but while you're wandering around having side chats with people you can only roll the dice that you do have (presumably against conflicts internal to the group of protagonists)?  That would reduce down to a one-pocket solution, especially if feedback from conflicts was by dice-trading (crediting Vincent for NAStW and Andrew Morris for Unistat).</p>
<p>Does someone have something more elegant?</p>

<p>If you don't mind a little bit extra tokens, add poker chips or the good ol' beads. Then I give you my green die, and get a red bead (your colour) back. Now I can track easily how many dice I "don't have", as well as who is indebted to me for them. A whole potential economy of IOUs could spring from that.</p>

                            Unless I'm misreading, Tony, couldn't you cut down the handling and clutter by using player-specific tokens (glass beads, poker chips) and having one set of dice easily accessible to all?  Eight dice take up a lot of room.  <br/><br/>That said, I love the idea of the traveling minigame, where you stock up on dice before you depart from the safety of the table somehow.  Leaving some behind would have to be advantageous somehow - take just what you need for the excursion, but don't you dare take a die more...                        </div>

                            Well, how about every time you give one of your eight dice away, you get to take one of those other dice and add it to your active dice?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm not understanding something, though, so here's a bit more concretely what I mean. <br/><br/>I have eight red dice which are my Gift dice.<br/>I have X amount of blue dice which are my regular dice.<br/>There is a pool of pink dice which are Karma dice, that you roll when you have given away your Gift dice.<br/><br/>Whenever I give one of my red dice to someone else, I take a pink die and add it to my pile of blue (regular) dice. Since I only ever do this when I give away one of my eight dice, I always have the right number of pink dice in my regular die pool.<br/><br/>If there are situations where I can't use those Karma dice, it's easy to figure out because they're a different colour. Same if I need to take them back out. This way I don't need to grab those extra dice every time I want to roll them -- I just keep them with me at all times.<br/><br/>Edit: I do think I misread somehow, but just in case I am leaving this here for now.                        </div>

If a player can only roll the dice they "don't have", then why do they start the game with dice? Maybe players should start with no dice and then they are <i>given</i> (their?) dice as fanmail by other players. This method might not even require that players have their own dice color.                        </div>

<p>JBR:  I ... dunno.  Dice trading has this whole "equality" thing built in pretty heavily.  I'm inclined to want "X gives Y a fanmail" to be different from "Y gives X a fanmail."  Thoughts on how I can make that unequal with a dice trading mechanic?</p>
<p>cpeterso:  Okay, so if people have no dice of their own, they still need to be holding a pool of dice that they can use to give other people fanmail, right?  How does reducing that pool (by giving fanmail) also empower them?</p>

I give you a d10.  You give me a d4.<br/><br/>Alternately, it's not necessarily a 'trade'.  If I'm already going to get a die-up bonus from gifting somebody else with a die, does it matter if I grab it from a bowl or the somebody else gives it to me?                        </div>

<p>JBR:  You wierdos with your freaky 37.5-sided dice.  I blame Vincent for opening this unholy door once again.  A die has six sides, and is a small cube.  <em>Real dice</em> have pips, not numbers.</p>

                            Tony, maybe I'm not understanding what you're looking for, so let me state my understanding of what you're looking for, by an example.<br/><br/>I start with 8 red dice. You start with 8 blue dice. Nick starts with 8 green dice. At this point, no one can roll dice. I give 2 of my red dice to you, and 3 to Nick. Now I can roll 5 dice, right? If that's the case, just have a generic die color, say black. So, when I give you the 2 red dice, I grab 2 black dice. Then, when I give the 3 dice to Nick, I take 3 more black dice from the common pool. Now I can clearly see that I've given out 5 dice total by looking at how many black dice I have. How's that? Did I completely misunderstand?                        </div>

<p>No, Andrew, I think you've mostly got it, except a few things.</p>
<p>One:  I'm sure I'll let them roll ... y'know ... <em>something</em> even before they give out their fanmail.  It'll just be a crippled little mockery of what they can do once they get engaged in the rules.</p>
<p>Two:  When you roll the dice you don't have, you get those dice.  So now you don't ... uh ... you don't don't have as many.  You have less not-dice.  Uh.</p>
<p>Example:  If you have three dice (and therefore can roll five) and you roll three then you end up with six dice (and therefore can roll up to two more).</p>
<p>Okay.  Damn.  This is really getting too mind-bending to even contemplate.  Clearly too mind-bending to put into a game.</p>
<p>Thanks folks!  You've proven an invaluable proving ground for pointing out to me that I need to try to drive the idea in different directions.</p>
<p>I think I probably will look at the "different rules at the table and away from the table" thing, so as to set up two interlocked economies.  In the meantime, again, my gratitude for your help!</p>

                            Tony, to slash wildly at your Gordian knot here: Have you considered playing cards? They<br/>
<br/>
1) can be used to generate semi-random numbers standing, sitting, or crawling as long as you have one hand free to hold them, backs out, and the other player has one hand free to "pick a card, any card", with no need for a flat surface<br/>
2) are coded with instantly recognizable symbology into four groups<br/>
3) come in affordable packs which can be distinguished from each other by different back designs, providing a theoretically infinite number of instantly recognizable groups<br/>
4) are used in games on a daily basis by vastly more people than are familiar with using dice<br/>
[edited to add:] 5) are literally covered with culturally laden iconography, including HUMAN FACES, instead of just numbers<br/>
<br/>
I'm increasingly convincing myself to jettison dice altogether as another vestige of wargaming along with "to hit" numbers and damage ratings.                        </div>

                            Sydney, I half agree. The half of me that agrees is the half that thinks other non-dice randomizers like cards and dominoes are fun, evocative, and offer new and exciting possibilities. The half that disagrees is aware that dice, too, are ancient - plus they are a lot of fun to roll.<br/><br/>Personally I'm going for a both/and approach.<br/><br/>Also, Tony, just because your idea is too complicated as originally stated doesn't mean that there isn't a germ of goodness in there (I'm sure you already know this). It could be what Edward de Bono calls an "intermediate impossible" - something that doesn't work, but is an essential step in getting to an idea that does work.<br/><br/>Personally I like the idea of everyone having their own coloured dice and giving them to each other to represent relationship, trust, delegation or whatever.                        </div>

                            I do like this idea. I also like Sydney's idea of playing cards. It becomes interesting if the rules state that you need to draw a card from someone <i>else's</i> hand to produce a random result. So you have to give cards away in order to be able to draw a card.<br/><br/>The mechanics for Too Much Rock For One Hand use playing cards and they're so versatile.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

Have a character sheet with eight circles. At the beginning of your game, put your dice on the circles. <br/><br/>Everytime you give a die away, you can store a die which you can roll.                        </div>

                            Call the gifted dice "love notes" if you want them to sound like fanmail.<br/><br/>As part of character creation, people have to give away a few dice from their hands, 3 or so. This sets up initial relationships among the characters. Players only roll dice that are not their own color.<br/><br/>A player can call for "pity" dice to borrow a few from a player for one roll if they didn't get any from creation. (Pity dates. Awful stuff.)<br/><br/>If you don't do this, I swear I will.                        </div>

<p>Russell:  Hard-core.  You can only roll your Fan-Mail?  No resources but those people give you?</p>
<p>I'll mull that.  It would need to go along with some pretty powerful flagging so that people who were desperate could pursue Fan-Mail (at the cost of their souls, of course).</p>

                            I have a similar thing going in City of Masks, where you "woo" other characters so that they will later "lend their Face" (resource) to you when you are in a conflict. I didn't push it quite so far as this, though; you do have Face of your own.<br/><br/>What kind of setting could it be where you can only use other people's resources? I'd be fascinated to see any ideas.                        </div>

                            Curse you Tony!<br/><br/>I keep drifting back to this mechanic while writing Contract Work. <br/><br/>Having the players give up dice to others at the start not only determines the opening relationships but also sets up the pecking order. Guy with the most dice is the most popular kid in school!<br/><br/>If players can give dice away that aren't their own the cross relationship drama increases tremendously. <br/><br/>Jerry: "Y'know Kim, I hear that Bobby likes you. He almost asked you out after the game on Sunday." *hands over one of Bobby's dice.*<br/><br/>Later that same night; Jerry: "Hey Alex, you know Bobby? Well he's kind of "curious" if you get my drift. I saw him eyeing you up in the locker room after football." *Hands over one of Bobby's dice.*<br/><br/>Bobby now has to choose to reject the relationships that have been attached to him (take his dice back maybe?) or roll with them. Ultimately the player decides what is true about himself, but others can start rumors to inspire ideas.                        </div>
