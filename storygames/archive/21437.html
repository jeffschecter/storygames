It's not that there isn't story-oriented cool mechanics in there. Inspiration works if you get the whole deal, though I agree that for some people the rule explanation won't be enough and may feel disconnected from the rest of mechanics. It's good that most mechanics and things in the setting are now disconnected from the old alignment mechanic since now you can add a wider range of stories and motivations into the monsters and NPCs.<br/><br/>But I still feel like the whole deal is more OSR oriented than story-oriented if by the later you mean that characters stories will have more weight than the things that the system is pushing to happen. And that's okay. The game isn't trying to be a full fledged story-game. It's really a somewhat streamlined OSR with story-oriented sauce, not to be mistaken by anything else and does good in this department.<br/><br/>Things I noticed as a 5e D&amp;D DM:<br/><br/><b>a) It pays to be prepared.</b> Not that you can't improvise things, roll a few random tables and flip a fee pages back and forth at the table to get the stats and rules you need. But it pays to take at least a couple or months to prepare all sort of things in advance like dungeons, custom monsters, interesting NPCs, treasure, grab som pics from the web (google concept art of any enviroment, monster or NPC you would like to use, it helps a lot to improve your descriptions and for inspiration). Don't prepare stories nor solutions! Prepare the world, maybe as much as a couple of events and twists, but leave to the players to find their own solutions to thing, to make their own path and to write the story.<br/><br/>I'd have liked to prep a lot more, but it takes a time I no longer have at my dispossal, so consider this before you jump into a campaign. Even reading pre-made modules weeks before the game pays a lot. So, if you want to enjoy the game, be prepared!<br/><br/><b>b) It pays to have a really good memory.</b> Streamlined as it is, it still requires a lot of study and memorization to use the whole books correctly. Of course, you can just deal with the core rules that aren't really complex and leave players to handle the PC's class features themselves, you can use monsters as needed and not even write down their stats. But if you want to play NPC spellcasters or give them some other class it certainly pays a lot to have experience with them, perhaps to the point that you're better playing as much classes as you can to get familiar with their options and then DMing them. Otherwise it becomes a bit of a chore to study and create a personalized spell list, which by the way, it may be hard to weight into a balanced encounter.<br/><br/><b>c) It pays to be a bit of a number-oriented person.</b> Sure, the math isn't really complex here and the worst of it is in the encounter balance whole deal, for which you can find cool online calculators. The calculations however are never precise and may be a bit troublesome to get right at lower levels, when a few points off or a miscalculated enviromental danger might be the difference between a tpk or a boring encounter. Not that there aren't solutions that doesn't require number crunching but if you can dance with the numbers without really paying them too much attention (unlike me) you will have more attention span for the things that matter more, like bringing the whole thing into life.<br/><br/>Now, the main reason the things listed above pay so much is that otherwise the game is a bit slow and frequently interrupted. Even then, not to the point that it makes it a bad experience at all, but enough that I couldn't really say anything to the players that were distracted with their cellphones and later with their tablets waiting for their turn or for others to find the rules they were looking for. Or for the GM to bring up the proper stats for whatever the fiction demanded. <br/><br/>My prep saved me sometimes and my impro skills saved me at others. Even players themselves and mount-witching questions to them did the deal here and there, but in the end those interruptions and stall-threatening moments took their toll on my nerves. In my old days I could have done with some smoke and mirrors, illusionism and quantum golems, but I promised myself I wouldn't go down that alley anymore. Even though my group of players is completely ok with it and has never felt like I made their choices inconsequential when I told them what I did, I'm not confortable with that anymore and so I tried to DM with internal fairness. <br/><br/>I didn't enjoyed the whole experience too much, players had fun though it wasn't one of our best campaigns. Had to rush the ending a bit because after one year of playing (once every two weeks with a few interruptions) some were starting to get bored and frustrated and I was starting to get a bit burned out as a GM. But at least now I'm sure it's not because the way the game is made, but because of me.<br/><br/>Would I repeat the experience? Maybe, in time. Perhaps I'll try playing a few more classes to get the hang of it, prep a lot more, study the spells and the system a lot more before ever getting near it again. And definitely never play again for so long, or at least make more episodic arcs instead of a full fledged sandbox until 20th level (we barely made it into level 10 this time)<br/><br/>Sorry for the rant, though I hope any of this helps someone to decide if this is the game for them or if they should really try to twist and mod it for specific purposes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469175/#Comment_469175" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-22T13:25:34+00:00" title="January 22, 2018  1:25PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to be flippant, but wouldn't the idea that 5th edition could even be in the same ballpark with a story game be something you'd only hear from somebody who doesn't even know what a story game is? That is, I can see life-long D&amp;D enthusiasts celebrating 5th edition as a great story-oriented edition of the game, but what they'd mean by that wouldn't be <i>anything</i> like what you see out in the wild, beyond the confines of the D&amp;D brand.<br/><br/>I've seen people be enthusiastic about 5th edition, but I can't really see any meaningful difference from the 3rd edition myself. This is probably because the differences are all skin-deep, merely mechanical details implemented differently. The creative agenda, the spirit of the game if you will, is the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469177/#Comment_469177" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-22T15:33:15+00:00" title="January 22, 2018  3:33PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21401/a-thought-on-making-osr-games-more-story-based#latest" rel="nofollow">"A thought on making osr games more story based"</a> despite ultimately being about something else, reminded me of this idea. It wasn't the first time I heard or thought of this: the first time I played D&amp;D it was 3.5 and our DM started directing it as a wonderful story-centered power fantasy that I mistakenly thought was what D&amp;D was really about.<br/><br/>Later the DM decided to take the gloves off and go full OSR without telling us in advance and started to be a dick with the rules. So I started to read more into the rules and got more and more frustrated, because in those days, the term OSR didn't even existed and I had no way to know that D&amp;D was something else entirely. It was mostly the DM's fault but it took me years and lots of reading to finally realize OSR was cool and nothing was wrong with D&amp;D. It was just that I got tricked (and tricked myself too) into having different expectations about the game.<br/><br/>The thing is that, D&amp;D has changed. It was easier to understand by reading Moldvay. Then it was like a... uh, forgive me for the weird and sort of incongruent expression but I hope the feeling I got then gets through: I felt that then D&amp;D was like a story game about short-lived adventurers thriving for loot in dark, cramped places full of weird monsters, lost in distant mysterious places. I felt that if you kept things as simple as that then the game did it's work perfectly. <br/><br/>Of course, every character could have their own reasons to go after a particular type of loot and once you get the basics of the system it can be used for plenty more. But I feel that the problem started when people tried to ask more from the game and forgot which was the basic premise. Everyone started to put their own expectations on the game and mod the hell out of it. Because they wanted different stories.<br/><br/>Its like, since 3.0 or 3.5 there was a need for characters to stand more punishment, to recover faster in order to stay longer in the story. XP for dead monsters got more important than XP for gold and just because of that you get a somewhat different game: now smartly bypassing challenges isn't rewarded nor considered a waste of resources, but a waste of valuable XP. The classes got more and more features in some kind of race for more agency.<br/><br/>Now 5e has inherited part of that, but streamlined as a reaction to avoid the endless combats of 4e. It's walked back a lot to OSR, but it definitely doesn't want to get rid of the new story premise: the PCs are adventurers fighting monsters for loot and to become more powerful, in distant and mysterious lands... already seen in other editions. I'm ok with it. I like that I can keep things in low level with high lethality or play higher levels with a more power-fantasy and story variation. I just hope that I could someday get the skillset needed to make the game sing properly.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd admit that the game hasn't gotten actually "better" from one edition to another, it's just different because the audience's expectations have changed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469179/#Comment_469179" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-22T16:10:24+00:00" title="January 22, 2018  4:10PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I very much agree with your points, that's what D&amp;D is like. I particularly find your anecdote about the GM who switches playstyles in the middle emblematic of what the game, and arguably, tradition of roleplaying in general, is about: it's Gary Gygax's <i>Master of the Game</i> all over, round and round. It is something that is only possible for a rpg culture that believes both:<br/><b>a)</b> There's a One True Way of roleplaying, and therefore any changes you make to the game can only be calibrations towards further perfection. You don't get a choice about what <i>kind</i> of game to play, per se. You can only realize the one truth in a deeper way.<br/><b>b)</b> The GM is the font of creative choice. Players are only there to be subjected to what he does. No need to explain, discuss or agree to anything.<br/><br/>And yeah, Basic D&amp;D (all editions, I don't care) is so very much a better game than what AD&amp;D ultimately became that it's not even funny. One is perhaps the most creatively coherent rpg text of the 20th century, the other is the stronghold of monolithic "let's be everything for everybody" thinking.<br/><br/>You can read what D&amp;D is in terms of "story", but I don't think that is the most natural way to interpret what goes on in its history. It's sort of an ironic distance: you say that Moldway is about <i>stories of</i> dungeon delving, I say it's about dungeon delving per se [grin]. Not that story didn't become an important concept of D&amp;D creativity over time, but it's not the whole story, pun intended.<br/><br/>Modern D&amp;D (3rd edition onwards) is pretty clearly a story game in the sense that it has become self-referential: where old school D&amp;D was a wargame and 2nd edition was predominantly a story game of high fantasy (drawing its inspiration and promising an epic fantasy adventure experience), 3rd edition became the story of Dungeons &amp; Dragons above other things: it is a simulation of what old school D&amp;D used to be like (or rather, what it romantically was imagined to be). That is also what 5th edition most naturally does: simulating old school D&amp;D as a safer and more measured experience. This is what I mean when I say that 5th edition is really similar to 3rd: they're both game texts that answer questions like "Hey, what kind of magic items should a 4th level party possess for it to be an authentic D&amp;D experience?"<br/><br/>Commercial D&amp;D having become entire self-referential has had a major impact on the kind of fiction it presents to us: it has no need for artistic, cultural, historical relevance. It's the same kind of creative sterility as the one you witness in say the re-iterating <i>Star Trek</i> franchise, with its only measure of success being its ability to rearrange the same lego blocks over and over.<br/><br/>So yeah, I like to gripe about D&amp;D, too, on a cold winter day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469180/#Comment_469180" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-22T16:24:07+00:00" title="January 22, 2018  4:24PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, who doesn't.

It's also trying to be "self-referential" when it comes to playstyle, mechanics, and procedures.<br/><br/>For instance, I can see absolutely NO reason for mismatches like these other than a desire for a self-referential recreation of familiar elements of past D&amp;D:<br/><br/>* A D&amp;D5 character is supposed to be a cool, competent and fully-realized hero, to match the player's vision of their awesome avatar.<br/>* The character races, classes, XP rules, challenge ratings, and other rules all strive for a "perfect balance", in terms of challenge, power level, and available options.<br/>* Almost every roll you make and everything you do in the game is (quite intentionally) designed so that it is always based on an ability score. Therefore, the ability score are really the key to your interaction with the game.<br/><br/>Given the above... is there any possible justification for <b>random ability score generation</b>? If the game is about portraying the hero you want, why would you roll your stats randomly? If the whole game is obsessed with careful balance... again, why would you leave the most important factor in character competence to the dice?<br/><br/>The game is full of little things like this.<br/><br/>It seems to me that D&amp;D5, while in many ways a fantastic design, and very carefully done, has so many features which exist solely to "feel familiar" to D&amp;D players.<br/><br/>There are elements of OSR-style D&amp;D, like random tables and some gaps which make space for "rulings, not rules". There is the dramatic/heroic approach to character creation, which harkens back to AD&amp;D. There are all the careful rules for movement in combat and creating an objective basis for task resolution (like 3rd Edition). Finally, there are the million "cool powers" and huge numbers available to every character which mean that being an effective player is mostly about using those "cool powers" over and over, which feels a lot like D&amp;D4. (For instance, in my game I'm a Sorcerer who carries a dagger which I can use to deal 1d4 damage. What is even the point of such a thing, when the other PCs can use Divine Smite, various Rogue special attack powers, and so forth to inflict 15-40 points of damage each time they attack? As can I, of course - even my "at will" cantrip attacks deal 2d8 or 2d10 damage. Enemies often have 100+ hit points, and we're nowhere near any kind of epic level. Actually doing something with a typical weapon like a knife or a sword seems... entirely redundant. Even "first-level" NPCs or similar monsters often have 10-15 hit points and attack twice per round.)<br/><br/>They seem to have done a great job of pleasing their audience with a million little familiar touches, throughout the game. (And there are many little, very slick turns in the ruleset, which is quite competently put together.) Finding a coherent way to play, however, seems harder than ever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469193/#Comment_469193" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-22T21:58:31+00:00" title="January 22, 2018  9:58PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, overall, with the criticism of "modern D&amp;D" (Exempting 4th Edition, which actually did its own thing and did it pretty well.)  <br/><br/>I don't really agree with the praise lavished on older D&amp;D.  It feels pretty rose colored to me.  The game was NEVER about "the story of dungeon delving" - it was almost entirely divorced from the idea of "characters" as anything but disposable figures.   And it almost immediately started going off the rails as various people almost immediately wanted it to do different things (All the people who had read, oh, say, Lord of the Rings, and NOT all the Sword and Sorcery stuff that inspired the "lets raid dungeons for gold like good, self serving heroes" stuff that the game was initially about)<br/><br/>I feel like the OSR movement's greatest achievement is SALVAGING a playstyle out of the wreck of early D&amp;D.  It's probably even a playstyle that hews pretty close to the original INTENT of D&amp;D.   But it's not what D&amp;D was, and I think acting to the contrary is to give too much credit to the creators of the game.  Yes, they are deserving of a good chunk of credit, but not nearly as much as they usually get.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469195/#Comment_469195" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-22T22:23:45+00:00" title="January 22, 2018 10:23PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've read many of those original texts. Here's my takes on a few of them:<br/><br/><b>The original '74 booklets</b> are brimming in energy, and their creative agenda is very clear: it's a commando skirmish wargame in a dungeon setting, with one player acting as a "fiendish trapmaster" sort of figure while also being the referee. The technical process of play is very clear. It doesn't fully explain the entire breadth and width of wargaming philosophy, but that's because it was written in the cultural context of that hobby.<br/><br/><b>The Mentzer red box</b>, at the other end of Basic D&amp;D development, is very explicit and clear about the procedures of how to play the game. It uses somewhat inexact language about the reasons of why you do things the way you do them, but it's rarely wrong about what you should actually do. It supports you as much as game text possibly can, and its only incoherence is in not knowing what to compare itself against (or being unwilling to waste verbiage on complaining about Runequest).<br/><br/><b>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> is an ambitious mess. It's a snapshot of a campaign, forced into the format of a rulebook. It's modestly clear in what it's supposed to be, but it's also got a lot of bad advice on how to go about achieving its goals. It's more technically wonky than philosophically, if you will. It is "Advanced" only in the sense that you shouldn't try to use it unless you're proficient with D&amp;D.<br/><br/><b>Keep on the Borderlands</b> is brilliant. If I was forced to reconstruct D&amp;D out of a limited textual corpus, with no cultural transmission to back me up, I'd go with KotB + the original booklets as the basis. The end result would include everything you need for a coherent wargame sort of D&amp;D. It is impossible to read KotB and not understand what a challenge-based game oriented towards player responsibility and strategic choice is like.<br/><br/>I do not think that it takes excessive imagination to see the game that OSR on the whole claims to see in these texts. It's true that the OSR scene is inclined towards a certain type of D&amp;D, but that's also roughly-speaking the type of D&amp;D that the above four texts, among others, teach. You can reinterpret those texts to apply to different kinds of play, but I think that when you read them as a whole, they're either bad story games or good wargames, and that should be taken into account: if you're reading charitably, then you should have no problem reading the books in a way that makes sense.<br/><br/>That aside, I don't disagree about people playing games any which way from the start; it's been amply demonstrated that already in the '70s people were doing all sorts of experimental stuff with D&amp;D as their starting point. Good for them, but that doesn't mean that the game texts, or the games they try to capture, are themselves vague or meaningless. If anything, it's a wonder how such clarity could develop into the platitude-filled vagueness familiar from the traditional games of the '80s and '90s.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469196/#Comment_469196" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-22T22:28:22+00:00" title="January 22, 2018 10:28PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2018 11:07PM by WarriorMonk.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agree on both last posts. Though I'd just like to point out that I wrote: "Then it was like a... uh, forgive me for the weird and sort of incongruent expression but I hope the feeling I got then gets through: I felt that then D&amp;D was like a story game about short-lived adventurers thriving for loot in dark, cramped places full of weird monsters, lost in distant mysterious places. I felt that if you kept things as simple as that then the game did it's work perfectly."<br/><br/>Most probably what I meant got lost in the translation, what I wanted to say was that -and I'm not really saying that Moldway D&amp;D is a story game- but if you see it as a game that is supposed to produce a particular type of story and don't mistake it for Tolkien-like stuff, the game does it's work. I'd like to take back that "...perfectly" though.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>Also, the roleplaying part is actually barely mentioned in the book rules or procedures. Most of the so called "roleplaying" is either in the Inspiration rule or problem-solving related, hence you will only probably see some good roleplaying if the players have learn it from somewhere else. I've got to search more about it on the book but so far neither the PHB nor the DMG says much about how players should portray the personality of their characters. There's some advice for the NPCs and villains and some examples, but not enough. It's sadly just not the focus of the game at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469197/#Comment_469197" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-22T23:02:24+00:00" title="January 22, 2018 11:02PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I don't really agree with the praise lavished on older D&amp;D.  It feels pretty rose colored to me.  The game was NEVER about "the story of dungeon delving" - it was almost entirely divorced from the idea of "characters" as anything but disposable figures.   And it almost immediately started going off the rails as various people almost immediately wanted it to do different things (All the people who had read, oh, say, Lord of the Rings, and NOT all the Sword and Sorcery stuff that inspired the "lets raid dungeons for gold like good, self serving heroes" stuff that the game was initially about)<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI can say that, for me and many of my friends, D&amp;D was ultimately a disappointment because we *wanted* to do <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, and ran into exactly the trouble you're describing.<br/><br/>Returning to early D&amp;D through the lens of an OSR-like mindset (seeing it as colourful wargame where the fictional concerns of these characters become the strategic battleground) finally made D&amp;D, as written, make sense.<br/><br/>So I feel fairly confident saying that none of us were "looking through rose-coloured glasses". If anything, our assumptions and experiences predisposed us *against* D&amp;D, but it turns out that, hey, the game is really fun!<br/><br/>It's certainly not a "story game" in any sense - your description, including characters as "disposable figures", describes it pretty well, in my opinion. Seeing that as a feature and not a bug is what makes the game enjoyable, for me.<br/><br/>To bring it back to the topic at hand, that's one of many places where subsequent editions of D&amp;D lost it, for me. (I can't entirely blame the authors - they may have been doing the best they could with what they knew - but it's certainly not terribly appealing to me as a gamer with so many other great options at my fingertips.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469220/#Comment_469220" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-23T17:14:18+00:00" title="January 23, 2018  5:14PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll have to go find my original Mentzer books, because I definitely DID NOT get a sense of the PURPOSE of play from those books.  I feel like there was already the whole "It's a WORLD OF ADVENTURE!" vibe going on instead of the "No, really, it's just going to be a bunch of disposable dudes going into a deathtrap dungeon." thing.<br/><br/>In fact, I don't know anyone who started these games in the Mentzer/AD&amp;D era who GOT the correct process for what these games were about. <br/><br/>I'm not arguing that it can't be fun played correctly, certainly, but I'm arguing that the "rose colored glasses" are giving an unduly positive picture of how D&amp;D was ACTUALLY PLAYED.   OSR stuff tends to make a big deal of getting "back to how the game was supposed to be/'really was'".  And the first of those is correct, and the second of those is rosy pretension, IMHO, unless you were playing with Gygax, and maybe not even then.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469224/#Comment_469224" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-23T17:55:23+00:00" title="January 23, 2018  5:55PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really, I'm not even kidding - re-read those books. Sure, Mentzer portrays the game as a fun adventure game, but I think it's also very clear about what it means by that: you're going into dangerous situations and you're going to roll those dice, and there's no guarantee that it's gonna go well. Most importantly: the game does not suggest that the GM should provide a story, or that something interesting in dramatic terms is necessarily going to happen in that dungeon. It's going to be monsters and treasure, pretty much. The GM is doing their job if they provide some goblins, some gold, and impartial refereeing.<br/><br/>I was never a Mentzer kid myself, but I did read the red box, in Finnish no less, early on in my rpg career. I didn't get it <i>at all</i> - what I saw was a game of extreme inelegance and confusion. But that was because I was looking at it from an essentially traditional perspective: I was expecting <i>Runequest</i>, so of course Basic D&amp;D was ugly by those standards. To make young Eero happy the game needed to have unified resolution, complex character modeling and a clear sense of GM-provided adventure.<br/><br/>That being my context, I don't want to tell anybody that youngsters actually understood Mentzer or other Basic D&amp;D texts when they read them in isolation. I clearly didn't, and you probably didn't either. I just don't think that this is the fault of the text itself so much as it's that roleplaying is really hard, and I at least already came to the game with heavy preconceptions. Had I understood it more as akin to <i>Heroquest</i> (the boardgame), and had I not already grown bored with that years ago, I might have realized it in the competitive spirit instead of as an old-fashioned and clumsy attempt at a modern (for the times) story game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
