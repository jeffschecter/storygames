It solidified something for me which probably isn't revolutionary and new, but I am only now thinking of as a "thing." It's something I call The Box. First I'll talk about the series, then The Box.<br/><br/>The concept:<br/><br/>In the near future, genetic engineering has been perfected and is used mostly by the rich to give their children subtle, non-visible enhancements. Occasionally, when rich people get unlucky or middle-class people aren't willing to spend their life savings, there are mistakes that are visible. Our show follows a carnival and traveling freak show populated (mostly) by these mistakes.<br/><br/>The players:<br/><br/>* Henry Short played by Jeff C. Henry is an old-school little person from back in the day where you came upon your afflictions honestly. He's also the crime boss for the carnival, and wants to run the thing. He's kinda cranky but not exactly evil. We're vibing on Quasimodo here. He's in love with Jemma Davison.<br/><br/>* Ben Calder by Travis C. Ben is an undercover cop who's had some gorilla gene splicing, as most of the operatives for The Department of Genome Security do. He's been hormonally and surgically altered so that his enhancements are more visible so that he can infiltrate the carnival and uncover dirt. He's being pushed by Jemma to romance and/or liberate Sheena.<br/><br/>* Jack Daw by Joshua S. Jack has had some raven DNA put into him. He's got a fringe of feathers that crown his head, is angular, and twitchy. He's driven by greed and is the barker and manager of the carnival. This is his spotlight episode. He is in love with Sheena and also terrified of her. He leaves her secret presents of jewelry. Jack has a pet evil catmonkey.<br/><br/>* Sheena (Davison) by Krista E. Sheena has a little too much of the cat splicing she had showing, and while her mother didn't throw her out of the house, she was made to feel unwanted and the source of family shame. Sheena's a beautiful woman who thinks everyone is repulsed by her. Sheena is in love with Henry.<br/><br/>* Jemma Davison by Sandy C. Jemma wanted her daughters to become the Texas State Cheerleading Champions that she wasn't able to be. After Sheena came out wrong, she got it right with her second daughter. Her shame over what she did to both girls poisoned her relationship with Sheena and drove her from the home. She is now an influential member of the House of Representatives and a crusader against the freakshow movement.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70518/#Comment_70518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T14:03:10+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  2:03PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Show opening: Jemma calls Sheena, Sheena slams phone, looks out the window longingly to Henry, Henry giving a shiny bribe to Jack, Jack and Henry being watched by Ben, Ben calls Jemma.<br/><br/>The episode starts with Don Gustav Cornatto, a Connection of Henry's and his drug supplier, speaking on the phone to an unknown person. He confidently says, "Don't worry about the bird, I think we just got the thing to get his attention. He'll come around."<br/><br/>The "thing" is a small metal box of unknown contents. Jack walks into his office and becomes transfixed and we go into flashback, Jack's first meeting with Ben, early struggles with Henry over running the show, and Jemma getting Jack a job at the carnival, wherein we discover that the "Don" is also deputy director of the Department of Genome Security. The audience doesn't know which of his identities is a fake.<br/><br/>Eventually we cut back to modern day. We see a scene of Henry unwittingly rejecting Jemma, who also sees Henry interacting with her mother and realizes he's in love with her. She goes running to Jack because he's a good friend and will console her. Jack meanwhile finally has opened the box and discovers it is the detailed records of Jemma's appointments with her psychotherapist. He learns of her deep need to be loved and vast lack of confidence.<br/><br/>The crucial conflict of the entire game comes when Jack, finding a needy and vulnerable Sheena weeping in his arms, has to decide whether or not to seduce her. The entire table is against him and forces him to use his knowledge to psychologically coerce the longed-for lovemaking out of the girl.<br/><br/>They awaken the next morning when Henry comes stomping in to complain about something. He sees them, rushes out, and Sheena runs out after him just as the catmonkey has started playing the tapes of her sessions. She hears them start but files that away for later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70519/#Comment_70519" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T14:03:18+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  2:03PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Box<br/><br/>This is the second time I've found myself doing this: introducing a mystery element, the details of which I have absolutely no idea. It's so damned exciting, especially when you are explicit with the other players that you have no idea what's inside it. I mean, sure, McGuffins, everyone knows about them. But still this was like a revalation for me. People focus on this element and it winds up driving all kinds of other things. It's a technique I intend to continue using until people start rolling their eyes at me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70521/#Comment_70521" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T14:14:30+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  2:14PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2007 2:16PM by Robert_Bohl.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some pictures taken of character sheets and the like:<br/><br/><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/indie_insurgent/pic/00001g07/" rel="nofollow">http://pics.livejournal.com/indie_insurgent/pic/00001g07/</a><br/><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/indie_insurgent/pic/00002w14/" rel="nofollow">http://pics.livejournal.com/indie_insurgent/pic/00002w14/</a><br/><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/indie_insurgent/pic/00003yth/" rel="nofollow">http://pics.livejournal.com/indie_insurgent/pic/00003yth/</a><br/><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/indie_insurgent/pic/00004ex4/" rel="nofollow">http://pics.livejournal.com/indie_insurgent/pic/00004ex4/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70541/#Comment_70541" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T16:51:41+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  4:51PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hooray lost posts!<br/><br/>I think I frequently say this too quickly, but there's probably a mechanic here.  Given that everyone either knows what a McGuffin is (whether they've heard the name or not) or can have it easily explained to them, there should be a way to implement their use in collaborative games.<br/><br/>Perhaps certain circumstances allow a player to declare a new trait that does not contradict previous ones.  In that case, the existence of a physical box constitutes a trait, since it dictates the size of the McGuffin.  As the setting and situation is explored, players at first might declare traits like "This group seeks it, that group too."  Then if we get our hands on it they might say "It's heavy," "It glows."  They're barred from specifics, though they might have one in mind.  In fact, because of the way their brains work, they probably do have an idea, but as everyone declares traits, those ideas can (or will be forced to) shift and change.  Perhaps at the start, one player gets to establish the principle trait, whether a name, an appearance, an interest...Or maybe each player gets to declare one starting trait, for more complex mysterious artifacts.  I'm reminded of an improv game from nerdly: Two people take turns stocking a blank space with imaginary objects ("There's a Dining room table here!"  "On the table is a fetid corpse!"), then two other people do a scene with that scenery.<br/><br/>Box examples from Fiction:<br/><br/>1. The Case from <i>Ronin</i>.  "What's in it?"  "That isn't necessary [for you to know]."  "Is it heavy, is it explosive, is it chained to some unlucky bloke's wrist? Are we gonna have to chop it off? "  Several characters know what the case is, some others don't, for the purposes of the fiction, it doesn't matter, since it remains unopened throughout.<br/><br/>2. The Suitcase from <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.  "Is that it?"  "Oh yeah."  Any character may open the case to verify that the contents are a) valuable, b) stunning, and c) shining.  Beyond this, it doesn't matter, since it remains unused throughout.<br/><br/>3. The 39 Steps from...<i>The 39 Steps</i>.  "Mr. Memory!  What are the 39 steps?!"  "The 39 Steps is an organization of spies collecting information on behalf of the foreign office of...[interrupted by gunshot, collapses]"  The box is at first just a phrase, but is soon said to be a group of unclear purpose and nature.  Some characters are members of the group or targets of them.  The hero is fighting, from the very beginning, to discover and expose them, so as to clear his name, so the contents of the box are important, inasmuch as he's able to escape guilt (though probably not persecution) by discovering them.  Which he does, in the final scene, quoted above.<br/><br/>4. The Orb, from <i>Brisco County Jr.</i>  We get overloaded with details on this one.  It's a burnished sphere of little pillars that can each be removed, revealing sparklies.  It's unearthed in ancient strata.  It grants strength to the Chinese indentured servants who touch it, and strength and death to the Robber Baron who does the same.  It is sought by the Blye Gang and the US government.  It those who touch it and death to those who abuse it.  Arguably this gets a little silly as details mount without a final reveal.  It's from future of naked people!  It eats souls!  Combination Hookah and coffeemaker, also makes It makes julienne fries!  In any case, I have no idea whether it was important or not, but it sure got to be annoying not to know as time dragged on.<br/><br/>Tenatively going out on a limb: it seems like the reason that boxes remain unopened is because revelations of their contents reveal nothing more about the characters that would be emotionally relevant.  That is, we would only gain factual information about who the people seeking the box are working for or seeking to do.  The first reason I can think of why this would be necessary is to destroy moral ambiguity.  Hence, in noir, the box is best left closed, since the hero is supposed to be hard-bitten and doing the job because he was forced to by material or emotional threats, not moral ones.  There might be other reasons to eventually reveal such things beyond curiosity (which can be emotionally relevant, come to think of it and probably would be for any character I make...), but I can't think of any.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of Capes (for several reasons actually, but I'll focus on one).  Something like temporary Comics Code declarations could be implemented by people who introduce story elements for a given episode/session/series.  For example, they could dictate that the contents of the case can never be known by the audience, or that it can never even be known by the heroes.  Or that the kidnapped sister can never be dead, or can never be found.  Or that only x traits can be declared for the box ever.<br/><br/>Anyone else have any ideas?  Are there games that already do something like this?  Are there examples that shine a better light on the phenomenon?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70544/#Comment_70544" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T17:31:30+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  5:31PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like it was an amazing game!

But I have found that sometimes you can make The Box mean something very important to the character. For example, this time. Having the contents be the Apple of Knowledge essentially made extreme dramatic and character significance.<br/><br/>But I really really like the idea of making The Box a central part of the game, making a central rule for a game. There's a whole game system there, I think.<br/><br/>Dave:<br/><br/>Thanks for the compliments! There was so much that I failed to include. Hopefully the players, who I CCed on this, will comment.<br/><br/>It reminded me in a lot of ways of a game of Shock:. We introduced one science fictiony element, and stuck with pretty much just that one. That was exciting.<br/><br/>Something else of note came up in this game. Krista and I had a miscommunication in the seduction scene. My stakes (not with her, with another character) were that if I won, Jack would seduce her successfully. As in have sex with her. She thought I meant an attempt to seduce which she could turn down.<br/><br/>I insisted pretty strongly that it should be full-on sex. I argued that there was no way it would be anywhere near as emotionally devastating if he only hit on her. She agreed, but afterward I felt guilty, like I had both deprotagonized and pressured her. She said she felt ok with it and I believe her, and I think I did a pretty good job of being pretty clear about my reasons, and being persuasive rather than coercive. However it was kinda sticky (no pun intended), and very interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70688/#Comment_70688" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-20T21:40:11+00:00" title="May 20, 2007  9:40PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A whole game system!
