The idea is that theoretically I could drop the pamphlet in the laps of a group of unsuspecting people and (without outside assistance) they would be able to grasp the concepts and move on to play. <br/>\n  An issue I am facing is the mechanics I was bringing together were pretty broad so the game would take more thought to get the concepts. I am thinking I should make each pamphlet more narrowly focused so that they are easier to grasp. To help bridge the gap from pamphlet to pamphlet I am pretty sure I will use the same underlying roll method just changing the way it translates the results. <br/>\n  Right now while I ponder this all over I would like to try and look through good examples of ridiculously simple to understand games, and presentations of games as inspiration. My question to you guys is what games have you read which had simple to understand rules, and or were presented in an incredibly simple to understand way?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234038/#Comment_234038" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T07:32:24+00:00" title="September 24, 2009  7:32AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Psi Run and its Psi Mom, Otherkind<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pool_(game)" rel="nofollow">The Pool</a><br/><br/><a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/archipelago-ii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago II</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234051/#Comment_234051" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T08:37:54+00:00" title="September 24, 2009  8:37AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something you might want to keep in mind when looking through any responses you do get is that what is clear and simple for a Story Gamer might not necessarily be clear and simple to an average person in the street.<br/><br/>I can't think of many that were so incredibly simple, but Risus might not be a bad place to start looking.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
