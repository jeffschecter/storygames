So, I riped off some of the structure, etc... and made a game called <b>The Alchemist</b>. I made it playable for two people and tried a quick game tonight. It was pretty fun. I really dig this genre of games, because it really does make a story. I'd really like to see more games in this genre. I might try making a solo game based on the same concept.<br/><br/>I wrote down everything we said in game, because I wanted to see how it would sound when read back. Writing down what happened during the game really slowed it down, but it sounds pretty cool when read back. It took us about 30 minutes to play. I think it'd take half that without the writing. The goal in The Alchemist is to get seven ingredients to turn lead into gold. There are three roles in the game, the minion, the toil and the alchemist. In the two-person version, one person plays the alchemist and the toil and the other her minion. After the turn is over, they switch roles. Coin flips determine what to say. Here's the actual play from our playtest. These sentences represent what was actually said during the game. Here's a copy of <a href="http://www.emptygamebox.com/empty/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/The-Alchemist1.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Alchemist</a> in pdf.<br/><br/>The Minions are Minion Noelle and Minion Huckalot.<br/><br/>The alchemist says, "Minion Noelle get me a pickle."<br/><br/>Minion Noelle found the pickle in a barrel in an old boat shack, but the barrel is hanging from a chain 20 feet off the floor. Minion Noelle shot the chain with an arrow, the barrel dropped, burst into pieces, and Minion Noelle grabbed a pickle and ran. The alchemist says, "When the barrel hangs by a thread, use a ladder." [Coin flip: Two gold, one lead]<br/><br/>The alchemist says, "Minion Huckalot get me an exercise machine."<br/><br/>Minion Huckalot goes to the gym, but the gym was locked, so Minion Huckalot transformed to the size of a keyhole, crawled into the door, unlocked it and took an exercise machine. The alchemist says, "A gym locked makes flabby abs." [Coin flip: Two gold, one lead]<br/><br/>The alchemist says, "Minion Noelle get me pixie dust."<br/><br/>Minion Noelle found pixie dust under a mushroom in the forest in a tiny bag, but a giant caterpillar blocked the way, so Minion Noelle grew big and stepped on the caterpillar. Minion Noelle grabbed the bag and ran to the lab. The alchemist says, "When a caterpillar blocks, become cocoon." [Coin flip: Two gold, one lead]<br/><br/>The alchemist says, "Minion Huckalot get me pancakes."<br/><br/>Minion Huckalot went to Perkins and ordered a short stack, then took them without paying. The alchemist says, "Oh, Minion, these are the most delicious looking pancakes I've seen. I can't wait to slap butter on and smell the sweet smell as I add them to my potion." [Coin flip: Three gold]<br/><br/>The alchemist says, "Minion Noelle get me a newt."<br/><br/>Minion Noelle ran to Mount Saint Helens and found a newt in a gopher hole, put it in her pocket and ran back to the lab. The alchemist says, "The newt, a perfect slimy sliminess and the reddest rediness of any newt I've seen." [Coin flip: Three gold]<br/><br/>The alchemist says, "Minion Huckalot get me pool water."<br/><br/>Minion Huckalot went to Grover Cleveland's backyard to scoop water from the pool, but Cleveland rushes him with a shotgun. Minion Huckalot trips him into the pool and takes the water that splashed on his clothing. [Coin flip: Two gold, one lead]<br/><br/>The alchemist says, "Minion Noelle get me an elephant."<br/><br/>In front of the last elephant stands a fence taller than the highest fence, and Minion Noelle dug a tunnel with a backhoe, but the zoo keeper stood in her way. The alchemist says, "On my life is so hard. I can't get an elephant. Minion Noelle, you're demoted." [Coin flip: Two lead, one gold -- triggers Special Circumstance] The alchemist says, "Minion Huckalot go help Minion Noelle get me an elephant." Minion Huckalot covers the zoo keeper's eyes with a handkerchief, so Minion Noelle can get the elephant out behind him, but the cover fell off and the zoo keeper busted them. The alchemist says, "Minion Huck, you silly fool. Don't you know how to tie a knot. You're demoted!" [Coin flip: One lead, One gold]<br/><br/>The alchemist adds a pickle to the formula and it bubbles and pixie dust and it turns yellow and adds an exercise machine and it smells sweaty and adds pool water to take away the stench and adds a pancake for the fresh buttery smell and adds a newt for that oh so slimy feel. After all the ingredients mixed together, gold appeared! [More ingredients won than lost.]<br/><br/>Minion Noelle bought a new pair of shoes with your demoted half-portion. Minion Huckalot retired to a small desert island.<br/><br/>THE END                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315854/#Comment_315854" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T07:58:57+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  7:58AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!
