I want to talk about dropping their <b>with love</b> and <b>for myself</b>, which is <b>shaming</b>. <br/><br/>At Dreamation, Vincent mentioned that this consequence set exists in the larger system IaWA lives within, and said it didn't belong in the Wicked Age, and left it at that. Since many of us are playing games outside the Wicked Age, I thought maybe now's the time to bring this up for discussion. In particular, I was thinking about this during a cyberpunk-themed game I was in recently (<a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Mirrorshades_Oracle" rel="nofollow">oracle</a>).  I kept finding myself in situations that were essentially social, and I wanted to beat somebody and SHAME them. I know we could have just done that with negotiation, but here's the catch  - it seemed like conflicts that might end in SHAME were not necessarily about action but about words. <br/><br/>I know what you're thinking: "Dave, please turn to page 12, second paragraph, which you'll find clearly states 'Don't roll dice when two characters are having a conversation, no matter how heated it becomes'" We didn't. But in an age that's not as Wicked, or Wicked in a different way, I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to start rolling dice while it was still words. I know how to narrate my words to fit dice rolls; I learned it playing Dogs. <br/><br/>I can think of ways where action, not words, would result in SHAME: "I pee on you." or "I lick your wife right there in front of everybody" or whatever. That's fine, but if I'm playing James Bond IaWA or Heathers/Mean Girls/Cruel Intentions IaWA, I'm going to want scenes where a supervillain has to back down or a girl runs off crying just because I've said something that stung so bad they lost the whole conflict. So, I want to know:<br/><br/>If I'm playing in a non-Wicked Age setting, and let's say I replace "Injure" with "Shame", can I now trigger dice rolling while it's still words being passed back and forth?<br/><br/>- if your answer is "Yes":  what breaks?<br/><br/>- if your answer is "No": does that mean somebody has to get slapped or something every time I want to SHAME?<br/><br/>- if your answer is "IaWA isn't meant for what you're trying to do with it", then I'm sorry Vincent.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135306/#Comment_135306" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T22:50:43+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 10:50PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why are people so dead-set on using IAWA to do other, totally different things?<br/><br/>Is it like: I found a system that's cool and fast!

Because games exist to serve us, and can do so in many capacities? Because its fun? Because it isn't poking ourselves in the eyes with sticks? <br/><br/>Dave, <br/><br/>A couple random thoughts. Conversation doesn't have to mean social vs non social. I think Wicked often works best when "conversation" means "not forcing." Once you have decided that you are going to do something, or make someone do something, and you no longer are interested in letting them have a choice then dice are on. If you are all like "I'm going to argue and argue and argue, but at the end if they refuse nothing painful, harmful, or shattering will happen to them" then you're in a conversation, no dice. (Ditto rough housing with someone but being unwilling to actually beat them until they bleed? I dunno.) If you're like "Sure, words are my weapon, but if bitch doesn't bow down and do as he's told, he's going to end up broken as a human being by the end of the scene" then dice may well fit. <br/><br/>Cause really, its all about having dice only when the things being done are going to fit the consequences. If what you're doing can't result in the person being injured or exhausted, then what you're doing doesn't make mechanical sense as a place to be rolling dice. If you can't think how the person refusing to do what you want, or failing to stop you, won't result in them bleeding or unconscious or weeping out of control then you shouldn't be rolling dice just because what the system outcome will be won't make sense. <br/><br/>So, if your Shame is going to work at a level where you live in a social environment in which face, position, and status can literally destroy you as a human being -- then I think it could work. I think the key to it is still around the force issue. If you are trying to convince someone that not doing something could be shameful, that's a conversation. If you are going to shame them, hurt them, destroy them socially unless they do something or until they do something, then it should work. Just don't let it soften, don't let it be a weak way out. At the end of winning, you still have to have a stick with which to cow the other person, and the stick has to make sense and be just as brutal.<br/><br/>But I dunno. If you try it out, let me know how it goes in play, would ya?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135309/#Comment_135309" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T23:27:42+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 11:27PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2008 11:31PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's ignore Ben's crotchety old man shouting on the lawn, shall we?<br/><br/>Shame (I've been calling it Humiliation) is great for all kinds of stories you can do with the Anthology Engine. And you can totally roll dice while people are talking. The trigger for dice is that someone moves from trying to convince someone to <i>forcing</i> them.<br/><br/>Vincent explains it a bit <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25654.msg247189#msg247189" rel="nofollow">here</a>:\n<blockquote>If you roll dice, you're no longer trying to convince someone to do something, you're trying to make them do it. Shahu Seen isn't trying to convince Mekha to go for Tajie, he's trying to MAKE him go for Tajie.<br/><br/>So: if you want someone to do something, tell them your reasons. Maybe they'll do it, maybe they won't. But - while you're leaving it up to them, don't roll dice.<br/><br/>Rolling dice means that you don't care anymore what they want to do, or whether you've convinced them, or anything like that. It means you're holding the gun to their head and telling them what to do (whatever the gun happens to be).</blockquote>\nFor all kinds of stories, Shame makes for a great gun.<br/><br/>(Crossposted with Brand, with whom I still share the Mind Link)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135313/#Comment_135313" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T01:15:14+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  1:15AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahhh that's perfect, we just assumed that you could do this from the first game, because of comments that Vincent had made about how you could do things with words that were like weapons (blackmailing, threatening to harm loved ones and the like), but we still only had exhaust or injure as results.

The only way I could actually think about how the rules worked and what playing the game would be like was to re-imagine it as a science fiction game, or a modern-day cop game like the Vista Heights one mentioned in another thread, or...well, nearly anything else, really.  So there's that.<br/><br/>Also, sometimes you just want to try out the latest trendy cool-and-fast system on an old favorite to see if it really does work as well.  (In my experience, sometimes it does; or at least, the things that it does not-so-well are different than what the original system did not-so-well, and that can be an entertaining diversion.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135322/#Comment_135322" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T05:31:04+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  5:31AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Why are people so dead-set on using IAWA to do other, totally different things?</blockquote>\nHi Ben.
