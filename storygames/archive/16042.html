Here's what I came up with (it's sort of history meets the terminator):<br/><br/>Players are the traditional founding fathers of America (Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, etc)...going through the process and having meetings that eventually lead up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence.<br/><br/>Unfortunately in the immediate future (for the founding fathers), after losing the Revolutionary War to the states, the King of England sets up a secret division (which eventually becomes the Q division of the James Bond movies further in the future) that eventually develops steampunk-ish robots in the late 19th century, which are then sent back in time, to assassinate the founding fathers one by one.<br/><br/>Each founding father would have a unique ability to use during the assassination attempts;  letting Jefferson have a "parkour" ability would lead to some awesome rooftop chases in Philadelphia.<br/><br/>Or this too high-brow?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365654/#Comment_365654" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T06:42:45+00:00" title="March  7, 2012  6:42AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it would be cool if you just did the beginning part and skipped the steampunk terminators part, but I'm a history geek that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365659/#Comment_365659" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T07:04:25+00:00" title="March  7, 2012  7:04AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you checked out Sons of Liberty?

Mainly, Jefferson doing parkour is very SoL.  But if you played up steampunk robots, apocalyptic dread, and Terminator menace, instead of gonzo stunts, you could end up with something that hardly resembles SoL at all! <br/><br/>Also, SoL plays as a very fast paced card-game/roleplaying game. It's a very unique mechanic, so it would be rather easy to not do that.<br/><br/>And if you did the research yourself, you'd have a much better chance to find anecdotes and facts that support your theme much better than the anecdotes and facts that were used for Sons of Liberty.<br/><br/>Maybe America lost the war, and the future hell that England creates includes sending clockwork robots back in time to kill Rebbecca Hawkins, moth of Davy Crockett, leader of the resistance movement. Or for more historical weight, they're gunning for Lincoln's grandparents. Maybe the target is different every time you play! On top of that, players will probably also want to win the war, so you can include that possibility -- especially since it's likely to create instances where they can't both save the person they need to AND win the war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
