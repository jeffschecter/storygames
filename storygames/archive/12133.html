It's something I really like doing, and I've had great luck with it. It helps to think of it as "something we'll do this one time", rather than looking at it like you would a more serious regular gaming group.<br/><br/>I was planning a few things, and I realized that, of the games I personally own and play and love, there are three clear and distinct categories:<br/><br/><b>Games I would totally play with my non-gamer friends:</b> Fiasco*, Shab al-hiri Roach, In A Wicked Age*, Lady Blackbird, old-school D&amp;D (pre-1980)<br/><br/><b>Games I *might* play with my non-gamer friends, depending:</b> Spirit of the Century, Mountain Witch, Dogs in the Vineyard, Dust Devils<br/><br/><b>Games I would never play with my non-gamer friends: </b>Mouse Guard, Burning Wheel, D&amp;D (Red Box, AD&amp;D, 2E, 3E, 4E), Savage Worlds<br/><br/><i>* denotes a game I actually have played with non-gamer friends</i><br/><br/>These are very clear in my mind, although I'm not sure exactly WHAT made me categorize them as such. It's not really setting. Mostly mechanics, ease of pitch, front-loaded entertainment value, etc. <br/><br/>It's like pornography. I can't quite define it, but I know it when I see it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271706/#Comment_271706" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T13:44:55+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  1:44PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as introducing non-gamer friends to the hobby, I've had great success with Lady Blackbird, Geiger Counter, PTA and The Pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271712/#Comment_271712" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T14:08:35+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  2:08PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to hear you break down why you think you wouldn't play those particular games with your non-gamer friends!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271714/#Comment_271714" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T14:11:56+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  2:11PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite>old-school D&amp;D (pre-1980)</blockquote>\nIs there a retro-clone of <i>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> lurking?

Here's the idea, here's what you character is, here's what all these numbers mean, here's what we're gonna do, here's how the funny dice work, etc. <br/><br/>There's a lot of explanation involved.

I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Spirit of the Century has lots of bits that are quick to grasp, and fun (character creation, aspects), but a fair number of sub-systems. Mountain Witch has really simple rules, but asks more of participants than three hours of light engagment.<br/><br/>I guess I'd play something from Category <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> with friends who were more actively interested, like my friend Meredith who doesn't like RPGs much, but loves samurai and film noir and Kurosawa movies. I think he'd dig Mountain Witch, but I haven't convinced him to commit to try it yet. (I did play IAWA with him and his wife, and they had a good time, but I wouldn't have brought tMW unless he'd been more enthusiastic.)<br/><br/>EDIT: It's not "complexity", per se, I don't think.

Here's what I do with a group who has never played RPGs before:<br><br/>* I try to get a game whose fictional content is fictional content that they would like. Anne Rice readers love Vampire, that's why Vampire was popular for so long.  <i>People are willing to learn an enormously complex game, even up front, if it is connected to fiction they understand and love.</i>  So if they're into comics, I look at comic book games. This is why a broad variety of underlying fictions is good and why I was so excited for PTA and Fiasco, they opened up areas of fictions for players that had not been touched on before.<br/><br/>* Once I have that general idea, I try to get a game with <i>clear choices</i>.  This is the main reason D&amp;D (any incarnation) is such a great intro game. There is always, ALWAYS, a clear set of choices as to what to do next. Nobody ever tells a newb D&amp;D player "well, what do YOU think should be there" or "you can do aNNNything you want, man".  D&amp;D newbs are told "look, you can be an elf, half-elf, human or dwarf" "cool, elves are cool, I'll be an elf".  Simple.<br/><br/>* I pick a game and situation that have <i>clear objectives</i>.

If they don't seem to be grooving on the LB pitch, as they usually don't, then I generally end up just using Otherkind dice as a mechanic (the version from VB's blog). I have always been successful with this; the one dice for each goal/danger is intuitive and constantly reinforces player choice over the story. <br/><br/>I also think that player buy-in from doing group setting drafting at the beginning really helps. I usually start off with prodding them to consensus about a genre and then a general premise (in the non-Egri sense). Genre-based storytelling appears to be a lot more comfortable (presumably because everyone knows the prominent themes under consideration) and probably helps to combat the "what should I do now?" paralysis. After generating setting and the premise of the story, we quickly make characters (which amounts to "Pick a noun and three adjectives to describe your character. Then, write three verbs (or verb phrases) to tell what you character can do."). I always start the story itself <i>in media res</i>, which helps to forestall the "what now?" feeling-- the more narrow choices of reaction are a lot more comfortable at first than open-ended sandbox situations. Finally, I do a simple fan mail things that encourages the players to give explicit feedback and reinforcement, which in turn keeps everyone involved and attentive. Throughout all of this, the goal is to keep it simple and keep the enthusiasm rolling (bad pun, sorry).<br/><br/>I read these posts and started thinking about why this approach was most successful for me, and I realized that it's because it reduces the number of rules and moving bits and things that can come between me and the players. Inevitably, the success of running a story game with non-gamers relies upon the GM's ability to react immediately to the non-gamers' needs and expectations. Rules and fiddly bits are critical for my gamer friends, but with non-gamers it is literally all about bringing on the entertainment, which in my experience has always meant keeping the learning curve really low, the mechanics non-intrusive, and-- most importantly-- the players engaged. I think of running a game for non-gamers sort of like fishing-- lure them into the game by giving them exactly what they want (in terms of complete control of setting/genre/premise) and then reel them in without ever letting the line go slack. (Sorry if that analogy sucks; I don't actually fish.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
