This adventure follows <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19254/whitehack-the-rescue" rel="nofollow">The Rescue</a>, so it's easier to understand this report if you've read that one.<br/><br/>The PDF is legally available on the current copyright holder's website. It's in Swedish, but the maps may be of interest. On top of page 12 is "Orchgrottorna" = The Orc Caves, that were part of this session.<br/><br/>We were one player short; the Strong Strong Man was missing. The PCs were the Archer, the Spirit Mage, and the Half-Demon. Stats are <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/429447#Comment_429447" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I told the players over dinner before the session that this adventure is heavily railroaded. I want to play the adventures as written in order to experience the real thing, but I don't want to spend time secretly herding the players along. I told them there's a specific point where I'll put my hand in the air and say "here's the car, please get on".<br/><br/>I did change up the beginning of the adventure a bit, starting in media res, and presented how they got the assignment in flashbacks. So I described how they were on horseback after having left the village Zerim, and a dragon approached in the sky. "Is there anywhere to hide?!" a player asked, but instead of answering I cut to the first flashback scene. The PCs were at Rosita's house two weeks after The Rescue having warm beverages and sandwiches... which the players found hilarious. It's in the text that the GM's supposed to read aloud. It doesn't say "bread", it's sandwiches. An old man knocked on the door and entered from the rain. The Spirit Mage did the secret greeting sign of the Black Cloak Wizards Order. The order is the player's creation, and is a affiliation group assigned to intelligence. I let him roll wisdom to see if he spotted a reaction from the old man, and allowed him to roll double positive since he has Spirit Mage as a vocation group on wisdom. He noticed that the old man reacted, but the man didn't respond in kind.<br/><br/>The old man introduced himself as Lufiathar and said he was looking for a map to a treasure. Part of the map was supposed to be at the hunting castle in The Rescue. They decided to go there the next morning to search for the map. Rosita wanted to join since she was missing a necklace the bandits had stolen. This was my idea, since I wanted both Rosita and Lufiathar in place to set up an ethical dilemma, which I realize now I forgot about. Before leaving the next day the PCs sold 4 of the 10 horses for 60 gp per horse. I later thought that the bandit horses should have had saddles as well, so that was an extra 25 times 4 gold pieces. The PCs only get XP for real treasure, so nothing for selling horses. Realize that the reward for The Rescue was 10% of the loot and 20 gp to divide between the PCs. "We should become horse thieves" and "The bandits were on to something" was remarked.<br/><br/>At the hunting castle the party started searching in the right room immediately: the bandit leader's. The players describe how they removed the furs from the floor, moved furniture, looked in the closet, and so on. Finally I had to help them out a bit. They were inspecting the thickness of the closet to look for a hidden compartment when I told them that the wall next to the closet was suspiciously thick. When they knocked it sounded hollow, so they soon found a hidden door into a small room with a small chest with a small keyhole. They found the key last session on the bandit leader, but I had to remind the players. None of them rolled for wisdom, and I'm still not sure if I should let them describe how they search for as long as they want or if I should suggest a wisdom or intelligence roll. The roll will work like the hint system of a video game, so on a successful roll in another room I'll tell them "It's probably in the bandit leader's room", and if they are in that room I'll say "You should check the walls, the closet and the bed", or whatever. It feels like true OSR GMing would be to lean back and only answer the players' questions when they search a room. It would work if finding things weren't essential to moving the plot along. My problem is that I'm using a plot-based adventure, but want to play it OSR style.<br/><br/>Here's the kicker: the map is not hidden in the small room, but you have to find a secret passage in the wall of the hidden room to another hidden room! I don't know what players would figure that out. So I had Lufiathar say that "it must be in there somewhere", and the Spirit Mage found the hidden passage. They also found treasure in the small chest: jewels for 200 sp, a gold-plated throwing knife worth 190 sp, a small statue worth 75 sp. This is where I wanted the ethical dilemma: Lufiathar would suggest that they take it all, while Rosita would say that they should return 90% to Zerim as part of the old agreement. But I forgot. I realize when I write this that I also forgot to take a share for Lufiathar. I have to play my NPCs with a PC mindset. In the hidden room behind the hidden room they found the map, and together with two parts that Lufiathar already had they figured out they should go to the Dragon Mountain.<br/><br/>I now cut back to the initial scene with the dragon. I think that the players were expecting a fight, but the dragon just passed high above their heads. This is one of the encounters in the text. It prompted a discussion where the players cornered Lufiathar: "You didn't say that the Dragon Mountain would be inhabited!" He tried to calm them down, saying they couldn't be sure the dragon lived there, and so on. It didn't succeed, but they continued. Between Zerim and the Dragon Mountain is a seven day journey with a list of suggested encounters. I used an encounter with invisible fairies drawn to any visible rings or necklaces and had them steal a gold ring from the Spirit Mage. There's nothing in the encounter that the PCs can do about this as written, so it's part of the railroad.<br/><br/>The PCs reached the mountains two days away from the Dragon Mountain. At the end of the first day they were ambushed by orcs. This is where I raised my hand and said "you're supposed to be captured, if you try to fight I'll just add more orcs". This is what the text in the adventure says:<br/><br/>"The PCs are forced to surrender since the orcs have multiple crossbows aiming at them. The PCs have to throw their weapons down, be tied up with ropes, and be transported to the orc's caves. There they're put in the dungeon cell (see 5 on the map)."<br/><br/>It made me feel dirty as GM to do this, but the players accepted. I know that unless I was very clear, no player I've met would ever throw down their PC's weapon and surrender.<br/><br/>The orcs blindfolded them before entering the caves, so the PCs and players wouldn't know how to escape. The orcs took all equipment and weapons, but let the PCs keep their armor. The Half-Demon wears full plate and the Archer leather. The Half-Demon used his super strength, he has Half-Demon as a species group on strength, to bend the bars so they could escape. They went east and found a orc half-asleep on his spear guarding a large boulder that blocked the path. Here the Half-Demon used the first special combat option from Whitehack, as he charged the guard. Charge gives combat advantage, but gives a three point penalty to AC the next round. The Half-Demon has strength 15, with strength 16 he would get +1 damage since he's Strong. Unarmed attacks do 1 hp of damage. Adding it all up gave +4 to hit (+2 base hit bonus and +2 combat advantage) doing 3 hp of damage (1 hp unarmed and 2 hp combat advantage). The orc was a 1 HD monster, so I rolled 1d6 in the open: 5 hp. He was damaged, but not out of the fight. We rolled initiative. The Half-Demon tried another combat option: disarm. The players argued that if you're unarmed and successfully disarms an opponent with a spear or a staff you can steal it from them, instead of tossing the weapon the usual 2d6 feet away. I agreed, but will of course use it with NPCs in the future. We briefly discussed if the Strong specialty with two attacks could be used when disarming, and agreed it could, but the Half-Demon missed both attempts anyway. The strength 6 Spirit Mage saved the day with another charge. He had 0 base hit bonus, otherwise the same as the Half-Demon, and another 3 hp put the orc guard at 0 hp, so he was out of the fight. The PCs killed a guard coming to replace the first one. The new guard had 1 hp so he was marked for death.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430856/#Comment_430856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-11T14:11:03+00:00" title="April 11, 2014  2:11PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the large sleeping chamber I openly rolled 1d6 sleeping orcs, which was one unlucky guy. He was speared in his sleep. Here we had a short discussion on death saves for monsters in Whitehack. One player, arguing based on other OSR games, said they wouldn't have it, and would die at 0 hp. But the text on damage and death says "When someone is hit..." and describes the death save. The next paragraph on damage-reduction saves says "Characters (not creatures) have a special option...", and doesn't say specifically "player characters". The text on monsters' saves says they save on 19-HD, but it doesn't say anything on death saves. So far I've let the opponents die at 0 hp, but I'm not sure. It's of course a formality if the PCs are victorious in a fight, but it can make a difference if they put someone at 0 hp and then have to flee before finishing the opponent off.<br/><br/>Sneaking around some more they found their way out blocked by a room of sleeping worgs. They estimated them to be around a dozen, and decided to sneak back. This time all of PCs had to roll a dexterity roll; I think I forgot Lufiathar. It didn't matter, since the Archer rolled a 20, an abysmal failure. The player described how he dropped his spear and swore loudly, which woke the worgs up. The PCs made a line in the corridor with the Half-Demon and Archer in front, Lufiathar with a spear in the second row, and the Spirit Mage in the second row preparing and using magic. The worgs are 4 HD monsters, so after some back-and-forth, when the front PCs were basically down to 1 hp each, without having killed the first two worgs, the players threw their hands in the air and said "impossible!" We started talking about not having to finish the fight, how the map would be lost when Lufiathar was eaten, so new PCs couldn't really finish the adventure, and so on, when suddenly the Spirit Mage player said "I can use a really huge spell, knocking myself out, but perhaps take the worgs with me". We negotiated that he could take 3d6 of damage and attack all ten (they were only almost a dozen) worgs for 3d6 of damage, which they could save against. The spirit mage is level 1, so the damage would certainly knock him out. But he had to prepare the spell for a whole round, and his initiative was after the two worgs, so they would get two attacks in before the spell. The Archer went down to 0 hp, but wasn't attacked after that, and the Half-Demon was still standing (thanks to a 1 hp attack from the worg).<br/><br/>We rolled damage, saves and hp for all ten worgs, which was actually pretty quick since they all have the same values. The player described how a fire avatar stepped out of his body and charged down the corridor igniting the worgs, while the Spirit Mage fell to the floor unconscious. He killed three worgs, hurt four of them so much they only had a couple of hp left, and three of them saved. Their save was 19-HD, that is, 15. I decided that the surviving worgs would retreat. This was in part because it seemed reasonable due to the flaming mayhem, and in part because the act was so cool I wanted to give the PCs another chance.<br/><br/>We ended the session here. The players were sighing with relief, and I was simply amazed that things turned so quickly from certain doom to a glimmer of hope. The PCs are still trapped in the orc caves, but they have two bottles of healing potions if they can find their equipment. I'm sure that they don't want to leave without their equipment and weapons, so we'll see what will happen next time. We were close to a TPK again, and I kind of hope we won't start next session with one. I'll play the adventure as written, though, so even I don't know if they'll make it or not. It's a very nice feeling.<br/><br/>Some observations:<br/><br/>* Strong PCs get an extra attack when they put an opponent at 0 hp. We forget this all the time. I'm not the only one who should know the rules and remind the players. But I don't want to say that it's only their problem either, since I want them to help me remember monster rules. We didn't need it this session, but the question was raised because of the Strong two-attack specialty. Using the specialty, if the first attack kills an enemy, can they shift the second attack to a new opponent if it's within reach? Does this replace the extra attack from 0 hp, or do they get two attacks at the second foe?<br/><br/>* Since you can't die just from going to 0 hp, there's no risk of dying for wise characters when using suicidal-sized miracles. What's to stop them from casting 20d6 miracles? I need to figure out a limit, probably based on the character's level, so that level 1 mages can't nuke an opposing army.<br/><br/>* I forgot to hand out XP for the orcs and worgs. The three orcs were 3 x 30 XP and the worgs were 10 x 150 XP. I also forgot to give the Archer quest XP from The Rescue, since that player missed last session. The quest XP is modified based on player attendance, not to be used as a big stick, more like encouragement for the players that are always present. This is my idea, and Whitehack doesn't address this. It's not based on how many sessions of the adventure the PC is present, so if your PC is killed, the new PC gets all the quest XP. In this case the player was in three of four sessions, so the Archer will get 0.75 x 1500 = 1125 XP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430872/#Comment_430872" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-12T06:37:53+00:00" title="April 12, 2014  6:37AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure separate threads for each module is a good idea or if I should've combined them into one thread. I'm running with separate threads to see how it goes. It makes it easier for people who know the modules to find the correct posts.<br/><br/>In the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/430789#Comment_430789" rel="nofollow">The Rescue</a> thread Christopher asked:\n<blockquote>Jonas, do you feel like the special combat options would get more use if they were more mechanically advantageous?  I haven't played yet I had the same impression from reading them that your players seem to have had.  They're sort of neat, but seem like usually a bad idea.  There's a system of trade-off balance in place that prevents them from ever being better than just vanilla attacks.</blockquote>\nYes, the text even says:<br/><br/><i>Most of the following suggestions [push, charge, etc] are variations of "take a larger penalty in some area to get a smaller bonus in another" or "forsake damage to get the desired effect and some (combat) advantage - save negates."</i><br/><br/>So the idea is clearly to balance the good with the bad. But it's not "take -1 to hit or damage and get a one point bonus to AC", it's "take -2 to hit or damage and get a one point bonus to AC". In a way it's good that the options doesn't give more benefits than drawbacks, otherwise the players would use them all the time. In this session it was the horrible scripted capture, and the PCs loosing their weapons, that prompted the use of special combat options. One PC even fought defensively, the -2 for one point AC above, to stay alive while the Spirit Mage prepared the fire spell. I can easily see very specific situations where you want to use the options, like pushing someone over a cliff edge or grappling with someone you don't want to harm.\n<blockquote>I'd award monster XP for anything that feels like the obstacle was overcome -- killing, running them off, befriending them, whatever.  Avoiding them and leaving them as a threat doesn't count (though that has it's own reward too).  It's interesting that you'd "take" a share of XP for your NPC but have no hand in the distribution otherwise.  I'm inclined to stay entirely out of how the PCs distribute treasure and take full-charge of XP -- even distribution with maybe half-shares for hirelings or whatever.</blockquote>\nI started out putting down in text how I wanted to distribute both treasure XP and monster XP, but quickly realized it would still end up with me having to make a decision at game time, since you can't account for all situations in advance. Since I would have to consult the players to get their buy-in when writing the rules, why not hand the game time responsibility to the players? I don't see how it can be used in a way I would call abuse. I mean, since we have a rule that new PCs start at the lowest current level of the party, the players could hand all XP to one PC, level it up quickly, and commit suicide. Then do the same at next level. But I don't see that happening.<br/><br/>I always wanted the players to distribute treasure, like gold and magical swords, and my first idea was that the PC who received the gold also got the XP for it. But if they find a 5000 gp crown it's kind of strange that the person carrying it would get all of the 5000 XP, and it could lead to unnecessary arguments when dividing the loot, so I decided to disconnect the gold from the XP.<br/><br/>I haven't needed to take a share for NPCs yet. I forgot about the treasure XP for Lufiathar at the hunting castle, and we all forgot the XP from the orcs and worgs. The treasure XP is already divided, but I'll make sure Lufiathar gets some of the monster XP at the start of next session.\n<blockquote>I've also been thinking about HP costs of miracles and wondering about consistency. I decided that when we get there, my inconsistency can at least somewhat be waved away by asserting that ambient magic ebbs and flows through the world. And if I do set some precedent that feels like I've given the PCs too much power -- the powerful demon for one HP as you suggest, then I can also give that power to NPCs who oppose the players. Verisimilitude and balance all in one.</blockquote>\nThe most important thing is that the GM and the player agree that the HP costs are fair and fun. I'm very democratic as a GM, and ask what the group thinks would be appropriate, while still stating my opinion. It's easy to invent an in-fiction explanation for why a spell is suddenly cheaper or more expensive, but I wouldn't want to use that without player buy-in. If the player really wants the 1 HP demons, we'll have to agree that this is how powerful magic is for everyone, even enemies. Also, the rest of the players have to agree that it won't put them out of business if the mage can summon demons that do the fighting for the whole group. We're all looking for the appropriate level of challenge, both the GM and players.<br/><br/>Caster level is part of the equation, so you can always change HP costs when the mage levels up, at least it's easy to make them cheaper. In my case, we're currently talking about a level 1 mage. I understand that level 1 mages in OD&amp;D weren't super powerful! It's easier to make miracles somewhat limited or expensive at level 1, and then make them cheaper as the PC levels up, than the other way around. What you want to avoid is 1-for-1, that the mage pays 1 hp to do 1 hp of damage. Our baseline for the Spirit Mage's fire spells are at the moment 1 hp for 1d6 of damage, the target can save. The save can be replaced by a to-hit roll instead, if the spell is used as a regular weapon, say sword made of fire where the fire is the only dmage. If you ignite an actual sword, I'd say that the target can save, since it will be damaged by the sword itself. Increasing one parameter, say affect more than one target, do more damage, or remove the save, will up the hp cost to 1d6. I'm thinking now that the number of targets at base cost can follow the caster level, so at level 2 he can attack two targets with 1d6 damage, save negates, for 1 hp cost. If he survives until level 2.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430968/#Comment_430968" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-14T13:32:46+00:00" title="April 14, 2014  1:32PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do like to see players using special combat options to make combats more interesting, though as you I agree that they shouldn't be used all the time.

A useful house-rule we apply is that on a critical hit, the attacker gets to choose a single special combat option to apply it's effect to the opponent.</blockquote>\nA nice idea to connect it to critical hits. So they get damage multiplication, and a special combat option without the option's drawback? I'm concerned that the damage multiplication is enough advantage, but I agree it's fun to make fights more dynamic. I've actually held back my narration a bit, because I don't want to introduce for example the push effect by description only. But at the same time I want characters to move around. It would be nice if each round is fought in a new part of the area, first at the foot of the stairs, then in the stairs, then on the top of the stairs, instead of just standing still and exchanging blows. There's off course a difference between voluntary movement and getting pushed, so I think I should just start being more free in my narration.<br/><br/>I realize now that I could have used push tactically in the fight with the worgs. The corridor was only wide enough for two people, so two PCs stood in the front line and faced two worgs. They just traded blows back and forth, with the other eight worgs waiting behind. If one of the worgs had pushed a PC backwards, it would suddenly be next to the other PC, and a new worg could step up to take its old place. That way, three worgs could attack a single PC, with combat advantage since he's now being flanked. That would've been really neat. As GM I must lead by example if I want the options used, and not just say "the worg bites".<br/><br/>I'd like to flip the critical hit idea around: On a critical failure the opponent gets to pick a free special combat option. That way you can stumble backwards (push), drop your weapon (disarm), or lose your balance (trip), which gives the opponent an advantage. The two ideas are complementary, off course.<br/><br/>Another idea for critical failures in fights is that the opponent immediately gets a free attack. I want to use the same rules for PCs and NPCs, though, so if the opponent gets to choose between a free attack or a special combat option, the players will probably pick the free attack every time. So I think limiting critical failures to special combat options is a good idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431109/#Comment_431109" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-16T10:41:15+00:00" title="April 16, 2014 10:41AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2014 12:24PM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually stole this from Dragon Age Stunts, and it certainly has made our group combats a lot more interesting. I let players choose between double damage or any applicable tactical options (which they can of course also try while on battle). Since we use a system that looks a bit more like the 3d6 used on Dragon Age, criticals are more usual and combat more dynamic. We even use defensive stunts when a player loses the combat roll but still rolls doubles; in that case they can't avoid the damage, but are either able to regain their step if they stumble, read through their opponent's attacks and get +1 to AC, find a weak spot and get +1 to their next attack, etc.<br/><br/>Of course, giving the opponents the same tactical advantages on crits and fumbles is only fair and also makes combats a lot more interesting. :9<br/><br/><br/>Edit: Here\xb4s the list of <b>Combat critical effects</b> I'll be using on my next design. Fits a small corner of the character sheet:<br/><br/><b>On a simple cr\xedtical while attacking you can</b>: try to intimidate your opponent, gain ground (you make your opponent move in a direction of your choice, the difference between rolls in meters or until they reach an obstacle), buy time, distract or break their guard (giving them disadvantage to block)<br/><br/><b>On a confirmed critical you can:</b> Double damage, trip, disarm, damage a weapon, damage an armor, slow them down, stun or corner (opponent can\xb4t dodge or move without provoking an attack)<br/><br/><b>When you miss a combat roll you go on the defensive. If you missed by 5 or less you get wounded but even on your last breath you still can:</b> Try to counter, Roll with the impact (get away from your opponent), Measure your opponent (block, parry or dodge next attack with Advantage) or Deny a critical effect from your opponent.<br/><br/><b>On a critical in Initiative</b> you get +1 to your next action.<br/><br/>These actually consider a system I've tried before, where there's no AC in combat but opposed rolls. There's no such thing as an active turn where you get to attack and then you sit like a duck doing nothing until it's your turn again. Instead both opponents state their actions and winner forces the opponent on the defensive. Anyway, most of this still can do into any system with a critical chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
