Rules would be things like not allowing a starting Warhammer character to have more than 20 wounds. Narration would cover things like not allowing your character to be made entirely out of cheese in the middle of a Rolemaster game.<br/><br/>(Since both types of restrictions are validated the same way, you could arguably just treat them as equals. Most people I've met though do differentiate between rules and narrations, so I'll adopt this distinction here as well.)<br/><br/>It seems to me that conflicts at the game table do not necessarily arise from favouring one over the other, but are instead inevitable if there is disagreement in how binding the two are at all. Whichever element you treat less seriously, will lose its influence and impact on the game played. If you rewrite or ignore rules constantly you'll find that the game's rules provide little to support to get to that 'fruitful void'. I'm not that interested in looking at the effects that playing close to the rules has on a game, though.<br/><br/>Instead Im more interested in how narration actually impacts gameplay. What are the rules that govern actual narration in play? To avoid confusion I'll refer to those rules of narration as "axioms". I think they consist of three distinct elements, which each group emphasises differently. <br/><br/>1) The type of situation the players are confronted with, the etiquette of character interaction and the usual flow of events in the gameworld can often be inferred from the rulebook and occasionally additional sourcebooks. The setting material, the optional rules and descriptions usually help to suggest a 'typical' game session. These things help the group to ease into the Axiom of the Game. <br/><br/>2) Sources unrelated to the roleplaying game, such as books, movies, TV, etc can also be used to infer axioms. The most familiar examples are probably Call of Cthulhu, Lord of the Rings, Star Trek or any licensed game for that matter. I'd argue that the recent threads about improv techniques, narrative structures, etc. fall into this category as well. Here people draw upon texts that have nothing to do with roleplaying games to formulate an Axiom of Genre. <br/> <br/>3) This is something that goes without saying for most gaming groups, but I think it should be noted still. Here the consistency of the events in the gameworld (or simply: fiction) is of high importance. The group attempts to keep contradictions out of all narration, forming an Axiom of Fiction.<br/><br/>These make up the axioms of the gaming group. It should be noted that they are most commonly negotiated indirectly, that is to say without adressing them openly. Instead they emerge during the game and follow from the actions or narrations of each player. Out of the assumptions, prior knowledge and habits of each player the axioms are assembled bit by bit. <br/><br/>At first glance, the fact that these axioms are not written down or otherwise made explicit seems to invite misunderstandings or conflicts. This stumbling block is actually a hidden strength of roleplaying games. At the game table each player recognises those axioms (even if he rarely verbalises them to himself or others) and - provided he has the necessary social skills - attempts to combine his actions and narrations with them. Think of it as the "so that's how they do it round here"-technique. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Based on this, the individual visions of these axioms can lead to very unique and original over-all narration. The fiction of the game becomes unique to the gaming group and explicitly not a carbon copy of book or film narration. I, at least, find this very appealing.<br/><br/>This creation of axioms rarely, if ever, takes center stage at a gaming session. Which is why it is often so difficult to isolate it from simple everyday interaction between friends. But then again, you rarely need to pay attention to them anyway, unless you want to "try something different". That's when the established axioms need to be torn down and re-negotiated. Otherwise the "new game" will feel distinctly like the "old game". Worst case, the "new game" comes across as an unplayable mess, because your narration doesn't feed into the overall game sequence the way you're used to. I've had this happen very often with Primetime Adventures. A game that can quickly fall apart, if you narrate the same way as you would in you regular D&amp;D-game. <br/><br/>Unlike rules (where the GM usually decides how close to stick to them and when and how they are applicable), axioms are the province of the players. The stereotype of the group of players, who do not care about the appropriate etiquette at the King's Court or whose character gain or lose personality traits from session to session, is probably the most well-known example of a group of players who pay no attention to their axioms. On the other side of the scale you might find the Nitpicking Nerd (which most Lord of the Rings and Trek groups are afraid of) who criticises every deviance or contradiction to the original text. It should be noted, that either behaviour is only a problem, if the rest of the group disagrees.<br/><br/>Some games like to hardwire specific axioms into the rules. This takes the burden off the player somewhat and is a useful idea, if they are unsure about the axioms. Maybe because they don't know the setting material well enough, aren't accustomed to the genre or simply have little experience with roleplaying games. They give players recognisable guidelines to provide good or appropriate narration. Some players though feel heavily constrainted in such games, as they draw much of their enjoyment out of playing with and by their own axioms. <br/><br/>Asking for the right "game" for a specific book/film/etc. is often a way of asking how to get the according axioms in place in your own gaming group. The question is, whether it's a better idea to simply openly talk about all possibly axioms instead of reducing yourself to the Axiom of the Game.<br/><br/>Comments? Objections?

Everything's narration. I'm also not sure the divide between players and GM rely jives with an Everwayian perspective. The GM is explicitly instructed to take internal cause and genre conventions into account when making decisions. The players, iirc, aren't, but nothing stops them from doing so if they wanted to. But the explicit strong recommendations to the GM to think about internal cause and genre into account strikes me as narration being more important to the GM than players. <br/><br/>In any case, I'd recommend thinking about your case is an environment with no or minimalistic rules (e.g. all disputes are resolved by one person's "the GMs" decision).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101679/#Comment_101679" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T12:52:02+00:00" title="October  8, 2007 12:52PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the other hand, Everway does have game-mechanical rules that are more than mere axioms. The GM is told to resolve conflicts or attempts to do things by comparing the relevant stats (i.e., "karma") as well as by narrative necessity ("drama") or by reading a card ("fortune"). I think the distinction between "rules" (to refer to the game-mechanical) and "axioms" (to refer to the usually tacit assumptions about the nature of the game, the genre, and the fiction we're collaboratively creating) is useful, particularly as a way of parsing out aspects of the "social contract" that define "how we play around here."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101682/#Comment_101682" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T12:55:52+00:00" title="October  8, 2007 12:55PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>2) Sources unrelated to the roleplaying game, such as books, movies, TV, etc can also be used to infer axioms.

It is more specific than genre, since a given set of texts will have more constraints that general genre (eg Ann Rice vampires vs. the general concept of what vampires do, how to to kill them etc.)  This is a strongly used, little noted phenomenon. It underpins games like Primetime Adventures, for example, which uses the shared context of television to allow people to create well focused games.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101683/#Comment_101683" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T12:57:20+00:00" title="October  8, 2007 12:57PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily, I agree.

I've understood 'genre' as also covering things inferred from 'canon', common assumptions or even misconceptions about the original texts. Canon is verfiable, genre is mostly defined by how familiar certain elements are to the group. The latter is far more important I think, than the validity of the 'canon' facts. <br/><br/>Additionally I find it difficult to talk about canonical readings of texts that require some interpretation to understand. In an academic context, this isn't a problem of course; but a roleplaying game hardly qualifies as such. That's why I'm still leaning closer to 'genre'. Although I think 'canon' covers most of the same ground.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
