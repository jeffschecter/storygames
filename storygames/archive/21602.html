Have talked at length on other sites why I change SP in LotFP books to GP in my campaign world. 5e coins weigh much less than LotFP coins do. (And when I was running aQ it made sense, historically dinars were tiny little gold pieces and the dinar prices matched up well with GP prices in 5e.) <em>Oooor</em> you <em>could</em> do the other way around if you are using some parts of 5e but primarily in a LotFP setting.</dd><dt>Lume</dt><dd>Accordingly, 1 lume now costs 1 gp. I like the lume idea a lot. One lume worth of materials, lantern oil, candles etc weigh 8 coins or one sixth lb. Torches suck, they weigh one full lb for a single lume. But are cheaper at the surface where they only cost 1 cp i.e. a hundred of a lume! Down below they still cost 1 gp though. But no-one uses torches there.</dd><dt>Dark vision</dt><dd>As per Veins. Straight up. Sorry warlocks.</dd><dt>Light-giving magic</dt><dd>Slot-cost is unchanged (i.e.\xa0cantrips still cantrips) but their material components (for example fireflies or moss for \u201cLight\u201d) now cost one GP per hour (and you can\u2019t component bag or arcane focus components that cost money). Six hours worth weighs 1 lb in 5e\u2019s encumbrance system. I.o.w. one hour\u2019s worth of these components weigh 8 coins.</dd><dt>AC</dt><dd>Pa/Lea<strong>|</strong>Stu/Hi<strong>|</strong>ChSh<strong>|</strong>Sca/Brea/Ri<strong>|</strong>Ha<strong>|</strong>Cha<strong>|</strong>Spl<strong>|</strong>Pla</dd></dl><p>(In other words: \u201cas leather\u201d = 11, \u201cas plate\u201d = 18, as Scale = 14 etc)</p><dl><dt>To hit, save etc</dt><dd>use the standard WotC rule (half hd + 2)</dd><dt>XP</dt><dd>use the method in the DMG.

So it\u2019s no weirder using Veins\u2019 custom falling damage system with 5e than it is to use it with LotFP for those who wish and the table is right there in Veins\u2019 back pages, easy to find. <a href="http://test.lotfp.com/RPG/discussion/post/5797/#p5797" rel="nofollow">I ran the math on it here</a> and it does what it says on the tin, it equalizes the levels.

Hello death spiral.</dd></dl><p>I\u2019ll explain the same thing two ways. To make 5e\u2019s system more like Veins:</p><p>I\u2019ll add in from Veins that you gain exhaustion levels on passing up opportunities to, hmm, \u201ceat\u201d in the way Veins proposes. In 5e the count resets to zero when you have a normal day of eating, I\u2019ll up that to Vein\u2019s steeper requirements for resetting.</p><p>To make Vein\u2019s system more like 5e: Instead of three steps 1-3, 4-6, 7+, it\u2019s two steps, skipping the \u201cstarving\u201d step. You go from hungry to dying after 3+Con days. So could be faster than three days but usually four or more days. Also according to 5e you can eat half food to only advance the clock half a day.</p><p><b>Edit:</b> This turned out to be pretty stupid in actual play. If you can reset the clock by eating 1 normal-day-of-eating, as per 5e, then why would you want to try to eat every day? You\u2019d only need to eat every 5th day (if you have +2 con). Instead, the \u201ceat triple\u201d rule needs to come into place right away. That is my house rule.</p><p>So this is the rule now:</p><ul><li>Eating normally keeps the clock where it is.</li><li>Eating triple, or eating 1 humanoid (and one humanoid satisfies the entire party (up to like 24 people if you have a big party)), resets the clock.</li><li>Skipping food advances the clock one step.</li><li>Eating half food advances the clock a half step.</li><li>For every step the clock advances past 3+con step, you get 1 exhaustion level (no save).</li><li>If the clock has advanced past 3+con steps, if you give up the chance to eat a humanoid (like your best friend breaks their leg or something), you get 1 exhaustion level.</li></ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StoneTharp" title="StoneTharp"><img alt="StoneTharp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StoneTharp">StoneTharp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472592/#Comment_472592" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T00:13:18+00:00" title="April 21, 2018 12:13AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks like an excellent set of adaptations for mashing Veins up into 5e!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472604/#Comment_472604" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T04:13:48+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  4:13AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you StoneTharp. I'm especially happy with the idea of upping the cost of material components for light-giving magic to match other lume sources. 5e already has the rule that you can use either arcane focus or your component bag for material components with no cost listed; that you're assumed to always have some scraps of leather, fireflies etc in your bag and/or that your focus can replace that. At first I was thinking to make it cost slots, one slot is a harsh price to pay for one hour of light -- but I like the components thing better. You can get back slots by resting, but not components.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention the light as initiative thing. I am gonna use that from Veins, generally the light&amp;dark stuff in Veins have so many good solutions to things I've been struggling with since 5e came out.<br/><br/>PS to other groups: feel free to pick&amp;choose from my ideas. If you prefer Veins' encumbrance system, use it. If you prefer SP over GP use that. (Generally one SP in LotFP = one GP in most other books but it's up to you which you change. I prefer the smaller coins. But I'm more likely to have a barkeep say 10 sp than one GP, i.e. I best-of-both-worlds a bit by getting the price lists of GP-using books (generally 2e, ACKS, and 5e all match up well enough) with the "gold is special":ness of LotFP.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474490/#Comment_474490" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-06T09:35:52+00:00" title="June  6, 2018  9:35AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've made some changes:<br/><br/><b>Component price</b><br/>I lowered the surface price of the Light cantrip's components to 1 silver for a six-pack (i.e. six uses) and components enough for six uses take up a Small item slot [i.e. about 1LB]. Each use still is 1GP if you try to buy it down below.<br/><br/><b>Specialist climbing</b><br/>The idea of "specialists get two tries at climbing"... since everyone can already climb in 5e, that became weird. And basing it off "being proficient in Athletics" doesn't really make sense, it already increases your chance of success.<br/><br/>Instead, if you have <b>Second-Story Work</b> thief feature, your (time-derived) DC is halved. So if someone with Second-Story Work studies the route for &lt; 1 round, their DC is 10 with disad instead of 20 with disad. If they study the route for &lt; 10 minutes, their DC is 7 instead of 15. But only one try tho.<br/><br/>And having Second-Story Work also unlocks attempting to climb at human limit and superhuman (Veins difficulty levels 5 and 6).<br/><br/>(Also level 9 monks can run up vertical (Veins difficulty levels 2 and 3) walls with their <b>Unarmored Movement</b> feature.)<br/><br/>So to summarize the climbing:<br/><br/>With a rope and outside of combat, anyone can do Veins difficulty levels 1,2, and 3. Having a Climbing speed or Second-Story Work makes you faster.<br/><br/>Without a rope, Veins difficulty level 2 is also fine for most, outside of combat. Just takes time.<br/><br/>There's more, just read Veins p210.<br/><br/>For difficulty level 3 (w/o rope) or 4 (regardless of rope), anyone can try it, one try. <br/>Second-Story Work just halves your DC, it doesn't give you two tries.<br/><br/>For difficulty level 5 or 6, you need Second-Story work. (Or spells!)<br/>And your DC isn't halved for them.<br/><br/>Uh, that wasn't an easy summary. But...<br/>what I like about the Veins system is that the DC is time based rather that how hard the route is, and then the <i>consequences</i> are based on how hard the route is.<br/>And I like that you have to study in the light and do new rolls based on light. (It's always been a fuzzy and unclear question how often you need to roll when climbing.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
