More streamlined versions of keys (like in Lady Blackbird) appeal to me even more.<br/><br/>I'm using a modified version of Keys in Heart of Ashes, and they are even more streamlined than those in Lady Blackbird, in an attempt at making them even more elegant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268135/#Comment_268135" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T13:42:16+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  1:42PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Soul Gazing.

I like games that are played close to the characters and leave the setting as window dressing and plot as something best understood in hindsight.  I like hard divisions of authority so that when my stuff, clashes with your stuff we BOTH end up some where uncomfortable.

My game preference (I'll try any game once but am fiercely loyal to the games I click with) can be extrapolated out to just about anything in life.  Inside a specific type of experience (roleplaying) I'll try just about any variation if someone I know, trust or respect has a high opinion of it.  I refuse to pre-judge a game before I've tried it (and often, won't even judge it based on the writing).  I'll buy games and play them once and never look at them again and still feel satisfied because I had a new experience with a game.  *shrug*  I am satisfied by making immediate and short-lived connections with games and that applies to the rest of my life, too.  That said, there's a group of games that I will probably love forever, even if everyone around me decides they hate them.  Even if I never play them again, I'll read the source books and imagine games I won't ever play.  <br/><br/>It occurs to me that this is really the only kind of feedback I can give.  If this is how I feel about games, and it applies similarly to the rest of life, what DOES that say about me?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268334/#Comment_268334" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T11:58:18+00:00" title="April 22, 2010 11:58AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno (joepub)</cite><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>*What makes a game speak to you, on a personal level?<br/>Setting.</blockquote>\n...And how does a game's setting speak to you, on a personal level?<br/>What feelings or emotions does it stir up?<br/>Why?<br/>How does that connect with the your understanding of yourself?<br/><br/>A game's setting speaks to me most when it represents the kind of thematic conflicts that I find appealing.  Themes of moral or religious conflict (like Dogs in the Vineyard) especially.  I've had a fascination with the subject since as long as I've been playing RPGs.  I am almost always the cleric in the party and almost all of my characters have or take on a religious cast.  Why this speaks to me exactly, I'd be hard pressed to say.

The most mainstream games I've played the past 5 years have been Trail of Cthulhu and Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay v3. Within the world of small press games, the whole family of Burning Wheel games (in order of preference: BE, Blossoms, BW, MG, Jihad) gets the most love. <br/><br/>* I regularly participate in two game-related forums and irregularly participate in three others.<br/><br/>* I have a standing Tuesday evening game night, which 80% of the time is one ongoing game or another. "Ongoing" in this case means something with more than a couple sessions. Games rarely last more than 10 or so sessions.<br/><br/>* I have a fairly regular ever-other-Thursday group as well. The title turnover is way WAY higher here, and it's exclusively small press games. <br/><br/>* Every regular roleplayer in my world is white and male. I am not the oldest but I'm in the top 20% bracket for age.<br/><br/>* I spend maybe an hour at most doing game prep if I'm running something. On that note, I'm the one running something 75% of the time (both groups).<br/><br/>* Both Tuesday and Thursday guys do a LOT of playtesting. Those playtests come either from me or Eric Boyd (Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries).<br/><br/>* I rarely post about gaming subjects on my Facebook account. When I do it's almost immediately followed by "wtf?" comments from my non-gaming friends, and my response is to be self-deprecating about being an inveterate gaming nerd.<br/><br/>* I feel most comfortable playing and running RPGs that require a strong GMing role as well as provide a clear delineation of responsibilities between players and GM. In turn I feel least comfortable, and derive the least amount of pleasure, from games that actively mess with that arrangement. So, like, I've had a lot of fun with Lacuna, InSpectres, Dust Devils and DitV but I've had trouble nailing down and extracting the fun from Shock:, Universalis, and PTA.<br/><br/>* When I'm playing I'm usually either a total spotlight whore or find myself in a peer-coaching type of position. If I'm playing something I'm super-familiar with or have previous GMed, I'll often jump in with my own resolution rather than waiting for the GM to tell me what to roll.<br/><br/>* I actively dislike most fantasy fiction but really love playing and GMing in fantasy settings. The opposite is (mostly) true of sci-fi: Love reading it, have a hell of a time running in it.<br/><br/>* My fantasy settings are usually apocalyptic: fallen empires, lost secrets, strongmen leaders, creatures and other horrors unambiguously tied to whatever went wrong.<br/><br/>* My scifi settings usually feature evil corporations and grand conspiracies.<br/><br/>* If I buy a game it's only with the intent to run it and never, ever to just read it. I am rarely an early adopter of new hotnesses, and prefer a game be out a year or so before I commit to buying it. I'll typically read its rpg.net reviews, follow conversations on some forums and read its FAQ before buying. The last new hotness I jumped in on without enough research was WFRP3 and I regret that decision. The next new hotness I will be jumping in on without enough research is Freemarket.<br/><br/>At no point in this exercise did anything jump out as me saying anything special about myself. I guess I hold games to high standards, don't want to waste my time or money, know my players very well, am generally protective of my hobby, and am kind of a showoff within my "circle of trust".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
