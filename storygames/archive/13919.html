I couldn't make heads nor tales* of it. When Diaspora came along I found I had a better grasp of it, but not enough to play it. Aspects were still rather fuzzy for me, and my brother isn't doing much better. Now I've got a copy of Legends of Anglerre, and I'm finding for the first time FATE is really starting to make sense, and when thinking about aspects I'm no longer thinking "Hmm, ok...." but instead "So with two shifts on my sneak roll, I can tag myself with the aspect hidden, for which I get one free use of it without spending a fate point for a re-roll/+2 on my backstab attempt." Even if that's not how it's supposed to work, the fact that I think that's how it works means it's a game I can actually start playing now.<br/><br/>It seems each new iteration of FATE 3.0 is doing a better job of explaining the rules. (Incidentally, it's probably not that unusual, as most games don't get to have Robin Laws writing them, and unlike FATE, they don't have multiple appearances either).<br/><br/>*typo that I decided to leave                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
