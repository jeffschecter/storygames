I enjoyed the game, and I could really rave on about how much I like the character creation and plot creation systems.  Instead, I want to present a couple issues I have with the game.  <br/><br/><b>Whiff Factor</b><br/>When an attacker fails to exceed the defense rating the conflict and the verb in question is already primed, then nothing of consequence happens.  The conflict is not moved in any direction.  This doesn't feel satisfying.<br/><br/><b>PC Death</b><br/>When the GM chooses to spend three push dice to kill a PC, who gets the spent push dice?  The PC's player won't have any use for them if his character is dead.  I think I'd like this rule better if it were "Spend 3 Push dice to mortally wound."<br/><br/><b>Task Resolution</b><br/>At one point during our session, I described my character's attempt to jump a motorcycle (using a pile of trash and a dumpster as a ramp) onto a fire escape to rescue one of his contacts from a blazing building.  There were no characters opposing my jump - just the laws of physics.  We attempted to personify those harsh laws as my opposition in the conflict, but it didn't feel satisfying.  Should we have just rolled against a flat target number?  Is there another way to handle this conflict that missed?  I suspect that we would have enjoyed using a single target number and resolving the jump with a pass/fail outcome, but I suspect we would have been flatly breaking the rules to do so.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327942/#Comment_327942" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T07:56:00+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  7:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite><br/><b>Task Resolution</b><br/>At one point during our session, I described my character's attempt to jump a motorcycle (using a pile of trash and a dumpster as a ramp) onto a fire escape to rescue one of his contacts from a blazing building.

If you look at the "Set Up" rule for contention, (page 86 of the new PDF) you'll see that it's difficulty 4 to put an adjective on the environment. Just inflict "jumped" on the obstacle and you're done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327953/#Comment_327953" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T08:29:12+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  8:29AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't peruse RPG.net very often.

Feedback! <br/><br/>Oh, I totally need to add a section on PC Death. The player keeps those Push dice and any others she already had and starts with those when she makes her new character. So say you had 2 and I killed you. You would make a new character with 5 dice, all ready for some screaming vengeance.<br/><br/>As to the whiff factor, was there a lot of failed rolls in your session? Could you guesstimate a failed to successful roll ratio?<br/><br/>And task resolution. Lukas said pretty much what my intent is. <br/><br/>In an early playtest there was an androgynous character dressed only in a bath-towel jumping from a rooftop into a helicopter. It was a Move roll, but not to see if ze would make it into the helicopter\u2014it was to see if the sniper on the rooftop across the alley would be <i>distracted</i> (there was probably a better adjective used, but I can't remember off hand) by what he saw when hir towel flared up during the jump.<br/><br/>So if there's a way to frame a stunt like that as an attack (or a set-up as Dylan suggested), that's the best. I hesitate to add a straight task resolution option into the rules because I think that runs counter to some of the themes of the game. But I'll think on this some more.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for playing the beta and talking about how your session went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327966/#Comment_327966" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T09:16:59+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  9:16AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, I was planning on emailing Jeremy with the feedback from that session privately, but I too had a few of the questions like "Maybe others hit this too and could be helped by the replies", so I'll post here today as well.<br/><br/>The short of it was that we loved it.<br/><br/>Eric, who hacks FUCKING EVERYTHING, basically said, "This game really speaks to me.

It gave me flashbacks to D&amp;D sessions where a dozen whiffs in a row meant huge blocks of nothing is happening time.  I can live with a game providing occational whiffs, but every time I'll wish that <i>something </i>had changed in the fiction.\n<blockquote>You would make a new character with 5 dice, all ready for some screaming vengeance.</blockquote>\nOkay.

I don't really mind if narratively he spits blood and moans while grabbing his stomach for the rest of the fight and then dies a few minutes afterwards, but he has to die (because severe actions have severe consequences) and he has to be out of the fight (because that's the benefit of spending 3 instead of 2).<br/><br/>Of course, I don't have to make the GM play by the same rules. There's different motivations going on (killing should be a narrative decision more than a tactical one).<br/><br/>Anyway, that's me thinking out loud while I consider this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328015/#Comment_328015" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T12:07:10+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 12:07PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 12:13PM by Judd.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The rules on death were the first things to catch my eye.

My thoughts on the game are as follows:<br/><br/>I was given a description of the transmission and I thought up the protagonist I'd want to read about if it were a novel. The system did not limit me or force me to rewrite my initial concept at all. By pseudo roleplaying during chargen (choosing alliances and making calls on them), I not only got a feel for what my character was but was also given a new spin by the subsequent choices (going into debt to Loren and having to buy three weapons from Syd instead of just the one). This is awesome to me! The more of this kind of thing the better.<br/><br/>The adjectives for my relationship with these contacts/alliances, however, were weak. I struggled to choose them for each alliance - they were too passive and didn't make an evocative feel for the relationship.<br/><br/>On the character sheet, I'd like to see a section for cost directly under the name of the equipment. Base + Upgrades - Discounts would be nice. Also, you might want to add story tags that make them cheaper, too - stolen is already in there, but traceable, loud, beta (glitchy), etc.<br/><br/>I struggled to be able to see how we were going to personify non-NPC forces. A ton of advice would be necessary if I were ever going to run this instead of just play it.<br/><br/>I would like to put an NPC or PC down on my contacts list, but I don't think that was mentioned. An initial adjective during our first encounter would be cool, too.<br/><br/>Implant as a tag - some items make sense, but some weapons do not. But if I want a neural link to my gun, I have to take implant. What is being implanted? Maybe a series of interface devices for equipment would be helpful.<br/><br/>There was no cost for lifestyle. Is this a conscious choice? I thought it was one of the best parts of Shadowrun - you were going to continue to lose money if you didn't do anything or while you were healing. Great pressure, there.<br/><br/>Making it clear that if you want to give a sticky adjective, you have to narrate your own adjective or tag and use the die in the roll would be helpful.<br/><br/>Back to work, if I think of other things, I'll pop in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328190/#Comment_328190" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T08:58:17+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  8:58AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the notes, Mark.

Why?<br/>Character generation: Simple, focused. It really made for playable characters quickly.<br/>Buying stuff: Just the fact that if you really want anything you have to start in debt or owing favors, that part is really cool and really brings up story elements quickly.<br/>Rolling for plot elements: The story unfolded quickly.<br/>The closed Push Dice economy: They go from the PCs to the GM and back to the PCs.<br/>NPCs have solid, limited things that they can do, and it's all mechanical<br/><br/>Which parts of the session were the least fun? Why?<br/>Getting into a situation where we couldn't figure out how to address through the contention rules (see below).<br/><br/>Did you play out a full contention?<br/>Yep, several. None of them involving combat/violence though. Two involving Stickying adjectives, but none involving Permanence or Death.<br/><br/>Did you use a Transmission?<br/>Yep: LA Sprawl<br/><br/>Did you make a plot map? Did it provide you with content to use in game?<br/>Yep on both.<br/><br/>Were any rules or procedures confusing? Which ones? What was confusing?<br/>(more below as well)<br/><br/>* There are lot of areas with "wait for illo", I would have loved to see even simple crappy hand-drawn crap: I'm a visual person and that would have helped a little. But then again, Beta and all.<br/><br/>* I'm not sure about the rules for actually adding more stuff to the Map. Do you only do it when you hit up NPCs and roll on their charts?<br/><br/>* See more in Contention feedback below<br/><br/>Did you use house rules? <br/>Nope.<br/><br/>What else should I know?<br/><br/>* On the character sheet, you should fill in the first dot on each box. You basically are told to do that in the rules, but having it done for you (since there are no "zeros" under the Actions/Verbs) just makes sense.<br/><br/>* You should have an NPCs sheet: Multiple areas to create quick NPCs and have them in front of you.<br/><br/>* I really like the Training Programs. But these really hearken to a lot of the J-RPGs I like ("choose three classes, you can take one more than once").<br/><br/>* While others thought the relationship adjectives were limited ("they don't push me"), I liked them: Some are weak, some are very strong. So you don't have to have a really brilliant/heated relationship with everyone you know, but you can choose to do so.<br/>One thing: They don't spell out: For "lustful/obsessive/etc" (all of them), is it Protagonist to NPC? NPC to Protagonist? Both? Player's choice? We decided it was two-way, but something like obsessive or protective or dependent might be hard to portray both-way (Well, dependent is kinda easy: Listen to NIN as you play).<br/><br/>* In my transmission, I'm creating 12 NPCs. There are 6 by default, but I'm thinking that you can do a "Here are 12, pick 6", where each pair shares the same Connection chart.<br/><br/>* I don't believe that the Transmission Connections/NPC's column of "Connected vs Unconnected" was explained in the rules, but I might have missed that.<br/><br/>* Might want to make it clearer that "unless you actually IMPLANT the gear, you basically carry it around in your pants." It actually wasn't super-clear until I confirmed the rules and dropped that "pants line" above. Might want to also recount that in the cyberware gear area: "Reminder: It costs 5 Kred (or a favor to a Splicer connection) to actually implant it, otherwise you simply carry it around."<br/><br/>* It looks like some of the connections have up to 3 favors, others have 1. I couldn't find a section for how to determine (when making up new NPCs) how many powers to give them.<br/><br/>* When generating the Mission Seed lines, do you write the relationship one-way, both-ways, or does it matter? Like, if I have the Investigator and the Cult (faction), can I just do:<br/>Investigator ------ pursuing -----&gt; Cult<br/><br/>, or should I do two lines of:<br/><br/>Investigator --------------------- pursuing -------------&gt; Cult<br/>Investigator &lt;---- needs his daughter for ritual--- Cult<br/><br/>Or does it matter?<br/><br/>* When you randomly select plot nodes (as per The Master Table section), do you only do that for the Mission Seed, or do you randomly add plot nodes for other reasons as well?<br/><br/>* Re Connection Tables on 41: Not sure I understand the part about "If the connection you are using is not associated to another node..." Does this mean in a situation where we added it to the Plot Map (because we owed the Cyberdoc/Loan shark for their Favor) but its just floating out there?<br/><br/>* Motivating Factors, p58: We were wracking our brains as to why a basic courier job would net 5 Kred while risky VIP protection is only 2-5. But then realized the 5 Kred courier job is for the group, not individually. Might want to note that.<br/><br/>* The LA transmission describes itself as this whole "hot new hollywood on one side, poverty and street gangs/violence on the other", however based on the Connections, Factions and Objects it had far more of a LA Confidential style (All Hollywood), with the street gangs/violence relegated to a Threat or two. I was kind of expecting a Seattle Sprawl scenario, and that's sort of what I had in mind when building the initial Map, but it played out more like a Hollywood pulp mystery. Might want to play that up more in the description.<br/><br/>CONTENTION...

It took us a bit to grasp the relationship between Unspent, Spent and "Dice that move to the GM/Player" Push Dice.<br/><br/>* Re Eric's comment on failure: We actually had about 4 Contentions, about 6-8 rolls total? But we didn't complete the full game. If we completed the full game, it might have worked out differently. So just note that we did do about 3 hours' worth. Might have just been cold dice, though. I think there were only two conflicts with Hurt dice used.<br/><br/>* In the game, the GM starts out with zero Push dice and players start out with 3 each: So by the first Contention in the game with one GM and 3 players, there are 9 Push dice on the table, 3 per player, correct?<br/><br/>* "Increase the Adjective's Severity": Can you only spend (that is, give to the GM) Push dice that you added through use of more Adjectives and were spent, or can you use any of them you have? Rules say the former, but wanted to confirm.<br/><br/>* The second item of Resolve the Roll is hard to consider: "If the attacker's result was equal or less... the attack happened as described but was not effective enough to inflict a new adjective".<br/>...but not sure how that works out with even some of the common attacks:<br/>Trying to outrun someone: Do you catch up to them anyway (in fiction), just can't add an adjective?<br/>Give someone the slip: Do you still completely get away anyway?<br/>By that description, it sounds like in the fiction that anything you try to do, you actually succeed at it no matter what, but "failure" simply means "I can't stamp it with an adjective".<br/><br/>Because of that, we couldn't figure out the best way to resolve some contentions.<br/>For example, in a secuction scenario, Coax vs Coax: "I make her fall in love with me".<br/>You roll but "fail": You still "make her fall in love with you", but you can't put an adjective on it.<br/>...but what does the antagonist do next? How do they get a turn next? The contention in the fiction is pretty much over at that point: The player didn't get an adjective, but they made what they want to happen Happen, so it doesn't seem to matter at that point.<br/><br/>Another scenario that came up: Anything that uses the Detect verb seems to be problematic:<br/>* If you want to for example determine the history of the hidden cult (faction), what do you roll against? Does that mean you have to stop and basically create one single new NPC, stat them out, then use them to represent the faction? Or use numbers to represent the faction? This is in a scenario where me as the GM simply didn't care if the PCs learned the faction history now or find it through connections later (it didn't kill or disrupt the scenario either way, both were valid), so Success was as good as Failure... but what does the PC roll against?<br/>- Also, as above with the "the attack happened as described... no adjective" piece, does that mean the PC automatically succeeds?<br/><br/>* A PC was looking for an NPC: I wanted to make it difficult, and didn't think that it needed to land one way or another (failure would not stop the game, etc) They were using Detect, but I couldn't decide the difficulty. I ended up using that NPC's natural Prowl, even though they weren't particularly trying to be avoided. Naturally, I couldn't think of a way to have the target "attack back" against the Detect roll.<br/><br/>I... think that was it actually. The Transmission we chose ended up building itself out like a murder mystery/LA Confidential type, so naturally there was lots of Detecting going on, moreso than fistfights, guns, cars, etc. There were a few Coax conflicts and one Move one as well.<br/><br/>I'm sure we just had a mental misfire or something of some sort in reading the rules and it's all a lot more simple than it looks, but when we read the rules we kept getting hung up on the "Failure is actually Complete Success, you just don't get to add an Adjective". It led us to come up with ideas like:<br/>- Detect vs Prowl to find the Faction Headquarters building address. <br/>- You fail. OK, my turn to attack back: You find an address and drive out there, but when you show up to the site... Gangsters show up (sent by the faction) and are going to beat you up...<br/>...but this sounded like REALLY hippie, moreso than the rest of the game feels, so I think that interpretation was too liberal.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328425/#Comment_328425" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T06:49:14+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  6:49AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great, Andy. Really good feedback to work with.<br/><br/>While I'm going to try to address as much as I can in a revision at some point, I'm going to answer your specific questions now.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>* I'm not sure about the rules for actually adding more stuff to the Map. Do you only do it when you hit up NPCs and roll on their charts?<br/><br/>* When you randomly select plot nodes (as per The Master Table section), do you only do that for the Mission Seed, or do you randomly add plot nodes for other reasons as well?</blockquote>\nYou can feel free to roll on the master table and another node whenever you feel like you need something else in your plot. But I think it's more fun to so by leaning on connections. That's the "investigation" rules for the game. Rather than rolling to see if you can find clues, you randomly roll a clue a connection tells you about and it becomes part of the mystery. Feels more noir to me.\n<blockquote>* On the character sheet, you should fill in the first dot on each box. You basically are told to do that in the rules, but having it done for you (since there are no "zeros" under the Actions/Verbs) just makes sense.</blockquote>\nMy reasons for not doing this are purely aesthetic. Those dots wouldn't look the same as the dots you fill in yourself. Plus, what if you wanted to do a hack where you're playing androids and the GM says start with -1 Coax and +1 Hack or something. But this is easily solvable because we live in the future. I can add those filled in dots in their own layer in acrobat and people can turn it off or on as they wish.\n<blockquote>* While others thought the relationship adjectives were limited ("they don't push me"), I liked them: Some are weak, some are very strong. So you don't have to have a really brilliant/heated relationship with everyone you know, but you can choose to do so.<br/>One thing: They don't spell out: For "lustful/obsessive/etc" (all of them), is it Protagonist to NPC? NPC to Protagonist? Both? Player's choice? We decided it was two-way, but something like obsessive or protective or dependent might be hard to portray both-way (Well, dependent is kinda easy: Listen to NIN as you play).</blockquote>\nThe relationship adjectives are how that protagonist feels about their connection. How the connection feels back is completely up to the GM. I'll make that more clear in the text.\n<blockquote>* I don't believe that the Transmission Connections/NPC's column of "Connected vs Unconnected" was explained in the rules, but I might have missed that.<br/><br/>*  Re Connection Tables on 41: Not sure I understand the part about "If the connection you are using is not associated to another node..." Does this mean in a situation where we added it to the Plot Map (because we owed the Cyberdoc/Loan shark for their Favor) but its just floating out there?</blockquote>\nSo, the Connections Table subsection on page 41 of the old doc, page 43 now. I just forgot to use the words "connected" and "unconnected" when I described it. I'm actually hoping to find a better term for it. Basically, if the connection is on the plot map and has a line connecting him to another node, then use the connected column. If he's doesn't have a line or if he's not on the map at all, use "unconnected." I will try to make that more clear.\n<blockquote>* Might want to make it clearer that "unless you actually IMPLANT the gear, you basically carry it around in your pants." It actually wasn't super-clear until I confirmed the rules and dropped that "pants line" above. Might want to also recount that in the cyberware gear area: "Reminder: It costs 5 Kred (or a favor to a Splicer connection) to actually implant it, otherwise you simply carry it around."</blockquote>\nI'm not clear on this. Are you talking about implants specifically? \n<blockquote>* It looks like some of the connections have up to 3 favors, others have 1. I couldn't find a section for how to determine (when making up new NPCs) how many powers to give them.</blockquote>\nFavors are pretty arbitrary. I just made sure they had the ones most appropriate to their characters. Obviously ones like shark and splice are going to be considered more powerful than date and ride, so that might have been part of my reasoning behind how I balanced it, but I can't say I had a formula for it.\n<blockquote>* When generating the Mission Seed lines, do you write the relationship one-way, both-ways, or does it matter?</blockquote>\nDoesn't matter. The only "rule" is that you draw a line between them. How you label that line is for your own sake to remind you what it means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328426/#Comment_328426" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T06:59:49+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  6:59AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Obviously ones like shark and splice are going to be considered more powerful than date and ride...</blockquote>\nHeh.

It took us a bit to grasp the relationship between Unspent, Spent and "Dice that move to the GM/Player" Push Dice.</blockquote>\nYes. Those are coming. At some point.\n<blockquote>* Re Eric's comment on failure: We actually had about 4 Contentions, about 6-8 rolls total? But we didn't complete the full game. If we completed the full game, it might have worked out differently. So just note that we did do about 3 hours' worth. Might have just been cold dice, though. I think there were only two conflicts with Hurt dice used.</blockquote>\nIt's really easy to win rolls in this game. Most good defense ratings are 3 or 4. It's pretty easy to count on a 4.1 or higher once you're rolling four or five dice. Failure is going to happen when you don't have Push and your opponent does. Push are more powerful defensively than they are offensively (not counting Push's ability to increase severity). So as a GM you have some ability to manage success and failure of the protagonists based on whether you keep the Push dice for yourself or dish them back to the players. I think the game sings best when the GM spends those dice back as fast as she gets them.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you did anything wrong, I'm just thinking out-loud. I think it's an interesting emerging tactic and I'm trying to figure out what I can say in the text so people don't have to learn this the hard way.\n<blockquote>* In the game, the GM starts out with zero Push dice and players start out with 3 each: So by the first Contention in the game with one GM and 3 players, there are 9 Push dice on the table, 3 per player, correct?</blockquote>\nYes. I've done tests where more Push dice can enter the economy or where you start with more Push. Bad things happen if you do this. The dice end up pooling in front of the GM because he can't spend as many as are coming in. 3 per player seems to be the magic number.\n<blockquote>* "Increase the Adjective's Severity": Can you only spend (that is, give to the GM) Push dice that you added through use of more Adjectives and were spent, or can you use any of them you have? Rules say the former, but wanted to confirm.</blockquote>\nThe former. Only what was in your roll and didn't get eliminated by Hurt dice.\n<blockquote>* The second item of Resolve the Roll is hard to consider: "If the attacker's result was equal or less... the attack happened as described but was not effective enough to inflict a new adjective".<br/>...but not sure how that works out with even some of the common attacks:<br/>Trying to outrun someone: Do you catch up to them anyway (in fiction), just can't add an adjective?<br/>Give someone the slip: Do you still completely get away anyway?<br/>By that description, it sounds like in the fiction that anything you try to do, you actually succeed at it no matter what, but "failure" simply means "I can't stamp it with an adjective".</blockquote>\nSo, the action still happened the way you wanted it to, but the consequences aren't what you wanted. So if I say, "I swing at the guy and hit him across his jaw. I want to make him <i>bruised</i>," and then I fail the roll, that means that I still swung and hit him, it just wasn't hard enough to bruise him.<br/><br/>If I say, "I recite my epic poem of love for her. I want to make her <i>infatuated</i> with me," and I fail, I still recite the poem, it just wasn't enough to make her infatuated.\n<blockquote>Another scenario that came up: Anything that uses the Detect verb seems to be problematic:<br/>* If you want to for example determine the history of the hidden cult (faction), what do you roll against? Does that mean you have to stop and basically create one single new NPC, stat them out, then use them to represent the faction? Or use numbers to represent the faction? This is in a scenario where me as the GM simply didn't care if the PCs learned the faction history now or find it through connections later (it didn't kill or disrupt the scenario either way, both were valid), so Success was as good as Failure... but what does the PC roll against?<br/>- Also, as above with the "the attack happened as described... no adjective" piece, does that mean the PC automatically succeeds?<br/><br/>* A PC was looking for an NPC: I wanted to make it difficult, and didn't think that it needed to land one way or another (failure would not stop the game, etc) They were using Detect, but I couldn't decide the difficulty. I ended up using that NPC's natural Prowl, even though they weren't particularly trying to be avoided. Naturally, I couldn't think of a way to have the target "attack back" against the Detect roll.</blockquote>\nFor your first example, I wouldn't make that a roll. I haven't really addressed investigation outside of leaning on your connections. I think you should go GUMSHOE on that stuff. If they're in the right place with the right verbs, adjectives, objects and/or training programs, you should just tell them what they need to know. As the GM, you're instigating: driving the plot towards contentions. If the clue helps drive the story that way, then perfect. If obfuscating the clue does that better, then maybe go that way.<br/><br/>For your second example, that sounds a bit more appropriate. You'd definitely want to think about what kind of adjective you're inflicting if that succeeds. <i>Marked</i>? <i>Spotted</i>? <i>Followed</i>? <i>Paranoid</i>? And how that consequences warrants the target rolling a Hurt die for it. I need to come up with some good Detect roll examples. I agree that verb is probably the most problematic.<br/><br/>Thanks again Eric, Mark, and Andy.

"Coax: I make her fall in love with me" is too far, we need to pull it back to simple tasks on the path to a larger goal like "Coax: In the end I want her to fall in love with me, so I'm going to make small talk now. I'm aiming for *smitten*." (Roll)<br/><br/>* Quick followup: Damn, I can't remember the context exactly now, but I had an antagonist basically talk to Mark's CyberMarketingGuy, and I think it was a Coax contention of some kind (I was basically narrating it as someone counter-hacking Mark's character: "Your defenses are breached, he's trying to wipe out the files you're sending to others"), Mark was trying to decide how much Push dice to use to defend, so he asked me what the Adjective was that I was trying to tag him with.<br/>However, looking at the sequence, looks like Adjective tagging comes in the end, after all the attack and defense is resolved, and there's no impetus to state the adjective being used. I got the sense that I could tell him if I wanted to, but if I didn't want to that too was entirely an option, that he'd simply have to trust me. I said that last part with a big grin, doing the "evil professor arches his fingers" thing. Well, antagonist got his ass kicked by defense so it didn't happen anyway, but still. <br/>So I was wondering, in that case was I supposed to say right off the bat what I was aiming to tag him with? Or can I actually hold that back until the actual tagging phase of conflict which comes later? Reason I ask is, that based on the results of the roll, I might change the adjective slightly. Like in the above "Coax to charm" scenario above, I make it clear that I'm going for seduction: If I narrowly eke out a victory, I might go with Smitten, but if I totally dominate the opponent that seems that the result would be stronger, like "totally infatuated/in love" or something.<br/>Alternately, declaring that you have to say the adjective up front, and narrow victory vs totally bowling over means the same thing, that would be cool too: It simply means you have to be careful what you are describing as the adjective then, the more forceful it is, the more the player may try to resist.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite>I think you should go GUMSHOE on that stuff. If they're in the right place with the right verbs, adjectives, objects and/or training programs, you should just tell them what they need to know.</blockquote>\n* Yeah, this is totally normally my contention as well: Does it advance the game? THEN IT HAPPENS, and the person with the most "stuff on the sheet" pointed to that element is the one who gets the clues. Gumshoe was a huge influence on the way I run other games.<br/><br/>My only thought was that it doesn't seem like there's a lot of places to use Detect actively then, other than a defense against Prowl or Hack. Given that the other 8 verbs seem to be usable in both attack/defense situations, the character with 2 in "Investigator" will likely receive clues but simply not use that actual Verb as much except to ward off ambushes and stuff.<br/><br/>Might be totally a minor thing tho, I haven't played enough to form a solid opinion yet.<br/><br/>If it hadn't been made plain by our comments thus far, we're basically now like little anime characters surrounded by a "soul fire aura", burning to play another session soon. The game has been really fun, so thanks for helping out with the interim answers!<br/><br/>* Oh, just remembered one last thing: On the character sheet under Connections, there isn't a place to list their Favors. That would be helpful.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328466/#Comment_328466" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T10:16:42+00:00" title="June  8, 2011 10:16AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2011 10:18AM by Eric Provost.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy,<br/><br/>I'm having a couple of issues with page 86 in the 11.06.06 beta.<br/><br/>Aid - Cool and intiutive.  But not as helpfull as I'd like to be (when I'm trying to be helpful).<br/><br/>Set up - I really don't care for this rule.  Mostly because of the extra Action die it provides.  Granted, the extra Action die is clearly intended to make sure that Set Up is a decent strategic choice, but it stands out as a weak patch.<br/><br/>Ditch - Wait... what?  If my gun is [jammed], that'll affect my ability to punch someone?  Um... really?  And, if someone knocks my gun out of my hand via a disarm, I still have to spend an action to get rid of the [jammed] negative adjective?  I tut-tut at you, sir.<br/><br/><br/><br/>My hack-addiction is kicking in here.  This is the way I'd do it:<br/><br/>Aid - I aid my buddies in the conflict by passing them 1 of my Push dice (after narrating my assistance).  No roll.<br/><br/>Set Up - I'd just tear this out without any replacement.  In fact, I challenge you to provide a narrative situation where Set Up is more appropriate than Attack or Recover is.  If I set a trap that hasn't sprung yet?  That's an attack with [unaware] as the adjective.  I duck for cover &amp; reload?  I wouldn't unless I'd been hit with [out of ammo] first.<br/><br/>Ditch - Totally shouldn't be an action.  Just not using an object should be enough to avoid its negative adjectives. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The addiction continues....<br/><br/>Attack - A failed attack inflicts a fleeting negative adjective on the attacker.  Attacking player chooses the adjective.<br/><br/>Defend - Discharging Push dice to raise defense adds 0.1 to the defense rating, not 1.  This would need some playtesting, but it would eliminate pesky situations where it's impossible to win a roll (target's base defense + uncharged push dice = 7 or higher)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328468/#Comment_328468" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T10:27:37+00:00" title="June  8, 2011 10:27AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>I feel like I should clarifiy my position on the whiff-factor.

But the thing is, for Technoir, introducing a complication is what happens when you succeed. It seemed like adding something more to failure mechanically was heavier than the frame could handle\u2014especially since it doesn't happen often (or so I thought).<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean that things can't get more narratively tricky when you fail. I just punched a guy in the face, but it didn't hurt him. Oh, shit. What's he going to do now? I just bared my heart and soul to the girl I love, but she didn't care for it?

But as there's the vast possibilities of narrative outcomes that could lead up to, I haven't quite figured out how to codify that in a game yet.

Sometimes there have been one-and-done contentions, but they've just felt natural to the story line at that point so it hasn't felt like an issue. If the player was obviously exploiting something, I would just tell them they don't have a vector to create that adjective and ask them for something more reasonable. \n<blockquote>Restoration.

I play <i>Wushu</i> regularly with Dan Bayn and that's the group I did most of my playtesting with for <i>Technoir</i>. The "Principal of Narrative Truth" is pretty ingrained into our fabric of being at this point. If that's not your thing, you can dial it back.<br/><br/>But here's my philosophy behind it: <br/><br/>1) I think "I hit the guy in the face" is a more evocative narrative description than "I try to hit the guy in the face."<br/>2) As a GM, I don't want to step on my players' narrations. I don't want to say, "Actually, you don't hit the guy." I'd rather say "Yes, but it doesn't seem to hurt him very much."<br/><br/>But I realize and am thrilled that other groups do things differently. I don't think I make too much of a hard sell on this method. You can adjust it to how your group normally handles these things pretty easily I think.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328643/#Comment_328643" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T18:02:33+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  6:02PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like we may be on to play this weekend.

Emailed my feedback to Jeremy but thought I'd post it here as well for inquiring minds.<br/><br/><b>Date of playtest session:</b><br/>Friday, June 10th<br/><br/><b>Names of all players (as they would like to be credited):</b><br/>C. Edwards<br/>Jason Petrasko<br/>Shreyas Sampat<br/>Anders Smith<br/>Mike Holmes<br/><br/><b>How long did the session run?</b><br/>3-4 hours over IRC, which equals about 2-3 hours of face to face play<br/><br/><b>Which parts of the session were the most fun? Why?</b><br/>Everybody seemed to enjoy character creation for the most part. It's relatively quick yet dispenses nice little bursts of color and situation as you create your character. Not unlike a much simplified, and non-random, version of character creation in Mongoose Publishing's edition of Traveller. The beta pdf is not the most easily referenced thing right now, but that's sort of the nature of the beast. There were some minor issues with understanding how the tagging system works when buying gear and splicing an implant being a separate, added cost.<br/><br/>The contention we played out was enjoyable and the mechanics felt like they were a fun multiplier and not an ungainly yet necessary anchor. I feel like there is a definite improvement here over the resolution system in Chronica Feudalis for ease of use and return for time invested.<br/><br/><b>Which parts of the session were the least fun? Why?</b><br/>Hmm, besides my spotty internet connection giving me the <i>vexed</i> adjective? I think that despite the enjoyment of character creation there was a general sentiment that there could be just a little more meat on the bones. A little more flavor, personality, or background for players to work with in getting the feel of their characters. That didn't stop the players from portraying their characters as distinct and flavorful in play though, not at all. <br/><br/><b>Did you play out a full contention? How did it end?</b><br/>We did! A pretty simple, but fun, Hacking contention. It was a good, non-critical, situation that I could use so that everybody could get familiar with the mechanics. It consisted of 5 rolls all together, 4 by players and 1 by myself in the role of a banking system's firewall and countermeasure software.<br/><br/>The adjective system was fun and quick, giving an easy sort of short-hand language for hard modifiers that was plugged directly into the fiction. We had <i>overclocked</i> created with an Aid roll by one of the hackers to back his partner's play, <i>outmanuevered</i> created by the other hacker as she danced her way through security protocols, <i>flagged</i> created by the banking system as it attempted to lock down some accounts, <i>drained</i> as the hackers emptied the accounts they were hacking, and <i>disconnected</i> in order to pull back out before the system could try and snare them with a backtrace.<br/><br/>The contention system helped created a beneficial tension for even this minor situtation. I'm interested in seeing how it holds out over extended use. I could see how altering the turn order would have altered the dynamic of the contention as well. In the end the PC's got away with the goods free and clear, but it took some teamwork to do so.<br/><br/>As the GM, I'd like there to be a little more meat in the Transmissions. Not much mind, just an extra bite or two. Maybe a general situation chart that I could then apply to my seed nodes in a way that makes sense or works for me. The seed nodes provide me with raw materials, but usually what I have trouble with is coming up with an initial situation that is dynamic and engaging. If I had some situations presented to me, along with the material already on the Master Chart for a Transmission, I'd feel a lot more confident in being able to just pick up and run the game.<br/><br/><b>Did you use a transmission? Which one?</b><br/>Yep. Los Angeles Sprawl.<br/><br/><b>Did you make a plot map? Did it provide you with content to use in game?</b><br/>I made two. The first one I made when we did the character creation thing on Wednesday. But we had some player switch around so I decided to make a new one.<br/><br/>The first one left me feeling sort of stumped as to how to connect the seeds. I had some vague sort of handwavey stuff, but really wasn't sure what to do with it. The second one gave me some hot ideas pretty quickly and feels like it is going to shape up to be a pretty layered intrigue.<br/><br/>I feel that the difference, at least partly, has to do with a location I rolled in the second map suggesting an actual event. I didn't roll any Events in either one, but I think the implicit inclusion of an event in the second map really helped push my imagination over into fruitful territory.<br/><br/><b>Were any rules or procedures confusing? Which ones? What was confusing?</b><br/>Some minor confusion during character creation that I already mentioned. That's all I recall, the game went very smoothly overall.<br/><br/><b>Did you use house rules or modify the results of the rules in any way?</b><br/>Not really. The only thing we altered was reversing the turn order in the last round of Connection adjective choosing so that the person who was going last for the first few rounds would get a little more choice.<br/><br/><b>What else should I know?</b><br/>One thing that might be cool to include in Transmissions, or maybe even the Player's Guide, is a way to create some background for your character beyond Connections. Maybe a chart of random events you roll on for your character that have an effect on how they are plugged into the fiction, or some further way to create initial ties into the fiction that evoke the flavor of a particular Transmission.<br/><br/>Oh, and more gear and stuff. Lots more. I recall someone mentioning lifestyle costs as well. I second and third that recommendation.<br/><br/>That's all I have for now. We should be playing again soon and if we have anything to add or any opinions have changed I'll let you know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329188/#Comment_329188" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T20:19:59+00:00" title="June 11, 2011  8:19PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had an interesting thing come up in our extended play today. Eric (who was GMing this time) will be posting the full details later, but...<br/><br/>...the rules basically say that Contention ends when you Give In, or when you can no longer act because the hurt die took out all your other dice...<br/><br/>...has anyone ever had that happen? I realized that in all the contentions we played out, it eventually lead to one side or another giving in eventually. When I looked down at the dice (say a protagonist or antagonist with a verb rated "3"), and the amount of hurt dice inflicted that still were not completely taking out all the verb dice... It seemed that it would take several, several rounds (at least double the verb's dice worth of rounds, if not more) to end up in a condition where an antagonist was removed due to hurt dice cancelling out all the verb dice. It seemed kinda astronomical outside of the 1-die verb, actually. <br/><br/>Not sure if we were reading the rules wrong or something, but it seems that either one side gives in, or else a conflict goes on for far more rounds than intended in order to do the "pushed out by hurt dice" resolution to a contention (since you can still stay in the contention even if you fail and all).<br/><br/>So has anyone ever seen an antagonist or protagonist with a 3 or higher rated verb taken out of a conflict with hurt dice, and not by giving in?<br/><br/>Just wondering.

In the hacking contention I mentioned in my last post, I basically went with the fiction and when one of the protagonists gave their opponent an adjective that would logically end the contention, well, it ended. I can see how that may be less likely to happen than giving in, especially against other people and not a security system.<br/><br/>There is a section in the rules where Jeremy talks about the basic behavior of antagonists in this regard depending upon how high up the food chain they are; henchmen, heavies, etc. I think that between the Contention section, the Playing The Opposition section, and the play examples, I took away that giving in or contention ending adjective assignments would be the way most contentions are resolved.<br/><br/><br/>*edited to add: After going back and checking the pdf I see this covered under the Ending The Contention section on page 88.<br/>\n<blockquote>ENDING THE CONTENTION<br/>Contentions don\u2019t have to play out until everyone dies, though some con-<br/>tentions may end that way. Usually it is time to end a contention when it<br/>is obvious that one side has achieved what they want, either through the<br/>narrative consequences of the inflicted adjectives or because the other side<br/>is too beat-up to stop them any more. But if neither side backs down, play<br/>until one side is eliminated by give-ins, force-outs, and death.</blockquote>\nSo I suspect that, with the way I GM, a lot of contentions will probably end through inflicted adjectives. With giving in being the less used alternative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329236/#Comment_329236" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T10:00:20+00:00" title="June 12, 2011 10:00AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2011 10:29AM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My mistake, I guess. That's what I meant by "giving in," for what it's worth \u2014 the GM or player gives in after an adjective is inflicted that naturally or logically ends the conflict in the fiction. So the <i>downed</i> helicopter might still continue to be the basis of a fight, if the gunship's henchmen still want to operate the guns in the wreckage, or they might give up and scatter or surrender once the helicopter is put on the earth. Depends on the scene and the situation. Adjectives give the players (including the GM) the information to decide when enough's enough.<br/><br/>This is a great thread, by the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329292/#Comment_329292" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T19:58:45+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  7:58PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bad Eric!

One reason I dig Otherkind-inspired resolution is that you have somewhat of a safety net in being able to decide which die results to assign to particular outcomes. The player gets to pick their own poison.<br/><br/>So I started thinking about what sort of hackage I might apply if the mechanism for PC death falls flat for me. The easiest solution I thought of was to just institute the option for an active defense roll for PCs when death is on the line and they have no Push dice. The defending player would roll the appropriate Verb dice + any Hurt dice. If their roll was equal to or greater than their opponent's roll they would avoid death and all the Push dice used by their opponent would transfer to them. That puts some risk into going for the kill and adds the possibility for some interesting table turning. I'm not sure if there should be some adjective fallout for the defending PC, I'm leaning towards not but trying it in play may change that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
