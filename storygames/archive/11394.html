Most games that I've been in have not really ended, in the sense that a story ends. One of the following often happens.<br/><br/>1) The game peters out because the GM or some players lost interest in the game and want to play something else<br/>2) Variation on (1): The game is "wrapped up" very quickly just to give it a "proper" ending, leaving everyone unsatisfied (more on this below)<br/>3) The characters die (this was more back in the days of playing "traditional" rpgs)<br/><br/>Another aspect of this is that I used to play games without the *intention* of them ending, or the end seemed so far off that it was not worth thinking about. Think Rolemaster/MERP, and the characters want to get as high up in levels as they can... This was back in my teens.<br/><br/>Nowadays, I prefer games that are planned to be shorter term campaigns, just so they can get to a satisfying end with some reliability.<br/><br/>So, two questions: Once you are running a game, and you want to end it (due to whatever reasons, see (1) above), how do you make it come to a good, satisfying end without the players feeling like the GM has railroaded them, and with proper story gravitas that makes everyone feel like it really is *their* ending?<br/><br/>Second question: How do you plan your game before it starts to make sure it will eventually come to a good ending? I have a feeling that this is really the trick to avoid the problems mentioned above, but it still seems hard to plan out the story ahead of time in a way that will very likely lead to a satisfying outcome.<br/><br/>More specifically, I am running a Burning Wheel game. I think next session will be the tenth, and I want to try making it the final session. It's been pretty fun, but there are <a href="http://rpgmusings.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/burning-wheel-and-my-love-hate-relationship-with-it/" rel="nofollow">some things that are not working for me</a>, both in terms of rules and in terms of "world burning", i.e. how we came up with setting and situation. Plus I really want to play some other games (Mortal Coil is first on the list), and the players are on board with that.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel actually seems unusually hard to end, for two reasons. First, the characters all have Beliefs (and associated goals). Ideally, they would all fulfill their most important goals at the same time right at the end. This seems almost impossible. Secondly, BW is set up to make the characters fail a lot, and failure drives the story on by creating twists and complications. But that creates more plot and makes the game go on *longer*, whereas I need the opposite. I need them to succeed so the game can end, basically.<br/><br/>So, how do you end a game without railroading? Have most of your games ended with most of the players walking away satisfied with the ending? I'd appreciate any thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253733/#Comment_253733" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T10:03:57+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 10:03AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may be difficult to end your current BW game in a clean, fun manner next session.  It's best if the players have as much heads up as possible.<br/><br/>I've had a lot of luck with this method, though it will only help you going forward.  When world-burning, the group should name an event that will mark the end of the current arc.  Some example events: an election for the governor of a colony, the opening of a dimensional rift, a referendum on establishing a mage guild, a final confrontation with the pirates, etc.  Do not choose a conditional event (e.g. - I will kill the king), since conditions change pretty frequently during play.  Along with an event, the group should estimate how many sessions they would like to occur before the event (I find 6-8 sessions works pretty well).<br/><br/>Whatever event the group chooses, they should agree that whatever happens in play cannot stop it from happening.  However, the unwritten details of the event may be affected, and there should be a ton of wiggle room.  For example, influencing the results of an vote, preparing for and winning the battle against the pirates, procuring a device that will heal the rift between dimensions, etc.<br/><br/>Each player should have at least one belief about the end-of-arc event until the event occurs.  The session during which the event occurs is the last session.  If the game continues, do another world-burning, keeping the facts established during prior arcs and deciding on a new end event.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253754/#Comment_253754" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T10:44:34+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 10:44AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the thing with the end of a BW game, it might not end in success.<br/><br/>The kid who wanted to become ascend the throne might not fail in the final battle in the throne room, might be sold into slavery or locked away in a tower.<br/><br/>The wizard's apprentice might never get revenge on their master, might end up being a runaway apprentice with only vague control of their growing arcane power and no tower to call their own.<br/><br/>I have seen player characters fail in spectacular ways and I have seen them gain successes that the player never, ever saw coming very early in the game.<br/><br/>Our games end when the situation is resolved, and by situation I mean a larger conflict, something that is the driving force of the whole campaign.

It's just that failure during the game normally just means that there are some complications, not that the character's goal will ultimately fail. <br/><br/>I wonder if it would be a good idea to have "one big roll" at the end, some kind of critical situation that determines the ultimate fate of the character. At this point, the character really can fail. As opposed to piling on complications and twists until the characters finally succeed.<br/><br/>I like how some games have a formal "epilogue" mechanic (e.g. <i>carry</i>, <i>Fiasco</i>)...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253778/#Comment_253778" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T11:37:06+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 11:37AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><br/>Our games end when the situation is resolved, and by situation I mean a larger conflict, something that is the driving force of the whole campaign.

Our BW/Beliefs formula seems to be:<br/><br/>1 Belief centered around a larger conflict campaign goal: our current WFRP 3e game using Beliefs is centered around the group locating and freeing a child who has been proclaimed Sigmar reborn, one of the PCs wants to kill the child, another wants to free him and then hide him away in the depths of the empire, and another wants to see him ascend to the seat of Emperor.<br/><br/>1 Belief centered around a smaller, personal conflict which can be achieved within 2 sessions roughly: same campaign for example, "I will locate the Elf maiden Alandria and force her to love me."  The Elf PC is not going to chase this woman around all campaign, that would be boring, so this will likely be resolved soon.<br/><br/>1 General Belief, don't think I need an example here.<br/><br/>When the campaign comes to a close the group will have decided at least 2 full sessions before-hand where we are heading so everyone's on the same page.  As a GM, I may have very roughly mapped out in my head where the end point will occur.  Using our previous example, I have a rough idea that the PC's will travel into the Northern World's Edge mountains and locate a lost Elven standard before heading into Kislev and confronting the Chaos horde who captured the Sigmar reborn Child.  No idea how many sessions this will encompass or what will occur though.<br/><br/>Typically, the campaign will end after the child is found and the common enemy is defeated, but not before the PCs confront each other as they each have specific tasks they wish to accomplish related to the same Belief.  These are at odds so glorious inter-party conflict will occur and blood may be spilled.  We usually end the campaign right there, one of the PCs may have fled in abject horror and disbelief, one may be laying on the ground bleeding out from a wound inflicted by his former ally, and the other will finish up by driving his broadsword into the back of the 9 year old boy who thinks he's Sigmar.  Camera pans out from the carnage and roll credits.  <br/><br/>How does this always seem to work for us?  We discussed the rough ending before we started the campaign.  We don't know if there will really be a fight over the child but we know the group will find the child likely in Northern Kislev in the clutches of the chaos horde.  Everything leading up to that moment is character development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253872/#Comment_253872" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T16:47:43+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  4:47PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to end my campaing nicely but it\xe5s a while away.

I think maybe <b>that</b> is my problem: Too much stuff going on at the same time, and a Situation that's not sufficiently clear-cut.<br/><br/>We started with <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?8442-[BW]-Darkness-Gathers" rel="nofollow">this background writeup</a>.<br/><br/>The important bit is:<br/><br/><i>A prophet has arrived in one of the smaller towns in the valley. Some rumors say that the gods are listening to him, and he will save us all. Others say that his followers are turning odd, and that he is bringing more evil to the valley. The White Hand has not heard of him yet (or hasn't had the resources to stop him).<br/></i><br/><br/>Each player had a Belief about the prophet: One wants to bring him back to the city for questioning, one wants to kill him, one wants to recruit him in a struggle to bring down the nobility, etc.<br/><br/>So the players found the Prophet a couple of sessions ago, and this is where I had some trouble. I wanted some PC v. PC conflict, but it I failed to make the Prophet character really ambiguous. It was pretty clear that he was "evil", so all the players are now united against him. Ok, that's fine too, and they all have different approaches to defeating him.<br/><br/>Then there's a couple of other major conflicts going on:<br/>- Orcs are attacking the valley, and they have now all but surrounded the city.<br/>- The PCs have found some Ancient tablets that can be used to re-activate the "Sentinels"; guard stones that can supposedly protect the valley from Orcs and such.<br/><br/>And several personal goals are in play:<br/>- One PC is trying to find her missing (since a long time) son. According to another PC's failed Symbology roll in interpreting the tablets, this child has a special ability, and his blood is needed to activate the sentinels (!).<br/>- One PC is about to be led in chains into the city by "The White Hand" (the inquisition, basically). They are being followed by a large group of followers that he has gathered while preaching heretical beliefs around the valley.<br/><br/>Oh, and there's also an army of undead that the Prophet has raised...<br/><br/>LOL. It does all fit together a bit better than this post makes it sound like, and I have some ideas on how things could go down in the last sessio, but I do think I have to be a little bit heavy-handed with the scene framing to get things to a conclusion that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253928/#Comment_253928" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T11:05:57+00:00" title="January 30, 2010 11:05AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, you are saying go down in the last session" as if you know when exactly that will be.

During play, various new plot devices come up (through player initiative, failure complications, etc). It seems to me like you want to have a number of more-or-less "open" plot threads in play at any time. If these new plot threads keep cropping up, you will get a plot that gets larger and larger, or more and more complicated. So at some point in the middle you start to bring them together, so that sub-plots can be "closed"; it turns out they were a part of the main plot after all, and right at the end, things can be intensely focused into one big scene where everything gets determined. For example, as I mentioned above, one PC's "find my son" belief turns out to be related to another's "re-activate the Sentinels" belief. I, as a GM, weaved these two threads together. But generally, I find this to be pretty difficult.<br/><br/>Hmm, I think this makes more sense in my head, and maybe I'm just over-complicating things. <br/><br/>I do appreciate the advice in this thread so far, it's been helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253931/#Comment_253931" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T11:13:37+00:00" title="January 30, 2010 11:13AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my take on it from a while back:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7806&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Link</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253932/#Comment_253932" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T11:13:42+00:00" title="January 30, 2010 11:13AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so this has been decided in advance that the game will end in ten session.

This usually means that I will bring the main plotline to a conclusion. I recently did this with the 3.5 campaign I was running, and we were going to transition to a new plotline with the same characters. For the transition, I decided to run a classic dungeon delve to sort of take a break from the high intrigue and espionage theme that the main plotline had had. However, I am struggling with getting the enthusiasm going and considering calling the whole thing off. I think part of it is that I've been working on some new setting ideas with bySwarm, and I've also been looking at some other systems that look interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you just decide it's time to call it off and move along to something else?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
