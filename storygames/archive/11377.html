I figured this thread was going to be non-fiction, but part of me was hoping for a discussion of setting RPGs in prison. Like...dunno...Oz the RPG or something.</blockquote>\nThe only game I can think of that directly addresses this kind of thing is Jared Sorensen's little gaming exercise, <a href="http://www.memento-mori.com/other/games/fourwalls.pdf" rel="nofollow">Four Walls and a Funeral</a>, which is a semi-serious look at playing in the setting.<br/><br/>On the surface it seems like gaming prison life would be full of game-worthy incident.  You have your gang activity, your stabbings and beatings and your ever-popular rape, but if you want to get down into the truth of things, the biggest part of prison life is boredom.  Soul-stripping, agonizing boredom.  In prison you have a lot of time and not a lot of things to fill that time with.<br/><br/>If you read the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375726624" rel="nofollow">Newjack: Guarding Sing-Sing</a>, you know that realistic prison drama, anyway, revolves around stuff like who gets an extra shower that week.  Not exactly the sort of thing that makes for compelling roleplay.<br/><br/>So when we talk about gaming prison life we're definitely talking about an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow">Oz</a> sort of situation, with a lot of outsized happenings that don't have much in common with real prisoners and their problems.  Is this okay when the alternative is saying stuff like, "I sit in my cell for a few hours doing nothing.  Then I do push-ups.  I read a magazine."?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253414/#Comment_253414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T08:45:03+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  8:45AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see <i>Contenders</i> being hacked pretty easily (though the "fight scene" would have to be more amorphous and flexible, to include social conflicts, too). You got Hope, Pain, Cash, Rep, and Techniques (again, drift the Techniques some, to open up conflict types).<br/><br/>I'm also reminded of just how many adventure game/modules play the "OK, you regain consciousness in a dank dungeon cell, stripped of all your gear." But that's more like <i>Escape: the RPG</i> than <i>Oz: the RPG</i>.<br/><br/>Might be kind of interesting, though.

(Two sessions for character creation and 9 sessions of play.) Here\u2019s a thumbnail of the game we set up, so you can see how flexible Sorcerer is in terms of setting and detail.<br/><br/>The game was called The Brotherhood. It was set in a state penitentiary, and Lore was all about the brutality of prison life.<br/><br/>Humanity was the ability to play by your own rules and not the rules of the system. Lore was acts of domination and submission. Demons were shivs, tattoos, cell blocks, drugs and so on. If your Humanity reached 0 you were a creature of prison, acting only in terms of domination and submission, never able to connect to another as a person.<br/><br/><b>David King</b> was in jail for murdering the lawyer of the cult leader who had executed his daughter from behind bars.<br/><b>Visili</b> was a lifer (by choice) who had a cell block for a demon and never wanted to leave.<br/><b>Roman</b> was a convicted ex-cop who had murdered his own partner in an attempt to hide his dark deeds.<br/><br/>Each had learned the Lore in order to survive \u2014 or, in the case of the guy with the dead daughter \u2014 to get access to the cult leader and murder him.<br/><br/><b>David\u2019s bound demons</b> were a tattooed third eye on his forehead, and the tattoo of a gun on his arm.<br/><b>Visili\u2019s demon</b> was the cell block he had lived in for the last 30 years.<br/><b>Roman\u2019s demon</b> was a series of tattoos that covered his body that showed up after he beat the crap out of someone, with each tattoo showing an image of the beating.<br/><br/><b>David\u2019s Kicker</b> was that he discovers his daughter was still alive.<br/><b>Visili\u2019s Kicker</b> was that another sorcerer was making a moving to take control of his demon from him.<br/><b>Roman's Kicker</b> discovered a member of his crew had betrayed him and set him up for a hit.<br/><br/>Carver, the Cult Leader, wanted to remain in his prison cell where he was safe. The only problem was, his great-great grandfather had started the cult, using the slave labor that built the prison as the first cycle of domination and submission to summon demons. The cult members sacrificed people -- but the best sacrifices were members of the bloodline. So the great-great grandfather, a lich living in the tunnels under the prison, plotted to find and sacrifice Carver. Carver was trying to gather gangs in the prison to put his great-great grandfather down. Thus, the cycle of abuse and domination that started in the cult family is sewn into the social structure of the prison.<br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/>As for Sam's points about prison life being dull... True. But that's not what I aim for when I play games. I play to make stories. As Hitchcock said, "Movies are real life with the boring parts taken out."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
