I can honestly never think of a situation where I have used battlemaps and the strict boardgamey rules.<br/><br/>In retrospect, that probably means I have always been a Story-Gamer.  I've always been much more interested in the whys and whats of the story and not the hows of combat.  (My one exception is Champions - we loved the hex map for Champions combat in college).<br/><br/>So to more directly answer your question, I've played in some wildly successful D&amp;D games without miniatures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_57882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57882/#Comment_57882" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T12:39:23+00:00" title="February 23, 2007 12:39PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be honest we rarely (my old HS Group) rarely used minis at all, not in normal play.<br/><br/>we did do the mapping thing, graph paper, when we were in our dungeon crawling mode.<br/><br/>We didnt really get into using counters or minis or maps until we mostly migrated to Champions and it was a heck of a lot more useful for superhero battles.<br/><br/>Otherwise for me, i kept track of the fights when they occurred in my head, etc. Or jot little notes down.<br/><br/>At this time, were i to run a 3.0/3.5/d20Modern game,unless it was like a "Show us what is happening" sort of deal I would not use minis to speak of at this time. Unless it is Hero System or some other superhero game when there is an actual brawl going on, then it matters due to the genre much more so than in a Fantasy game. Come to think of it, a Spy Genre game might want more details, hallway maps with the detection devices in it, etc. But not fantasy for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_57883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57883/#Comment_57883" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T12:42:08+00:00" title="February 23, 2007 12:42PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2007 12:46PM by Sempiternity.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played with minis!<br/><br/>What we do is a) use a flowchart as the dungeon map, b) sketch out the encounter geography on a white board when we hit it, and then c) keep a running estimate of the distances in squares from each character after each move. <br/><br/>To be honest, we play it pretty fast and loose, with lots of negotiation about the exact positions breaking out when things get hectic. The last fight we had was on an ice covered floor against a white dragon, amid ice stalagtites - it was all like "I'm taking cover from the ice breath behind this pillar!" "Oh, really?

There's huge swaths of stuff that probably should be covered by some sort of rules that just ends up being handled by case-by-case DM fiat. <i>Hey, that guy's running away, do I get a free attack or something?</i> Also, the scale of 1"=10 feet is pretty lame.<br/><br/>As I understand them, the Red Box/Rules Cyclopedia assume you're <i>not</i> using minis.

And I think the using/having miniatures led to the more combats, rather than the other way around.  Sort of like, 'Hey, we've got these cool miniatures, let's put them out and use 'em!'  I like using miniatures especially because, to me, their use for combat scenes signals something important is about to happen.  I recently played in a Champions game without miniatures and the experience was underwhelming.  Fights were either handwaved, or devolved to a series of 'I attack/You attack' sequences in fight of attrition.

My method was similar to what I later saw recommended in Feng Shui. I would privately keep track of the relative positions of everything on a sheet of paper, behind the DM screen, and I would describe everything from the perspective of the players. When I later saw games being played with miniatures, counters, or with the "battle diagram" openly displayed on a blackboard, I thought it felt a lot less vivid and "you are there". (I still kinda dislike miniatures even though I <i>like</i> the tactical clarity and flat counters of games like <i>Melee</i> and <i>Dragonquest</i>.)<br/><br/>Note as someone wrote above, the tactical maneuvers of the older game weren't as finicky. I think I did apply common sense to the idea of what would happen if somebody tried to break off combat at full speed, i.e., the opponent would get a free final attack or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_57934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57934/#Comment_57934" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T17:47:45+00:00" title="February 23, 2007  5:47PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I played Red Box and 1st Edition AD&amp;D, we never used minis.

Occasionally maps were hosted and referenced, but they were not generally grid-maps, just 'general idea of the area' maps.<br/><br/>When I was running stuff, I usually had a sketched map on hand and often I had an actual grid-map which I used for personal reference. I described general distances to players, and in cases where it was tactically relevant I gave specific numbers -- how necessary this was usually depended on the tactical situation. For me, the reason I kept these references on hand was as a check against my own permissiveness -- in general, I was 'winging' it, but in cases where there were characters in the party who had movement-oriented abilities (monks, barbarians, etc.) I would try and pay more attention to keeping things 'fair.' But this just as often came in the form of letting them do cinematically-relevant things, not toning down everybody else's freedom of movement.<br/><br/>It's true that movement is often an important tactical element in D&amp;D fights -- but in my experience, it's not often a very interesting one, at least not at the level of 'is it 20 feet away or 25?'. The mapless approach also affected things like flanking (it became easier, as a rule) and ranged combat (cover and the like). Given that the norm on a MUSH is usually some form of Illusionism, it really didn't bother many players that I was often filtering things through the lens of GM fiat. I also feel like my experience, overall, was that the lack of miniatures simply led GMs towards framing different sorts of tactical challenges -- ones less tied to finicky concerns about location and more to an overall scene element.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_57978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57978/#Comment_57978" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-24T09:17:49+00:00" title="February 24, 2007  9:17AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of minis, we use a whiteboard and a scribbled, not-to-scale map, updated only when necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_57985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57985/#Comment_57985" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-24T09:58:19+00:00" title="February 24, 2007  9:58AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still am of the opinion that minis are not required.

If you ever end up running a 3.0/3.5 game without 'em, make sure your players are aware of this or at least let them shift their feat choices around later on if it turns out that the one they took isn't useful in your game!  And for old-school red-box style D&amp;D, man, I don't think there's anything that miniatures can actually do for you, except give you cool little figurines you can paint; I don't remember anything in the rules that is particularly geared towards their use.<br/><br/>I agree with Ryan about having more fun without the map and the minis.  Our miniatures-free 3.0 combat scenes were much faster, more free-wheeling, and typically all it took to keep everyone on the same page about everything's positions was to sketch out a quickie map on some scratch paper from time to time.  The idea of going back to maps+minis with all its headaches (like having to set up the map in the first place, and the incessant square-counting) just doesn't appeal to me at all anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58011/#Comment_58011" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-24T19:49:14+00:00" title="February 24, 2007  7:49PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tadk</cite><br/>Yes in Superheros, a map and counters or minis is Essential, but that is part and parcel of the genre.<br/>Fights in Fantasy novels tend to not be so detailed.<br/>My doubled pennies worth.</blockquote>\nThis boggles me.<br/><br/>Superheroes require minis, but dungeons and dragons doesn't?<br/><br/>To me, just the reverse.

My supers gaming is pretty much <i>Truth &amp; Justice</i> nowadays, and I'm all about describing awesome than playing on a map.  That, and I don't see how T&amp;J could work better on a map than without.  But then that gets me veering off on a tangent about how I just didn't like supers games until I played T&amp;J, because they were (at least the ones I tried playing) so, well, not about being a superhero.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>Now, with the maps and minis, I can create all kinds of gamey tactical situations.

HERO also distinguishes between combat and noncombat movement, ergo, you can run a supers battle pretty easily on a standard battlemat. M&amp;M, otoh, allows a PC to buy crazy amounts of movement for a pittance, so I can see how one would avoid a 'mat (even though, IMO, every other aspect of the system demands a 'mat). And something like T&amp;J, I'd think minis might actively get in the way.<br/><br/>To get back to Chris' question, I agree with others that old-school D&amp;D doesn't really suffer from eschewing minis. E.g., in AD&amp;D1e, combat movement other than the initial charge into melee (and the "free attack when you run away") is both irrelevant and nigh-undocumented. I'm guessing Red Box and RC is pretty similar. <br/><br/>You might want to sketch out the scene to aid in placing spells, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58247/#Comment_58247" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T08:15:57+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  8:15AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Champions, and yes, it had things set up for a battlegrid, but movement was cheap there too.

The PC's go there, poke around, find a dungeon, and start exploring. Story done, action starts.</blockquote>\nNot sure I really follow that, why is D&amp;D different to any other rpg in this regard?  We're playing it at the moment because it was a good ruleset for more tactical play which is part of the idea of the current game, but we don't roleplay any differently really playing this than we did when playing OtE.<br/><br/>I'm not sure there's anything in the game requires you to approach the balance of action and rp (assuming those are separate things, which I don't really think they are) that differently to any other game.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is different from a lot of other games (like OtE) in that the tactical rules for action-oriented scenes are much more detailed than they are for social-oriented scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58255/#Comment_58255" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T08:31:45+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  8:31AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>I played Champions, and yes, it had things set up for a battlegrid, but movement was cheap there too.

Noncombat movement is the only way any of the PCs would be able to cover the whole 'mat in one Phase. And with the Range Penalty, shooting at bigger ranges is pretty problematic w/o PSLs.<br/><br/>With M&amp;M, you buy movement in mph, iirc.

That's roughly the equivalent of minis.  These fights where we used maps were ones in which the terrain played a particularly tactical role.

I played OD&amp;D in my youth, but we didn't understand half of what we were doing. We owned and painted minis (I still have them), but I don't recall how we actually used them. I rediscovered D&amp;D when 3.5E came out. Then I discovered indie/story games.<br/><br/>I haven't played OD&amp;D lately, so I was curious how AP might work in a D&amp;D game (of any edition) without minis. I've read people bragging about playing D&amp;D without minis, but the 3.5E rules are so tactical/boardgamey. So I'm trying to wrap my head around OD&amp;D, which is crunchy/fiddly yet not boardgamey. &lt;:)<br/><br/>(sorry for the late response.

First we used minis+rough sketch -&gt;rough sketch with X's -&gt;Verbal description only. Lots of the pre- 3.x stuff didn't fully take advantage of the use of minis anyway. If you get a chance, take a look at some old modules like Keep on the Borderlands. Even though it uses maps, there really isn't a whole lot that really encourages minis use in itself.<br/><br/>Tactically, there are only a few things that might encourage minis use ( primarily spell effects and Hide in Shadows/Backstab combos), but not a lot really, and not much that really requires the use. We got away with a few really basic Standard Operating Procedures. A quick sketch of marching order, for example, with standard distances thrown in.<br/><br/>A weird circumstance usually meant a quick re-sketch. For combat, descriptives were usually enough, and usually amounted to stuff like " Fred and Bill hold the flank, while Joe jumps into the ones on the right and Melfthe Elf snipes at stragglers".
