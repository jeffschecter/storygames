Surely there should be room for punk-rock stapled booklets, not just as pre-release or playtest ashcans but as the only version of a game that there will ever be. John Harper's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8706" rel="nofollow">Ghost/Echo</a> is a recent example that's been on my mind near-constantly. It stands in stark contrast to this idea that every game has to be crystal clear about its intentions and how to play it and yet, I would clearly pay $10 bucks for it, no question.<br/><br/>Basically, I'm interested in talking about ways in which folks can rock out as designer/publishers without having to commit to a 2-year production cycle and fully supporting their game for the next 5 years.  Not everybody wants that and not everybody should have to do that.  How can we lower the bar for entry while still raising the bar in other ways (like how professionally BWHQ runs their operation and produces top-notch products)?<br/><br/>There are a few different questions involved here:<br/><br/>1. How can we design games that are "complete" in a different way than 150+ page books are complete? (frex: Ghost/Echo)<br/>2. How can we distribute these games to the right audience, either through sales or for free?<br/>3. How can we support designers who want to follow a different design/production model and distribute to different audiences (i.e. not "everybody")?<br/><br/>I feel like there should be ways to destroy this idea that game design/publishing is limited to folks who are willing to make a huge commitment of time and money to it.  I bet John could playtest and publish Ghost/Echo in a few months, if that's what he wanted, and it could totally hold up as a commercial product (assuming that's what he wanted) or a free product.  I mean, hell, for a free product it's already damn good.<br/><br/>Surely we can make it easier to be a designer/publisher while still not sacrificing the quality of games.  It just may require thinking about different models of design and publishing than we're used to.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194384/#Comment_194384" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T08:34:49+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  8:34AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>urely there should be room for punk-rock stapled booklets, not just as pre-release or playtest ashcans but as the only version of a game that there will ever be.</blockquote>\nYes!!

You have to be honest about what you are producing, and you have to make the thing that you make be honest about itself.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems in indie game design is that a designer (new or experienced) looks at things like the list in the OP and thinks, "Well, I can add art and support and fantastic layout to what I've already got going, and that will make it more valuable and desirable."  This seems like a good idea; it is in fact <strong>utter bullshit</strong>.  If those things tacked on aren't true to the project, all they will ever be is tacked on, unwieldy, and make the product worse, not better.<br/><br/>The big skill here, though, is a tough one: it's understanding what the project is about.  You have to understand your project's identity before you can stop yourself from deviating from it.  And understanding design is not a common skill, it's not taught except in the loftier perches of art schools, and it's pretty hard to teach yourself.  You have to overcome your own personal biases (everything from "zombies are kewl" to "I prefer mechanically-mediated interactions in my games") and try to see the game or book or whatever clearly on its own terms and by its own merits (and faults).<br/><br/>It seems like every day I see people with their game designs or viral videos or whatever else taking one really good idea and then trying to cram it into the mould of somebody else's good idea.  They take their idea and ignore everything about the idea itself in the hopes that they'll be successful in the same way that somebody else was successful.  And that's just poison to quality and good design.<br/><br/>So at a pale attempt to be positive and helpful here, and to reiterate my first line, the best thing that we can do and that designers can do is to try to be honest before all else.  Once you have that, everything else falls into place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194477/#Comment_194477" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T11:53:14+00:00" title="February 26, 2009 11:53AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2009 11:56AM by Matt Snyder.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jonathan. <br/><br/>I'm skeptical there are practical answers to your dilemma. It's among the few key reasons I ceased to publish my games. There <i>may</i> be good answers. I'm just not seeing them.<br/><br/>EDIT: Let me clarify that a bit. I think that under the creator-owned assumption, I'm skeptical. I see more obvious answers to most of your questions. "All" you gotta do is stop being creator owned. Example: Just want to design and rock out? Don't want to support for 5 years? Get someone else to do that. BAM! Goodbye creator ownership.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to think that may be better for some people. Additionally, assembled teams (our outright enterprises/companies) answer the questions as well. <br/><br/>Again, it means not only creator-ownership probably (or often) goes away. It also means that it might create a kind of competition for designer-ship. I'm not convinced this would be a bad thing, really. That is, not bad from the perspective of better quality games.
