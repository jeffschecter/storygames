I'll probably have to start that game 5 times to get past the 5 session mark.  Not to mention the fact that I DON'T want to play 4e!<br/><br/>My In A Wicked Age group has now collapsed after 13 sessions.  This was a game where people were supposed to be coming twice a month, and I _still_ had a highly inconsistent player base, so the 13 sessions span 5 different groups of characters.  I wouldn't mind the 5 different sets of characters if we were playing for more than 2-3 sessions each.  <br/><br/>I've taught games, recruited players, helped work for my local Meetup, helped run social events to meet new gamers, expanded the player base, taught more games, and ran some kickass sessions, and six months later I'm right back where I started.<br/><br/>God damnit, I am so fucking sick of being the only person in the group that will actually put in a fucking effort for a game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172296/#Comment_172296" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T08:35:04+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  8:35AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You got some new friends that you can call up and say "Hey, let's get together and go see the Doctor Strange movie"?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so then you're not "back where you started."<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not then what went wrong?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172306/#Comment_172306" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T08:46:12+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  8:46AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            negotiating logistics has been a real issue with my gaming.  a lot of my experimental and "long tail" gaming needs have really moved over to voip/map tools/vassal where it's easier to find like-minded individuals with a block of time and similar interests.<br><br>you would think that in a city the size of New York that it would be easy to stir up face to face story game play but it hasn't worked out that way for me.<br><br>Sorry for your frustration, Ryan.

It doesn't guarantee success, but it helps a lot. I know without fail to block off my Monday nights as game night. If I'm trying to schedule something else in my life, Mondays are already out of the picture, except when it's unavoidable.<br/><br/>I've also found that gaming on week nights (especially Monday through Wednesday) is preferable to playing on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. People, especially busy adults, have a lot of demands for their time on weekends. Playing during the week tends to make the time commitment seem much less onerous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172311/#Comment_172311" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T08:54:46+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  8:54AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, remind me: where are you?<br/><br/>Perhaps try something slightly different: pitch to your friends that you are doing a Massively Long Campaign and expect it to go on for over a year, but you are playing it in Discrete Chapters of three sessions each.  Would they like in on the first chapter?  Then make sure the friends who jump in talk about said chapter in front of the friends who did not.  Make a wiki or blog or something to catalog what has happened, so it's easily accessible to players and potential players.  Then launch the second chapter.  Now, I have no idea if it would actually work, but chopping up the monolith into manageable chunks is often a good route to take.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172317/#Comment_172317" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T09:15:00+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  9:15AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Thor in that once a week is much easier than twice a month for some reason.

People want to game or they wouldn't say it to you. The few that are "just saying it" don't even show up for one session. Its just that people have a lot of demands on their time. Make it easy for them to show.<br/>\n  There are certain things you need to do to keep a group together for a long time.<br/>\n1) Weekly is the minimum frequency (bi-weekly, etc. doesn't work) you can set and still get consistent attendance.<br/>\n2) You have to ask them why they missed and share their excuse with the group. Don't be a dick about it, but be completely open. I do this every time. I usually don't comment on the quality of the excuse and if it seems like they feel bad about it I'll make a joke (like, "Dinner with your mother is more important than gaming with me" etc. to lighten the mood).<br/>\n3) Especially in the beginning, you have to be a nag, the day of the game, send an e-mail reminding them to come, call or text message them if they don't respond.<br/>\n4) Be consistent, treat everyone the same, since you are turning into an event coordinator, be fair and consistent, don't nag one person and let the other off the hook, etc.<br/>\n5) Schedule (unofficially, so people don't feel pressured) time for people to make small talk, etc. This will get people bonding and make them less likely to bail for weak, weird reasons.<br/>\n6) Be flexible, let people know you would rather have them late than not at all. But start the game on time and just let them hop in when they show up.<br/>\n  I've kept a regular weekly game running since 96, with only a few weeks a year where there was no attendance (darn family and holidays).<br/>\n  I hope this helps.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172337/#Comment_172337" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T09:57:04+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  9:57AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please let me give a caveat: I try hard to be positive most of the time, but I'm still feeling pissed off, so this is going to be negative.  <br/><br/>Tony, that's a good point.

My old group did long term (or intended to be long-term) games on Friday with systems we knew we liked (d20, In Nomine, Burning Wheel) and Mondays were 3-4 session games of other systems, whatever people felt like running (Star Wars Saga, Mutants and Masterminds, vs. Outlaws, etc.). Add in the odd weekend oneshot (Cthluhu, maybe a coiuple of sessions of GURPS) and we were all getting a good variety of games. Granted, this was a pretty dedicated group with my best friends at the core, so your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>Bi-weekly games can succeed, especially if scheduling is very clear. One of my current groups is all Microsoft employees, so everyone's using Outlook and we send out 'meeting' invites so our sessions end up on everyone's calendars.

The simple reason is that the online is not perfect by itself - it seems damn slow if you play with people whom you know and players have a tendency to vanish into thin air occasionally if you play with total strangers.<br/><br/>Back to the original post, I feel your pain, but I gotta say there're rare exceptions. I have a solo game we started as tabletop in 1999, then quickly switched to PbEM, that slowly grew into monstrous something with 35-pages long "turns" happening once a year, so we migrated into a forum PbP that also stalled once due to drastic lack of time (both me and the player were working day and night to finish out PhDs). Then we wrapped it up in two classic sessions and are now having a weekly 4-6h Skype video-session since we live a couple of thousand kms far from each other. Yes, it's slow and complicated, but we get over it and have genuine interest in keeping the story going. I'm not sure if we keep this Skype-private or go to forums once again but then weave other PCs to the plot.<br/><br/>I've always been a long games fan (the hell, I GMed a short two-session module once in my life! once! on a New Years' eve!) and frankly speaking, I have a hard time understanding folks who want series of one-timers instead of something decent. But I gotta admit, you need equally devoted, interested and fascinated players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172367/#Comment_172367" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T11:23:33+00:00" title="October  1, 2008 11:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan - that was my life between 1998-2001. I could not get a decent game for love nor money. Everything we started spluttered and failed. No-one seemed willing to put any degree of commitment into the game and when they did they were just not that interested. Sure, they talked a great game in the pub but when they got to play, it all fell apart. I was on the verge of just throwing up my hands and giving up. I didn't. I did something very different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought D&amp;D; 3e and I sent a message to all of my gaming friends that said:<br/>\n<br/>\n" Hi guys, I'm going to be running a D&amp;D; game starting in two weeks time. It will be on Monday nights, scheduled every other week. This will be an ongoing game. If you want to play in this game under those circumstances, please come along. If you cannot commit to one night every two weeks, don't want to play D&amp;D; and don't want to play an ongoing campaign, please do not come."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group that gathered are still together, seven years later. During that time we have played long D&amp;D; 3e, Buffy and Pendragon campaigns and we are currently playing 4e. It is the core of my extended gaming family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI created change in our group by sending out a strong signal of what I wanted and making it clear that I didn't want people to play unless they shared that outlook. As it happened, of the other people who didn't join our group, not one of them still roleplays or roleplayed after that day. Talking to a few of them it became apparent that we were the anchor for them to a hobby that they didn't really enjoy or want to continue. The realisation that we could still be mates and not roleplay together was like a release. Slay those gamer fallacies!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and I hope you get the games that you desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172410/#Comment_172410" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T13:31:17+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  1:31PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel your pain, Ryan.

What made it work? Well we started early evening and played late, so we had a good 5+ hours devoted to it, which meant it could handle both chat *and* focused gaming. We ate together, we had a dedicated room without distractions, and there was a lot of ceremony to settling in to play (putting out a map, sitting in favourite seats, breaking out the miniatures etc.<br/><br/>Now a lot of that is just general advice to encouraging focus (see the other threads on this at the moment), but I also think it increased commitment and helped the game last so long, because playing was a real event, not something casual. When we got there to play we knew play was going to happen, there was never a chance that it wouldn't, and that made the whole thing more solid. People really didn't miss that game very often, they put it down as a rock-solid part of their schedules and kept to it. Heck a player even moved to the other end of the country and still turned up fairly often. It took the GM moving from the UK to Canada to actually kill it.<br/><br/>So that's my advice, make the weekly session a certainty, the gaming inevitable, and people will take it more seriously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172522/#Comment_172522" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T03:01:19+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  3:01AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try being more formal about it.  Make it a specific, named club.  We did that in Milton Keynes and thus the <a>MK RPG club</a> was born.  We started with about five or six people who all agreed to meet up every Tuesday evening.  That was about five years ago.  We now get 15-20 regular players (from a town with a population of around 250,000) with normally four or five parallel games.  Create a website for the club, set up a mailing list, and advertise it everywhere you can.  People will come.  <br/><br/>We also took the view that the benefit of a club was being able to game with different systems and players.  We have a fairly fixed timetable of 8-week mini-campaigns interleaved with 3 weeks of one- or two-session games.  People propose games they're willing to run in the long blocks and everyone votes for the games they'd like to play the best.  Sometimes games span more than one long block, but not normally.  <br/><br/>If you want to know more, let me know.  <br/><br/>Neil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172614/#Comment_172614" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T09:52:59+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  9:52AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know how you feel.

Try to get the group together as often as possible for anything, gaming related or not. The most sucessful group I've ever been in was a group that were honestly my best friends. There wasn't much incentive to miss a session, because even if the game feel apart (it occasionally did) or it was a one shot, I knew I'd enjoy the company.<br/><br/>Granted, not every gaming group is going to be best buds. But consider trying to kick off a game with a character creation party. Get everybody together for whatever refreshments make sense (I'd suggest grilling something and your booze of choice, but that's just me) and let them just hang out for a while, then eventually steer the night towards discussing the upcoming game. Hopefully characters come out of it, but at the least everyone should have an idea of the game. There's also less pressure since it's not a 'gaming session' it's a party.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward" title="Scott Dorward"><img alt="Scott Dorward" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward">Scott Dorward</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172662/#Comment_172662" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T13:38:57+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  1:38PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neil speaks wisdom.  Before I joined MK-RPG I used to struggle to get a game together more than once every couple of months.  The club has pulled together a large pool of players from around the area and broken the ice between us.  Now I'm playing three weekly games and one monthly one, largely with people I've met through the club.  I've even had to turn down the option to join two more regular games, in the past fortnight, simply because I'm getting gamed out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172663/#Comment_172663" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T13:40:46+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  1:40PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't Rest Your Head is awesome for three people.
