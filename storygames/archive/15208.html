Still no roll needed.<br/><br/>I think it is Vincent's opinion from a post on freeform techniques that if you roll, the roll should allow you to do something (modify your behaviour) in ways that would not have been possible without the rolling. The roll result is giving you more information that you incorporate into the story and makes it better.<br/><br/>So.. why should we roll? how do we roll?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345635/#Comment_345635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T03:23:18+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  3:23AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2011 3:23AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>I think it is Vincent's opinion from a post on freeform techniques that if you roll, the roll should allow you to do something (modify your behaviour) in ways that would not have been possible without the rolling.</blockquote>A very narrow position to take.<br/><br/>The main reason for leaving something to <i>a moderated randomness</i> (pre-moderated by system, post-moderated by narration) is that it leaves the players/characters as leafs in the wind of fate, responding to "the cards dealt".

And that we should roll as one possible method to give up control. In freeform you often give up control by being excerpted to "give and take" in different scenes and give up control to other players, with the use of a randomizer you supposed to give up control to the randomizer.<br/><br/>I think giving up you individual control to together create something bigger that no one has complete control over is the fantastic and thrilling challenge of any kind of participant culture. No matter if we are talking about roleplaying games or dancing tango, you give up control to trust the one you share the experience with to create something greater.<br/><br/>When you give up control to a dice, you are trusting yourself and the other participants to take up the challenge create something fantastic and interesting in spite of your not in complete control.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>As a side note. I think rolling seldom introduces much "randomness". You give up control, but you give it up to something well defined<br/><br/>If you have a traditional task resolution ("You either manage to pick the lock or not") you have the possible outcomes defined. If you and the storyteller set stakes in a conflict resolution ("If you succeed the roll Marion falls for you seduction and if the failed the roll you will be interrupted by her husband storming into the room") people at the table have also defined two possible outcomes according to narrative logic. Whats pop up isn't a new alternative that wouldn't occur if dice wasn't rolled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345639/#Comment_345639" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T03:58:50+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  3:58AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I roll dice because the game provides fun options for that moment if I do, because the player has indicated that this conflict has meaning and because going to the dice is fun.

When we were little and played cowboys and local natives, the real confrontations resolved around who had the resolve and intimidation to win a contest of "I shot you / No you didn't."  By rolling the dice, we provide a mechanism of resolution in which both players can save face no matter the outcome to our avatars, thus freeing us to engage in a more varied array of conflicts which we would otherwise avoid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CorvusE" title="CorvusE"><img alt="CorvusE" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zakelro.com/images/hexaCorvus32x.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CorvusE">CorvusE</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345650/#Comment_345650" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T06:44:47+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  6:44AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Randomness encourages us to push against the boundaries of our comfort zones. It provides a constraint that can lead to moments of creative brilliance. It alters our relationship to the narrative so that we feel the uncertainty of the unknown, much as we do when reading a well crafted book or watching an exquisitely crafted movie.<br/><br/>It provides an opportunity to have the integrity to let a character go their own way and suffer the slings and arrows of misfortune, rather than protect them from every bump in the road.<br/><br/>There are any number of barriers to being an honest storyteller. Writers struggle with this without the aid of the dice, but they generally aren't sitting around a table being immediately judged for their efforts. Writers aren't usually passing control of the narrative to someone they may or may not know immediately after creating a moment. Writers have the luxury of reworking a scene and making it more honest, more powerful, more momentous.<br/><br/>But gamers, gamers have the dice and if we use them well, we will be well served by them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345652/#Comment_345652" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T07:07:31+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  7:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think rolling allows one to tell a different :"story" than intended.

I like that kind of play for some games. I also like things not turning out how intended.

I certainly experienced a similar trend in my gaming early on.<br/><br/>I'll chalk my own urge to fudge die roll results up to a sort of early instinctive understanding that sometimes die results could cause a sort of Freezing Up (of the game) or Freezing Out (of individual players) effect ( and frankly, the two often combined).<br/><br/>I think it is also interesting that you refer to that as bit as being in RPG Mode.<br/><br/>RPGs seem to regularly imply that the goal is to continue to play (open ended campaigns with no final end state desired are still the common ideal among most RPGers I've met). <br/><br/>Avoiding permanent individual loss conditions (the death of individual characters or their reduction to ineffectiveness in the case of players, the blossoming of in-setting utopian peace for GMs) is also highly valued, as it almost always impats the above mentioned greater goal of RPG mode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345678/#Comment_345678" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T11:23:30+00:00" title="October 12, 2011 11:23AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2011 11:25AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Jenskot.

Now you roll some dice: what do they say? It's a number. Does the number tell you what happens next in the story? <br/><br/>In many games, it does not. But it implies the next step in the story has a certain spin to it. I'm having an epic argument with my nemesis in court, we roll dice! It's a high number! <br/><br/>What does that tell us? Well, not too much, except: "Whatever you make up next, it should suggest that the hero is *doing well* at this point in the argument." Either the hero's arguments are powerful and effective, or maybe her opponent's are weak. Maybe some new evidence comes to light from a third party.<br/><br/>But you can't just describe the nemesis winning the argument now. Everyone would look at you like you've done something: you've just broken the rules, even if you were playing mostly "freeform" (in this context, not abiding by any predefined rules).<br/><br/>An interesting example of implementation is the game MonkeyDome:<br/><br/>The die roll doesn't determine what happens. It just determines what kind of tone you should use in your narration.<br/><br/>It doesn't need to be random, either:<br/><br/>In Fiasco, we simply choose (black die or white die).

If I, as the GM want to kill you with my orc's spear you and your warrior might have a problem with that. If I just say "you die", there's a problem. If you just say "I live", there's not necessarily enough pressure on your character. Mary Sues bat away orc spears in the dozens. <br/><br/>Dice are used to weight the distribution of outcomes, giving us both say which over time creates a situation where sometimes your desired outcome happens, sometimes mine. <br/><br/>This is as true in a standard gm'd game like D&amp;D 4e where combat and injury are the main things at stake, as in a character or world driven co-gm'd game like Shock:. In D&amp;D, the player and the DM are opposed, with other players having some ability to tilt the scales in the direction of the player. In Shock:, players take turns facing off against one another, maneuvering to find outcomes in the story that challenge the player, with death and injury being options among many that may occur. <br/><br/>The dice mediate between us. Most simply put, they take us out of the cops &amp; robbers dilemma ("I hit you!" "No, you didn't!"). We could as easily use a formal negotiation process (Polaris) or a structure that allows us to add to the fiction in sequence (Microscope), or use a "yes, and" structure like most of jeep and improv. <br/><br/>The flavor and texture that having random elements mediate can then do all of the things listed above in addition to taking us off the hook for having one person's ideas take precedence over another's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345825/#Comment_345825" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T13:06:37+00:00" title="October 13, 2011  1:06PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dice are an easy investment.
