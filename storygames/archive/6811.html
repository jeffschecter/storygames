Come on, SG folks, show the old-timers how it's done! A month and a day to go...<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="omlogo.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.otherworld.me.uk/images/shared/omlogo.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="greenlogo.png" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d164/Calithena/greenlogo.png"/><br/>\n<br/>\nare proud to announce our first joint adventure contest! Our panel of five judges includes the following RPG legends:\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n</ul>\n<b>[*]Frank Mentzer<br/>\n[*]S. John Ross<br/>\n[*]James M. Ward</b> as well as Richard Scott of Otherworld Miniatures and Ignatius \xdcmlaut, editor and publisher of <i>Fight On!</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have <b>prizes</b> available, as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>1st Prize</b> - Your choice of Otherworld's "Giant Alliance" set, with four classic giants:<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="GiantAlliance-box.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.otherworld.me.uk/images/store/giants/GiantAlliance-box.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nor the "Pig Faced Orc Tribe" boxed set, containing all 25 miniatures currently in Otherworld's Pig-Faced Orc range:<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="bs1art_t.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.otherworld.me.uk/images/store/orcs/bs1art_t.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="orcpaint4.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.otherworld.me.uk/images/gallery/orcpaint4.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>2nd Prize</b> - One Demon Idol and Two Barbed Devils:<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="idolpaint1.gif" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.otherworld.me.uk/images/store/dd/idolpaint1.gif"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="Barbed3.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.otherworld.me.uk/images/store/dd/Barbed3.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>3rd Prize</b> - An Ogre leading an Orc Patrol:<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="ogre1.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.otherworld.me.uk/images/store/dm/ogre1.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nplus seven orcs such as those pictured above. Miniatures come unpainted and (where applicable) unassembled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Honorable Mention:</b> All three winners, as well as an indeterminate number of other submissions receiving Honorable Mention, will be eventually published in an issue of <i>Fight On!</i> Not only will this get your work exposure, but you can re-submit it to other publications or sell it yourself down the road as well, because <i>Fight On!</i> only asks for the right to publish your adventure in the issue we originally publish it in in the form it is originally published in in perpetuity. <b>Ownership and all other rights remain with the authors of their adventures!</b> This policy extends to regular submissions to the magazine as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are a large number of excellent submissions, a select number of <b>First Honorable Mentions</b> will be awarded as well. A First Honorable Mention carries with it a cash prize of $10 USD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Contest Details:</b> Adventures may use any style or format and may be written for any game system, though there is some preference for systems with simpler mechanics. Adventures which are in or can be easily translated into 'old school' style fantasy game mechanics will likely receive some preference as well, though we want to see your best regardless! Longer isn't better: 2 or 3 pages with really interesting situations or locales can be much more enjoyable than a long slog! Submissions should be no more than 25 pages in any case.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, there's only one important rule: <b>your proposed adventure must contain one or more monsters or other elements available from Otherworld Miniatures!</b> Check out more of their selection on their website: <a href="http://www.otherworld.me.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.otherworld.me.uk/</a> . Figures in the 'coming soon' section are fair game as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Please send all submissions by email to iggyumlaut@gmail.com .</b> All submissions are due by midnight, July 20, 2008. Contest results will be posted as soon as possible thereafter, though if there are many submissions it may take us a while to get everything sorted out. We will try to announce winners before GenCon, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're looking forward to seeing your adventures. Happy gaming, and <i>Fight On!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151790/#Comment_151790" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T03:29:14+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  3:29AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The contest seems nice, it's just that I'm too busy with Gencon preparations to participate.
