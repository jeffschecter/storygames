<strong>Assumptions:</strong><br/><br/>Games create models of existence. Their rules define causal relationships within the imagined world. Games select only a few important ideas to include, and by doing so define the play experience. Only some facets of reality are useful, and just as important are matters psychological, social or philosophical. Every game must have both (<em>contra</em> the old idea of games being physics simulations) and, in fact, every rule probably has a social or otherwise "mushy" aspect to it.<br/><br/>With all these rules, the internal logic of the game world is created. Of course, this happens through the thinking of the players, meaning that the players' thinking is influenced by the rules of the game. If someone plays a game a great deal, perhaps it will even affect his thinking outside of role-playing. World-views might come simply from the author's own perspective, or might be inserted more purposefully into a game.<br/><br/><strong>Question of Interest:</strong><br/><br/>What unusual, interesting world-views (logic) have underlain RPGs?* Tell me about your own game(s).<br/><br/><small>* I'm interested in ideas that are incorporated into the rules — perhaps subtly — not in philosophies present in the game's setting material, even though the two may, of course, be connected.</small><br/><br/>We might need to talk about what typical world-views are, first, in order to discuss what's atypical. That's fine.<br/><br/><strong>Example:</strong><br/><br/>In D&amp;D, people are defined strongly by their material possessions, and the accumulation of possessions mirrors a person's internal evolution. Contrarily, many recent indie games have no place for possessions at all: If mentioned during play, they are temporary and serve merely as props. E.g., The Roach. We could say that this reflects a world-view that sees objects as having great or little ultimate importance.                </div>

                            Erm...if you're going to limit the discussion to only what printed rules say, you're kind of making it into a tautology or at least making the discussion really sort of short and boring. The worldview says something about the stuff the rules are about.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in the rules for both D&amp;D and the Roach, gender has no rule effect. Therefore their worldview does not encompass sexism or feminism either.  And in D&amp;D no rule says "this is a Western game about people in a dangerous wilderness surrounding benign civilization using violence to defend the innocent" even though it is.                        </div>

<i>For example, in the rules for both D&amp;D and the Roach, gender has no rule effect. Therefore their worldview does not encompass sexism or feminism either. And in D&amp;D no rule says "this is a Western game about people in a dangerous wilderness surrounding benign civilization using violence to defend the innocent" even though it is. </i><br/><br/>This is true, but Jasper still has a point.  You can strip away that "Western game about..." bit and still play with D&amp;D rules.  And, those rules, still generate the item-centric sort of worldview Jasper is talking about. <br/><br/>That isn't a tautology--it owes a lot to a model of interpretation that has had some (to my mind) nifty things to say about the way in which simple rules support (even where they do not directly determine) certain kinds of habits.  As long as we don't collapse the worldview onto the rules, reduce one to the other, this can be a very interesting discussion.<br/><br/>To take the D&amp;D example: those rules, esp. 3.5, support and assume characters will accumulate objects in order to meet the challenges set before them.  Those objects are as important as the basic character stats in their way--so, it becomes such that one of two worldviews tend to occur, both supported, but not determined, by the rules:<br/><br/>1.  Characters are just stuff, a running tally of resources with which challenges can be met.  This leads to the very fiddly, small unit wargame-iness of some D&amp;D.<br/>2.  Stuff reflects who the character is, so players spend a lot of time tailoring their items to express how they see their character, to provide them with tools that encourage them to interact with the game world in certain ways.  <br/><br/>Paying attention to the rules, rather than the color, also gives us a nifty way to think about how we can hack games, using the rules in ways other than to play out a certain sort of campaign.  It tells us something about what the rules are *capable* of doing and what they are *less* than capable of doing.<br/><br/>And, moreover, it allows us to group games around certain kinds of shared worldviews--think about the many games that, regardless of mechanical differences, basically converge with D&amp;D in terms of the 'stuff really matters' dimension.  Think, too, about how those games often just feel like D&amp;D when played, even when they are very different in terms of 'surface' mechanics.  <br/><br/>I am really curious to see what people will say about their own games...                        </div>

                            Nine Worlds should be an interesting case. The game is <i>about</i> defining your own worldview! This is encoded into the rules. That is, the rules represent your assent or dissent with worldviews. They contain basicaly no rules related to "physics" or anything like that.                        </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>I think you're misunderstanding me. I certainly don't want to restrict us to ideas the rules come out and discuss. In fact, I presume they will be silent. Rather, I'm talking about undercurrents that inform some or all of a game's rules (rules in the lumpley principle sense).<br/><br/>If some game's splat books describe a religious sect who believe in polygamy...I don't really care because it's not central to how the world responds to the PCs. I would care if the PCs are presumed to be a part of that sect and polygamy is thus a recurrent, important part of play. If it's window-dressing, it's not very interesting. That's the distinction I'm making.<br/><br/>Your D&amp;D as western example is the kind of thing I'm looking to examine. The gender issue is certainly fair game as well, though I'd rather talk about the <em>presence</em> of ideas rather than their absence, because every game has an infinitude of absences — although, an idea that is conspicuous in its absence, because we'r used to seeing it in RPGs, is certainly very interesting. I'm not sure we're used to seeing gender treated much in RPGs, so its absence from Roach is not surprising to me. Can you think of a game where sexism/feminism is important?                        </div>

                            Well, by AD&amp;D1 you have rules about women having less strength, and higher dex. Somewhat a case of "Separate but Equal," no? :-)<br/>
<br/>
The entirity of Paranioa is a very clear message about the absurdities of modern life. And most of it's sub-elements are well tailored to just that. Though in some ways it's interesting to see the early versions acting like the typical sim game. What does it mean that you have to know X skill on the tree before you know Y skill, in the skill tree edition? Does that have anything to do with the message of Paranoia?<br/>

I think that, at some point, you have to admit that many of the things in certain designs are there because they're in other RPG designs, and the statements they might make are accidental.<br/>

                            Mike (RM), I really like that the rules undermine the more obvious philosophy of the city; so you're making a point by setting up an extreme and then demolishing it (or at least questioning it). As you've playtested it, has anyone ever noticed this dimension and commented on it? Often, I think these things are quite subtle.<br><br>Other Mike, good point about gender in AD&amp;D. It occurs to me that there's a lot of thinking to be done about the alignment system there. Most obvious to me is the uniformity of morality: one good person is essentially the same as another and they are presumed to be on the same side. Different opinions about <em>what morality is</em> are ignored or dismissed as trivial. This implies a singular, universal moral system. Maybe I'm stating the obvious: killing monsters seems to rely on an easy, black and white moral code.
<blockquote>I think that, at some point, you have to admit that many of the things in certain designs are there because they're in other RPG designs, and the statements they might make are accidental.</blockquote>
Absolutely...and that's probably to their detriment. Some of these undercurrents are also not from other games, specifically, but from society more broadly. For instance, there are now several overtly Christian RPGs — with underlying ideas that are plain to see. So that's interesting to me because the philosophy of the authors is really coming through. Yet, in many cases, personal philosophy may be crushed under the momentum of past designs.<br><br>This sort of gets to the heart of the matter: can we tell who a game's author is from the game? If a Buddhist designs something, would we know it? Maybe one of the things keeping RPGs from becoming "great art" is that such personalized expression — often subtle and unconscious — is not very common (for various reasons).                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I think you're confusing the means (RPG design) with the end (RPG play), albeit maybe in an interesting way. If you want to compare to other art forms, it seems most useful to me to think of roleplaying-in-general as the medium (i.e. painting), a specific RPG design as a technique or school (i.e. action painting, surrealism), and an actual session of play as the work of art itself (i.e. Starry Night). So in this case your question might be re-framed as: "I wonder if the preponderance of certain schools and techniques is stifling personal expression when people sit down to play." To which I would answer a hearty "hell, yes". But it may be that you are aiming to say something completely different.<br><br>What your original statement suggests is that the RPG design is the work of art itself -- which makes sense if you see RPGs as things to be appreciated outside of their being played. I don't really have an opinion on that, but it seems to be something I see a lot of people arguing against fairly often, if only implicitly. It usually shows up in the context of a trend where people only buy RPG books in order to read them, which itself justifies the existence of RPGs and RPG supplements that are not meant to be used for play at all.                        </br></br></div>

I strongly disagree with the idea that setting material is mere window-dressing and irrelevant to the worldview of the game.                        </div>

                            Oh, RPG Books are pieces of art just like any other book is potentially a piece of art.  Don't Rest Your Head, for instance, looks exactly like a game of its size and pricepoint should look: a nice, tight physical presentation, clear and evocative prose, simple but subtle mechanics.  Regardless of play, the thing is a work of art.  That this piece of art can also create other pieces of art, well, that's just icing on the cake.                        </div>

                            Daniel,<br/><br/>Your re-framing of my question is spot on, and it's good you make the distinction you do. I was less than clear and my statement is predicated on the idea that the rules will strongly influence play. I also agree that some common ideas have been channeling us into ruts which are hard to get out of. Hence this thread: I'd like to identify the hidden undercurrents and also new ones we could replace them with.<br/><br/>Mike,<br/><br/>Indeed the Christian games I know are not at all subtle. Yet I suspect that even parts of the rules not stamped "Christian" are influenced by the overall design goal, and that's the same effect I'm looking for in other games. I know of at least three Christian RPGs: "Spiritual Warfare the RPG," "The Way" and another that I can't find right now. I've never read any of them, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Jason,<br/><br/>You seem to be willfully misreading me and I will admit to being frustrated. Never did I say setting was unimportant. Indeed, by a purist reading of the lumpley principle, setting is as much a part of the rules as anything else. What I said was that window-dressing type inclusion of philosophy — e.g., some random sect that exists in a world — is not what I'm talking about here. I'm interested in undercurrents that pervade the entire "game rules as world model."<br/><br/><br/>PS: I'm still interested in hearing about people's games.                        </div>

                            Jason, "window dressing" is unimportant, sure. But I'm not applying it to setting in general...just to minor set pieces. Yes, that's kind of redundant. But this shouldn't be a big issue: I just tossed out that warning so we wouldn't get side-tracked with the less pervasive ideas, which happen to be what I'm interested in. I hope that makes sense.<br/><br/>Ben, thanks so much for being constructive.<br/><br/>So that I don't become irritated with this thread, let me bring up another example I was thinking about. Technology. We think about technological development very consciously now, and views on it can really set people apart. If you look at a game what viewpoint comes across? For instance, a lot of science fiction is generally optimistic regarding our inevitable, upward progress, or at least sees advanced technology as a helpful tool. Fantasy is harder to pin down, but usually fails to incorporate the anti-industrialism of Tolkien, which I might expect.<br/><br/>Is Orkworld anti-technology? Are there games with more nuanced perspectives?                        </div>

                            Since I really do not have a gaming group anymore I need to address this in more general terms.<br/>
I am of the camp that the rules of a RPG dictate the setting. That the rules are all normally setting specific. <br/>
Yes there are generic systems, but they really tend to work well for one genre over another one.<br/>
GURPS does best for Fantasy as it came out of a Fantasy set of rules (The Fantasy Trip)<br/>
Hero System is best for Superheroes (As it came out of Champions to start with)<br/>
Fuzion really works best for SF (As it comes from 2 systems that deal well with that Cyberpunk and Hero System)<br/>
So rules dictate to a large degree what setting/genre is going to be played in.<br/>
DnD (All versions lumped together) is well suited for Heroic High Fantasy in a Medieval European Centric style setting. It works less well for Low Magic/Gritty Fantasy than its intended genre. <br/>
To me the rules certainly dictate the underlying presumptions of what is and what is not to be a part of the game and setting. <br/>
Danger, Culture, Mores, Presumptions, etc. All are explicitly or implicitly in the rules.<br/>
DnD at the heart is a Christian game. Lets face it. Dualist Beliefs (Good vs Evil) the earlier editions for critters were more overt of Angels/Devils/Demons oriented, and the intial flavor was very Dark Ages/Medievel Europe. Why the Fundamentalists whined is past me.<br/>
Later add ons mellowed it, brought in other elements, and people ported in things they wanted. All natural coures of evolution.<br/>
<br/>
My game now would be very Pagan friendly, high on the Destiny and Environmental factors, hideously strong Cyberpunk/Steampunk influences as well as magic closer to technology (in that it is all over, simple things like for communication, etc. like cell phones, computers, etc are in the modern world.) With a heavy Gothic /Victorian Look to everything because I like heavy Barouque sorts of looks, dark fabrics, dark woods, crashing ocean waves, raging thunderstorms for days, etc. That is what I like, so that is my ideal game. Morality is mutable, there is no exact right or wrong laid down in black and white and really people are the most important things at the end of the day. Those are my assumptions                        </div>

                            I do think of chess as a model of existence, albeit a strange and limited one. There is space (8x8), identity (type of piece, color of piece), and rules for movement within that space. So I disagree with the result of your first test. (Edit: I also believe that Jasper means "role-playing game" when he says "game," so I'm not sure that the Chess Test has any relevance here.)<br/><br/>How does <i>The Pool</i> not define causal relationships within the imagined world if it provides a system for players to determine all of it? I'm open-minded about your Pool test but I'm not yet convinced you're right.                        </div>

You are <b>so wrong</b>.<br/><br/>The rules of chess can, in fact, be taken as a narrative - as a way of looking at the world.<br/><br/>Fr'ex:<br/><br/>* Luck, ultimately, has no impact on success or failure.<br/>* Me v. you, or us v. them.<br/>* Individuality is unimportant - only your group affiliations (color) and occupation (piece type) have any real significance.<br/>* Some in the group are move valuable than others - it's the job of those of lesser status to protect those of importance.<br/>* Women rock the hizouse.<br/>* Complete knowledge of any conflict is essential to success.  Corollary: Deception is irrelevant or impossible.<br/>* Sacrifice is sometimes necessary for the greater good.<br/>* Conflicts are limited in scope, and working within that scope is paramount.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of narrative analysis in games - but I think it has its place, especially when you're trying to integrate theme with mechanics.                        </div>

You're making a semantic argument. It would be a lot more constructive if you tried to understand what Jasper is getting at - even if you find the words he's using as imprecise somehow - rather than simply disagreeing with the words he's using.<br/>

And yeah, generous reading with the word "model," please, even if it's not the word you would have chosen. I knew it might rub some people wrong. And substitute "Models of <b>an</b> existence," if that keeps your knee from jerking.                        </div>

                            I would have to say that a great many RPGs have a level of "violence is the only way to acheive lasting resolution of real problems" subtext going on through a combination of rules and social factors that make up the system. I mean really, how many adventures and GM advice sections have all been excercises in building up to the final climactic set-piece fight in which the villain would finally be laid low by the heroes mighty fists/guns/bolts of ass lightning? <br><br>Tied in with that is a degree of "direct personal power is the most effective way to effect change." Who needs things like social respect, a family network, and the ability to call on favors and emotional support when you can level a building with your ass lightning? And which is a better tool for a real hero, an ability to get people to work together or the ability to shoot 19 people through their left eyeball in under 3 seconds? I'll tell you which -- the shooting people, because it has a 10d6 that you paid 110 active points for. <br><br>There are, of course, notable exceptions to this -- especially in the dirty hippy camp of games -- but in many games if you don't put two in the back of Bad Dude's skull you can't expect any lasting change to happen. Unsurprising really, given the source material a lot of gaming draws on and its traditional market demographics. (So also unsurprising that it changes in dirty hippy games drawing on different sources and marketed to a different demographic. And its one of the reasons Dogs hits our particular community so hard, as it casts a really bright light on the issue in a mature way.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<del>Just pointing out: in many dirty hippie games, the situation you described would never arise, because it's not what those games are about. Or it would be resolved in ways that don't have anything to do with the tank situation. Like I can imagine running <i>Breaking The Ice</i> during the crazy days of the Tian'anmen protests and rolling to see if having one of the lovers step in front of a tank increases their Attraction. But most dirty hippie games don't have rules for "unarmed tank confronting" because their authors don't plan for those kinds of scenes to happen or, if they do, expect people to freeform them or be interested in non-tank-related things. If the tank stops, it's because somebody (or the whole group) arbitrarily decides that it does.<br><br>This is partially because the mechanical tools we've developed for roleplay games were invented to handle combat. Using them to do other things generally ends up modeling things in a way that still feels like combat, that's still based on tensions and competitiveness between the players. Even resource distribution systems are based on the anxiety that surrounds running out of resources and "losing."<br/><br/>So I totally feel ya, but I'm not sure what your real point is yet.<br/><br/>P.S. I'd totally write a game about the Tian'anmen protests or the Cultural Revolution, but I'd like to keep being allowed onto the mainland.</br></br></del><br/><br/>EDIT: I got lost and thought I was in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1753" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.                        </div>

                            That's a really good point, Brand, especially the part about personal power. I wonder if this is merely a reflection of American (Western?) culture, or is it particularly strong given some commonalities in Gamer subculture -- namely social alienation and probably a lack of physical, violent power. If you can't count on anyone, except a tight-knit group of friends maybe, you have to fend for yourself. And wouldn't it be totally cool to kill those jerks who laughed at us? (This is too harsh, but I'm not really serious. You get my point.)<br/><br/><br/>This touches on three elements of my personal list of underlying game assumptions that deserve to be thought about and questioned (copied from some notes of mine):<br/><br/>- Individualism, in which every character is a veritable island.<br/>- Main characters form a self-sufficient group, working mostly at the fringes of society.<br/>- What happens to a character is largely  within his control: he is the agent of his own destiny.                        </div>

                            There's an issue of genre political assumptions too, to summarize what I said in the politics thread: if you're running a superspy game, you best be running it with archconservative ideas of what "realistic" (read covert, undemocratic, violent) foreign policy is or you're not running it right.<br/>
<br/>
There are other parts to the spy genre - I have a great affection for Le Carre novels in which a gun is only fired once and it's a suicide - but as far as action spies go, they're right wing and hard-right-wing, much in the way Brand describes.                        </div>

                            Going further Brand, in some games, not only is there no lasting change without violence by an individual, but acting contrary to that is not just ineffective, but characterised as evil.  I remember when I first encountered D&amp;D, had the Forgotten Realms setting explained to me, sat and thought about it, and then said I felt that the individual heroes killing monsters approach to the problems facing the societies was ultimately worthless and if I were God Emperor of Everything I'd prefer to handle it as an environmental management problem.  I outlined how I'd go about it, and the response from the rest of the group was "you sound like every classic D&amp;D big villain ever!"  Nobody could identify what made the behaviour villainous, but everyone felt that it could only be done by villains.<br/><br/>Claire                        </div>

                            That's because in this kind of story, only "Villains" have big sweeping plans for social change, Claire. It's a really fascinating issue you raise; I've long reflected that in Superhero comics (a parallel genre in many ways) it's generally the villains who are proactive, and the heroes reactive. A hero generally isn't trying to "do something," he's just trying to "protect society" or "stop crime," so naturally his/her only course of action is to sit around and wait for "evil" to occur, then go out and defeat it. Heroes rarely have their own goals, drives, or dreams, except maybe "a city free of crime" or something. The Fantastic Four are a bit of an anomaly inthat they're primarily <i>explorers</i> (and thus even MORE akin to D&amp;D dungeon crawlers), so they at least go out and explor, discovering undersea kingdoms and other dimensions and having adventures in them. But who's the <i>really</i> interesting character in FF? Doctor Doom, of course, because when he's not trying to "beat Richards" or "DESTROY the Fantastic Four!" he's out to <i>make the world a better place.</i> Sure, there's the twisted methods, the hubris of thinking he knows best, yadda yadda. And that's the usual answer to why such a course is "villainous": some variation on "You have no right to make that choice for humanity," or "the ends don't justify the means." But the bottom line is, it's really only Doom who's got a genuine goal which he's passionate about and pursues. If the FF really put their money where their mouth is, there'd be free energy in every city and a Fantasticar in every home. Ditto the X-Men; they have a "dream" but it's only Magneto that actively pursues one. And Fantasy roleplaying is by and large, little different. I'd suggest, Claire, that your fellow players recognized the plan as "villainous" because villains are the only source of scial arcitecture they've ever seen.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's my rant for the day. I'm not sure if this ties in particularly well with the main points of the thread, but that last post sparked something. Obviously.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

Because a large part of the premise of the adventure was built as a stab in the face of just the structure you talk about. It's also, based on the AP reports I've gotten, a largely failed attempt (in that area, it was a success in most others) -- as the "good villains" and the "bad villains" get treated with the same fascist boot by many of the groups who play the adventure.                        </div>

                            Oh hells yes, the standard superhero-status-quo assumption. There's also a subgenre that deconstructs this assumption: Authority in comics and Aberrant in gaming.<br/>
<br/>
The D&amp;D global change belonging solely to villains story is interesting. I know the feeling the other folks were expressing although I don't agree with it.  To some degree you have to think of the standard fantasy-setting life as relatively benign, just the same with superheroes defending society - you have to portray it as being worth saving, so to speak.<br/>

I think the existence of objective evil in the standard D&amp;D setting is a part of this that people haven't quite internalized (and by people I also mean campaign designers and writers).  I see what you mean by an environmental approach, that could be a highly fruitful alternative to the 'bands of rockstar adventurers beating up bad guys' thing.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Just out of curiosity, have you seen my M&amp;M adventure Church and State?</blockquote>
No, Brand, sounds awesome. I'd love to see it. Sounds like it would definitely need player buy-in to come off OK. I have a feeling that of my current roleplaying group there would be about two people who would grok it, with maybe one borderline case. The failed AP reports strike me as the Superhero equivalent of the Knights of the Dinner Table dynamic. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>

Well, thanks for the complement, Tad, but I don't really have much more material "on hand." It's not something I've really actively thought about for years, just kind of a constant background noise in my head whenever I read or watch superhero stories. And I can't take credit for the insight; I'd cite the source if I could remember where it came from, but I read something to that effect long ago and suddenly snapped to and went, "<i>why</i> am I reading Speider-man again?"<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; I love Superhero stories. When they're good, they're great, but when they're bad, they're awful. (And I should say, the Spider-man to which I refer was the Michelinie and McFarlane era, so that's hardly a fair assessment of the ol' webhead.) I just think it's fascinating that we've turned centuries of storytelling on its head in this focus on "stop the bad guy" in place of "strive for what I desire." It's not unique to Superheroes; I mean, Sherlock Holmes is reactive. The Shadow is reactive. I guess it's the whole "crimefighter" thing, which is logical. I don't really have much insight on why things turned out this way. Just observation of the phenomenon.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>To some degree you have to think of the standard fantasy-setting life as relatively benign, just the same with superheroes defending society - you have to portray it as being worth saving, so to speak.<br/></blockquote>
You raise a good point, Jason: that "protect/save what I care about" is indeed a goal, and a worthy one. And like I said, I'm not down on Superhero stories if done well. I mean look at games like Capes and With Great Power: they tap into that rich, rich well of "and what will you sacrifice to protect/save them" and similar questions. It's just funny that all the possible stories and drives have been (mostly) narrowed down within the genre to just the one, the defensive, status-quo-preserving, bad-guy-stopping one. Is it possible to have more proactive world-changing in a superhero story? Or even just a more complex landscape of personal ambition and moral positioning? My musings on, f'rinstance, Dr Doom are hardly original; Stan himself said that the whole hook for the character was that he was a world-conqueror who honestly thought himself best for the job, and rather had a point. That's hot stuff. But in their execution, characters like Doom and Magneto end up falling as bit short because they can never be truly vindicated within the story: "when will you realize, Victor, that for all of your nobility, you're just wrong?" It's kind of the <i>illusion</i> of moral complexity. But what if we took the concept and really ran with it? What kinds of stories (non-deconstructionist ones) could be told when the lines of right and wrong are not constrained to the labels of "Hero" and "Villain"?<br/><br/>I confess I have no idea how to relate this directly to the fantasy paradigm in general and its D&amp;D iteration in particular (AKA the topic under discussion), except perhaps to say, "all that stuff up there? goes for D&amp;D fantasy too." But I'm not familiar enough, for example with the Forgotten Realms "problems" Claire mentioned to comment much on that. Actually, Claire, I'd love a synopsis of the problems and your "villain-worthy" solution to them, so that we've got something more concrete on the Fantasy side to consider (and just for my own curiosity). But I'm starting to worry that I'm derailing the thread. It's late and I can't honestly figure whether this relates to the OP's topic. Except that the Forgotten Realms <i>does</i> represent a (presumably) "interesting worldview" that has "overlain games." So there you have it.<br/><br/>Must sleep.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS Whaddya know, Tad, I guess I DID have something more to say on it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            JD, <br/><br/>Problem being that the Authority deconstructs it badly and with so much self-righteousness its hard not to gag on it. It'd be nice to see a comic that has proactive heroes who aren't Mary Sue talking heads for every form of fascist liberalism rather than the fascist conservative thats the norm in non-deconstructed heroes. <br/><br/>But hey, that's about the way it goes, right?                        </div>

                            Joel: Seems you had a word or two that is true. This so far is my fave thread on this forum besides the Japanese RPG Designs one. And for totally different reasons.<br/>
<br/>
After reading that the other day i was trying to, staying in the Superhero genre as the idea was first present to me thanks Joel, but trying to think of heros who tried to be proactive...Closest (More a Marvel fan so forgive me besides The Red Star which is the best I have read in comics since The Watchmen came out) until I typed that previous line the only hero I could come up with who seemed to the proactive side of the fence was Teh Black Panther (not going to butcher T'Challa that badly for spelling), with potentially Namor post his first appearance...But the rest are trying to save the world, or be their own person and not get picked on, etc....the others are out to make changes to the way things are....<br/>
Now to be honest this is not a concept I have much explored in my gaming, nor in my fictin writing...OUr main Champions campaign ran years, spread across 3 people running it over diff times, had some recurring heros across all of it....we did do the build a business, (did the set up caravans to make money and did the smuggler bit in DnD and Traveller in HS) so I would think my original main gaming group was somewhat focused. We did temple building, the typical save the world story lines/arcs/campaigns as well too....But back on hand since I ramble, besides The Watchmen (extreme example of trying to make some things better) and The Red Star (Fight against the corrupt system) I cannot think of heros changing the world for the better proactivly...Time to think about fantasy/SF now. More later.Tad                        </div>

                            One factor in the "preserve the status quo" thing in comics came from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics_Code_Authority" rel="nofollow">Comics Code</a>. Not depicting authority figures in a bad light was explicitly part of that code: 'Like the previous code, the CCA prohibited the presentation of "policemen, judges, government officials, and respected institutions ... in such a way as to create disrespect for established authority." But it added the requirements that "in every instance good shall triumph over evil" and discouraged "instances of law enforcement officers dying as a result of a criminal's activities."'<br/><br/>Although I note that "Females shall be drawn realistically without exaggeration of any physical qualities" was also part of the code, and that one was definitely more honoured in the breach than the observance.                        </div>

                            See, my thing with deconstructionism is, it's an essentially critical, cynical, even reactionary discipline. Not that I don't enjoy it; Watchmen, for instance, still rings my bells. And Brand's scenario, which sounds pretty deconstructionist, made me sit up and go "awesome!" But when I said "whould't it be great if. . ." what I was thinking of was a more sincere and straightforward approach: not desconstructionism (for instance, Ozymandias' famous twist on the "Bond Villain speech" in Watchmen--it's a great moment, but essentially relies on the "straight" version that it's mocking), but rather just doing it. Saying, "here's a superhero who has definite goals and pursues them," then playing that out. And though I was primarily thinking of actual comics fiction, my wording in the last sentence makes me realize this would apply well to gaming, as well. Not that a lot of gaming doesn't already DO this, but it's worth pointing out, especially in light of Claire's description of a gamer mindset essentially opposed to such play.<br/><br/>On another note, good point about the Comics Code, Mike. Comics have been an essentially straitjacketed medium for a long time; even now we're just starting to see a breakout (a mature and innovative breakout, that is--"The Ultimates," as opposed to "The Savage Dragon*.") from the superhero norms that have stood for decades. Even in the absence of the Code, I think there's still a mindset that prevails in superhero stories, though it's certainly evolved from the early Code days. Similar to the "only Villains do that" fantasy mindset that Claire encountered.<br/><br/>I didn't realize that about "Females shall be drawn realistically." Gee, where were the watchdogs on that one?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>*And if you actually like the Savage Dragon, I'm sorry. I mean, <i>really</i> sorry.                        </div>
