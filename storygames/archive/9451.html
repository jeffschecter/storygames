If you are tracking someone through the city, roughing up drunks at a bar to find out where she went, giving bribes to town guards for info, using your knowledge of local hidey-holes, etc., and you succeed, then you find your target and she has no idea you are there: You catch her by surprise.<br/><br/>By contrast, if you fail the skill challenge, you still find her, but by then she knows you are coming, has a group of thugs waiting to defend her or can set up a trap for the heroes. Either way you find her, but the skill challenge gives you an idea of whether you have the advantage or she does.<br/><br/>I think the big confusion with the "you always reach your goal" part of the skill challenge is, you arent seeing if you reach your goal, you are seeing under what circumstances you reach your goal.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210479/#Comment_210479" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T07:41:23+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  7:41AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Then the goal is the the degree, not the success.

We're discussing the topic of the blog post which is the OP of the thread.</p>\n<p><strong><em>"The idea is not to haver those situations where a failure stops the game dead."</em></strong></p>\n<p>I'm agreeing with this.  100%.  What I'm not agreeing with is the idea of saying that the goal is one thing then resolving it as something else.  It's not semantics.  It's the difference between being up front with your players about what's going to happen as a result of failure or pretending that the goal of the challenge is something that it's not.</p>\n<p><strong><em>"...that is how the game designers have explained it was intended."</em></strong></p>\n<p>It may very well be that the designers intended <em>success with consequences</em> as a possible result from a skill challenge failure.  After reading your last post, Michael, I went back to the DMG to see if I read something wrong and found their example "Urban Chase" on pg 78.  I'm dissapointed, but not surprised, at the lame example.  I'll accept that I was wrong in my implication that the success with consequences type failure was a modification to the rules.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the other examples in the DMG clearly show that the designers also intended skill challenges to occationally result in total failure.  Therefore, saying that skill challenge failures should <em>always</em> result in success is certainly a deviation from the game as-written.</p>\n<p>However, I still stand by my position that a skill challenge goal that must succeed or cannot succeed is a lame goal, and not one that I want as part of my gaming experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210517/#Comment_210517" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T10:21:32+00:00" title="June  5, 2009 10:21AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I can understand your position. I heard interviews with the designers before I went to read the books, so I went in with a different perspective when it came to skill challenges. That doesn't mean I don't see where you are coming from. It is an issue for you, but not for me, and that happens.<br/><br/>I do enjoy the idea of a failure becoming part of a story. I think there was an example posted on here a while back about a Mouse Guard game where the players were in danger of not completing a mission to redirect a swelling river before it flooded out a nearby village. A lot of people argued the game would be just as cool if they failed to stop the river, because then it would become "How do you deal with your failure?" and the characters trying to rescue what people they can and minimize the damage/loss of life. And that is pretty cool.<br/><br/>I think the DM needs to be very upfront about what the skill challenge is about, and I don't think the DMG does a good job of spelling that out. I still think skill challenges are one of the potentially coolest yet most confusing aspects of 4E.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210520/#Comment_210520" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T10:25:38+00:00" title="June  5, 2009 10:25AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>***I still think skill challenges are one of the potentially coolest yet most confusing aspects of 4E." ***</p>\n<p>I certainly agree with you there.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210525/#Comment_210525" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T10:30:09+00:00" title="June  5, 2009 10:30AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My recent Metrocalypse AP report discusses <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=210173" rel="nofollow">a skill challenge</a> whose outcome didn't really matter.

That is the goal for everyone GM and players not GM vs. players.  The goal is the thing that will push the story forward.  I don't realy view SCs as conflicts where there are two sides working at cross purposes but as a way for players to challange themselves with the GMs help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
