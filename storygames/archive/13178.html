So!  Someone recommend me a webcam for a Windows XP machine, and maybe we can play together on Infrno.<br/><br/>Also, my headphone/mike combo recently crapped out, so will need a replacement there too.  I've heard USB mike/headphones are best? Work with me here, make me a recommendation, there are Skype games too.<br/><br/>Also post your own computer hardware (or software, whatevs) questions related to playing (or creating, whatever) story games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296807/#Comment_296807" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T01:25:00+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  1:25AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't really comment on a good webcam, but the one I used to have was made by Creative and it didn't last too long.<br/><br/>I'm on a Mac these days, just a little 'Mac Mini' as I'm not rich, and I use Adobe CS5 for pretty much everything except word processing, for which I use Open Office. I have tried numerous freebie programs to replicate the same features (Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus) but none of them really come close to what can be achieved with the expensive software. Of those three I mentioned, GIMP is probably the best of the bunch and Scribus the worst.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296830/#Comment_296830" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T07:34:36+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  7:34AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a free piece of software that will do what After Effects does in terms of motion graphics?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
