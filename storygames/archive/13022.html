The idea was to release free gaming content on a semi-regular schedule and use that as the foundation to build a game or create a modest revenue stream or something, sort of like Webcomic creators have done.<br/><br/>So I decided to do exactly that, and I thought it would be a good idea to share my results. My blog is called <a href="http://blog.microdungeons.com/" rel="nofollow">Year of the Dungeon</a>, and I\u2019ve been putting out three small dungeon, town, or wilderness maps every week this year. Here\u2019s a little report on my results.<br/><br/>The main goal with Year of the Dungeon was to spark creativity and get out of the mental rut I found myself in after Gen Con 2009. Creatively, Year of the Dungeon has been a spectacular font of energy, ideas, and synergy. Having some small involvement in creating on a regular schedule keeps me focused and primed to keep creating. Sometimes it\u2019s a grind to make something worthwhile for the blog, but sometimes a deadline is just what you need to develop some idea that might have just drifted away otherwise. And the other people who have clicked with the project, commented, contributed, and basically sent love my way has been really amazing. The feedback from people who have read, used, enjoyed, and otherwise gotten pleasure out of my artwork has repaid my investment 100 times over!<br/><br/>The secondary goal was financial. Game design and art are a small but important sideline business for me, so it\u2019s important that my projects show the ability to produce at least a small return on investment of time and money. Financially, Year of the Dungeon has produced little return. I\u2019ve sold a few bits of original artwork and probably some copies of my game were sold to people who were reading my blog. <br/><br/>The surprise in making Year of the Dungeon was in the intangible results\u2014the things I didn\u2019t take into account when I kicked this thing off. First off, I now have over 100 pieces of artwork that I can draw upon for inspiration any time I need them. As an indirect result of the blog, I now have one and possibly two art shows scheduled (an idea that was completely off my radar a year ago). I\u2019ve got a rough draft of a sequel to my current game, and I\u2019ve helped create another game, partially thanks to the blog. I\u2019ve put dungeon art in the hands of a bunch of people who\u2019ve never played D&amp;D in their lives. And I\u2019ve connected with a bunch of awesome people who have offered help, encouragement, and advice.<br/><br/>The most important thing I learned is that the so-called Webcomic model isn\u2019t a recipe for business, but it can be an engine of creativity and community. When I tried to find ways to \u201cmake money\u201d off my blog, I always failed and my efforts probably made the blog worse. I spent a couple months trying to figure out how to bolt on an online store onto my blog where it was not needed. When my mantra was \u201cmake something awesome,\u201d I found untapped reserves of love and inspiration I never expected to find and things went better.<br/><br/>I\u2019m convinced that there\u2019s spectacular potential in this model for game designers, artists, and writers. Here are the things I\u2019ve learned over the last then months, in a nutshell:\n<ol><li>Build up a reserve of content ahead of time! Start creating at least 1 month before you go live. No, make it two months. You will sputter out and die if you don\u2019t.</li>\n<li>Make something you think is cool and awesome.</li>\n<li>But don\u2019t worry too much about quality. Get your shit out there and refine the best stuff later.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t overload your blog with other goals, like making money or publishing a book.</li>\n<li>But if you see an opportunity to leverage what you\u2019re doing on the blog into your other goals, go for it! </li>\n<li>Quickly spin off promising related projects and make them their own thing so your focus on the blog doesn\u2019t get muddied. This is what successful entrepreneurs do, and you should do it too.</li>\n<li>If you\u2019ve got the time, skills, or money, invest in a good design for your site. I don\u2019t do this, and I always regret it.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t let your blog sputter out, but do take defined breaks when you need them. Don\u2019t be afraid to end the project when you\u2019re done.</li></ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Sheridan" title="Matt Sheridan"><img alt="Matt Sheridan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img358.imageshack.us/img358/1651/gear9ok.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Sheridan">Matt Sheridan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293650/#Comment_293650" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T14:33:39+00:00" title="September 16, 2010  2:33PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2010 2:33PM by Matt Sheridan.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh oh.  Your links are as malformed as your maps are awesome.  They've ended up with extra slashes and quotes, somehow.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've got a few thoughts on the webcomic model, as I've been privileged to see the gradual success of a webcomic from behind the scenes.  And the most important point might just be that "gradual" part.  You can expect a webcomic to have to run for about three years before you start seeing any real profit out of it (and even then, of course, nothing is guaranteed).  Amassing an audience takes time, and the audience is the first and hardest step to success.<br/><br/>Once you've got a good audience (which can mean either a very large one <i>or</i> a very dedicated one), there are more ways to make money off of a comic--or any Web endeavor, really--than are really worth discussing, here.  There's a saying in the webcomic community that creating a successful comic is like making bear soup: The soup recipe is really quite simple, but first <i>you have to kill a bear</i>.<br/><br/>...All of which is a rambling way to say that you shouldn't necessarily count out financial returns yet.  Obviously, gamers are a smaller slice of humanity than people who read comics on their computer, so I can't say for certain that the truisms of the still-fetal webcomics business really apply to RPG projects using a webcomic-like model, but I do believe that, fast as the Internet is, gathering a following is a slow, slow process that pays off nicely down the line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293652/#Comment_293652" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T14:53:14+00:00" title="September 16, 2010  2:53PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great to hear -- good to hear of your experiences at all, and good to hear that they've been positive.<br/><br/>When I just show up on your page... it's not as easy or as obvious to me as it could be that some of these are for sale.
