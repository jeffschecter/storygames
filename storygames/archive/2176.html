                    I've been thinking about tracking conflict arcs as they sporadically combust their way through a given piece of fiction.  Star Wars has lots of really clear examples, so ... "Luke wants to become a hero."  I've posited <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/2145/need-a-term-buffers-to-conflict-immediacy/#Item_60" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a> that the process by which these conflicts progress is by stripping away the complicating little details that surround early conflicts, and eventually getting to the final, true conflict.<br/>
<br/>
Like, the first conflict of Luke's heroism is complicated by Vader, and his friends, and spaceships, and the death star, and what he thinks he <i>knows</i> and ... lots of stuff.  His first great success is to remove "what he thinks he knows" from his way of dealing with conflicts ... 'Let go your conscious self, and act on instinct.'<br/>
<br/>
By the end of <i>Return</i>, however, all of those complications have been stripped away.  Vader is no longer the enemy, his friends cannot help him, there are no spaceships or death stars or all that between him and the fundamental choice.<br/>
<br/>
Now the stipped down conflict would be <b>wholly uninteresting</b> before the process of stripping.  If the Emperor dropped in on whiny-farm-boy Luke at the start of the first movie and Luke dropped his ... what ... garden hoe? ... and said "No.  You failed.  I am a Jedi, like my father before me," we'd say two things.  "Who the hell is this wrinkled guy, and why do we care?" and also "That Luke kid has not earned the right to have that much impact from that small a decision."<br/>
<br/>
Well, lots of talking to get down to the final question:  I'm thinking of making a system where you need to roll dice for all of the steps leading up to that final, true, most-fundamental confrontation, but then letting the players do (and achieve) <b>anything they want</b> if they can manage to reach that summit.  Like, Luke rolls dice to blow up the death star, and rolls dice to fight Vader, and rolls dice in the forest of Endor ... but then if he can manage to get past all the complications, get down to the very heart of his characters conflict, there are no more dice.  I just say "Okay ... the Emperor is goading you to kill Vader.  This is your moment.  What is Luke's destiny, now, at the end?"<br/>
<br/>
If you were playing Luke would you feel cheated by that?  If you were playing Han, watching, would you feel cheated by that?                </div>

                            If I'm playing Han and Luke is having his moment, but as Han I'm still 29 dice away from my moment and then Luke's moment takes away from something that I'm anticipating for my moment, I'd feel a little cheated. On the other hand, if Luke's destiny and my destiny are separate enough that Luke's final moment will have no direct reflection on mine, then no sweat. Or if we face our moments at the same time and share in making it happen, like Han, at the same time, taking the shield down as Luke fights Vadar, then cool. And our buddy Lando flies my ship that the weasel borrowed into the Death Star at the same time for his moment, then cool.                        </div>

                            This is really helping me grapple with some design issues I'm having with Growing Pains.

That <i>doesn't</i> mean victory.  That means what the player decides ... which will clearly be influenced by the events that have occurred in getting their character to that point.  Yeah, I'm thinking about the end of the <i>Spiderman</i> movie here.  Getting to the point where you address the conflict in its rawest, purest form doesn't mean that you automatically get what you were trying for.  It means that you show what you're made of.<br><br>And that's, honestly, why I think that leaving <i>that last conflict</i> subject to the dice is different from subjecting any earlier conflict to the same randomness.  When there are complications ... buffers between the raw issue and its resolution <i>this time</i>, I can say "Well, yeah, the dice are telling him that he doesn't tell Mary Jane that he loves her, but that could be because of the sudden interruption by muggers, or this that or the other thing."  When you're out of complications, there's no getting around the fact that the decision defines the character.                        </br></br></div>

                            I want to bring out an aspect of your theory of narrative that's important in answering the question you're asking.  You suggest that what's going on is a "stripping away" of complications to get to the "one true conflict"--but you rightly say that it doesn't make any sense to charge right into the "one true conflict," because it wouldn't make any sense for the protagonist to confront that final conflict without having first passed through those intermediate steps.<br><br>So isn't it more correct to say that the "one true conflict" isn't some pre-existing end-point, but something that emerges from that process of stripping away complications?  Because the protagonist at the beginning of the story is a cipher.  Through narrative action (play), he or she gains attributes/properties/characteristics -- we see him or her become defined as impulsive or disciplined, brave or clever, compassionate or vengeful.  And in most cases the antagonist takes on some kind of contrary or opposing attribute (Luke is kind to droids, Vader is cruel to everybody).  And the logic of narrative is such that it is the character who displays the attribute more valued by author or audience that ultimately gains the title "hero" regardless of his or her ultimate success.<br><br>But notice what most narrative action is doing:  it's defining a character in a particular way, assigning to him or her an attribute that literally characterizes him or her.  In the classic form of the heroic tale, the hero undergoes a test that reveals his or her heroic qualities (a "qualifying test") before meeting the main challenge he or she faces.  Some heroes even face a "glorifying test" after their main test--e.g., having slain the dragon, can the hero forestall efforts by false heroes the claim the credit?  Having come back to Ithaca, can Odysseus answer Penelope's riddle about his bedpost?  In each case, though, the issue is:  Is the hero brave enough, clever enough, wise enough, virtuous enough, lucky enough, <i>something</i> enough to be the hero?  Not only do we not know this at the beginning of the tale, we don't even know what that <i>something</i> is until it's revealed in action.<br><br>You're with me on all this, right?  You agree that the complications aren't important in themselves, don't you, and that the obstacles only exist to let the character show us what he's made of?  Once we know who the character is, we can decide (as author, as audience) if the hero is heroic enough, when facing some defining "final" challenge, to meet the test and pass it (even if "passing" means only to die without betraying his or her principles).  And it may be that the "hero" <i>isn't</i> heroic enough:  he or she fails the test, succumbs to the opposition, or betrays what he or she stands for.  Think Winston Smith in <i>1984</i>.<br/><br/>So much is pretty basic.  The answer to your question, I think, lies in the notion that multiple protagonistic viewpoints can reflect or comment upon each other more or less ironically, so that one character's arc can often be taken as a "counter-argument" (or complement) to another's.  I first noticed this in Kim Stanley Robinson's <i>Red Mars</i>, where John Boone and Frank Chalmers stand in this kind of relation:  idealistic dreamer vs. savvy politico--which one is more effectual in bringing about their vision of Mars?  Han and Luke have this kind of relationship as well, but it's less strongly drawn after the first movie, the whole point of which is that Han comes around to Luke's mode of heroism ("I always knew there was more to you than money!")<br/><br/>So the way to make one character's "final conflict" relevant to other characters (and thus hopefully interesting to other players) is to have that conflict center on exactly those points of differentiation that form the contrast between the characters, and to make those points of differentiation consequential in the outcome of the final conflict, in some way.  "All right, in Luke's final conflict we established that a son's love can turn a father from evil to good.  What do you want to go with, Han?  How about 'Can a son's hate turn his father from good to evil?'  Nah, too formulaic, and you don't have any kids yet.  I know!  You were once a criminal, so how about  'Once you've been on the dark side, can you ever really come back?'"<br/><br/>I'm not sure mechanically how that would be implemented, but I know that if my "score" depended on how well my arc inverted the meaning, thrust, or significance of yours, I'd be paying attention.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Well, that's a meaningless question in terms of a finished story (like a novel), right?  The finished work exists as a unit, and is only <i>perceived</i> as unfolding in time.  Luke does not <i>become</i> the character who can destroy the Death Star, he is that character from the start because the whole damn movie's been filmed.<br/><br/>So to some extent, I'm doing a cheesy little trick when I use Luke's story, and refer specifically to the bits that support the story-arc that I know (having watched the movies) will turn out to be his important arc.  I don't talk about Han and Luke vying for Leia's attention, because I can cherry-pick from foreknowledge.<br/><br/>Whether you have that foreknowledge in an RPG is a rules choice:  If you were playing a certain kind of RPG, those scenes might sway the tide in what sort of final conflict you actually have.  You might decide to make it a story of a star-crossed romantic triangle, with all of the stuff about the Empire adding pressure and symbolism to that.  And then, when <b>that</b> story is finished, you'd again (with the foreknowledge now in place, as you speak in retrospect) be able to pick out the things that were attached to the big conflict.<br/><br/>But in <b>another</b> type of RPG you actually start out with that foreknowledge.  If you're playing <i>PTA</i> then you know that "Heroism" is Luke's issue and "Romance" is not.  I've been thinking about these issues from that point of view, with foreknowledge of what the core conflict is, but I'd be interested in hearing how people think the same techniques could be used in a game where the arcs are built without foreknowledge.

I really don't think that applies to my question at all.  I'm not looking to weave peoples stories together that way.  I know it can be done, but I don't think it's a tool I need for this job.  Do you have some compelling reason that I <i>should be</i> worried about it?                        </div>

Your idea has me nodding. Yes, I can see that working. In fact, I <i>have</i> seen that.<br/>
<br/>
My group and I just finished a season of PrimeTime Adventures where this came up several times. We'd build up to a protagonist's spotlight episode, honing in on its Issue -- and in the climactic scene where the protagonist really faces the issue head-on and makes an all-or-nothing choice, we just could not get ourselves to play any cards.<br/>
<br/>
One example was the young mutant (it was an X-Men show) whose issue was "learn the truth about his parents." He'd been left on the steps of an orphanage as a baby, and he wanted to know where he came from, and why he'd been abandoned, and all the stuff tied up with that. In his spotlight episode, he ended up facing his biological father, a Morlock, who had kidnapped Professor X for a revenge plot. He faced the choice to join with his birth father, or help Professor X, his father-figure. The stakes were obvious -- but how could we use cards to decide them?<br/>
<br/>
The last thing we wanted was a random element making the protagonist's statement "for" him, so to speak.                        </div>

                            PTA-wise, my understanding is, if nobody calls for a conflict, nobody plays any cards. So if everyone at the table is happy with the player's decision about the character, then the scene is played out without any card-conflict. Cards are used when you want to resolve uncertainty or curiosity, if you are not curious "how things might go" if the cards come up another way, you just keep playing the scene.<br/>

                            Tony: there's a danger here of "climax creep," though, isn't there?  If the player has earned lots of freedom to narrate the climax of the story, that just means that the climax of the <i>game</i>, where the player earns those rights, comes earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, as a practical matter, this happens all the time in traditional games, and kinda happens with Transcendence in Shadow of Yesterday.  But it just means that the outcome of that character's story isn't where the excitement is.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I really like Vincent's blog post where he talks about using dice to figure out which Bruce Willis movie you're in.  If you strip random chance out of the outcome, there's less suspense.  Obviously YMMV.<br/>
<br/>
EDITED TO ADD: Often when someone has a strange idea on the Net, I sometimes react negatively.  I'm not doing that here: I'd be really interested in seeing what you come up with.  But that's my un-enlightened take on it.                        </div>

I think I agree with you (and Tony) - because, Frodo never dices to see if the ring goes into Mount Doom, Luke never dices to see if he redeems Vader. Fate has been replaced by destiny.<br><br>But, in game terms is that as exciting as having the ending in doubt? I mean, if you had a final conflict, the outcome might still be the same, but the way it comes about might be different if you win or lose ... I'm not sure, I can see both sides of the argument, and I'm still not sure which way I'm leaning.                        </br></br></div>

                            I think things are a little different.<br/>
<br/>
Luke's final conflict with the Emperor is the same conflict that runs through the entire narrative (or indeed any narrative) dark vs light (Star Wars makes it even more obvious by literally having a dark and light "side") . Luke is still a light character so he does the right thing - which enables the redemption of Vader. Athough Vader has done too much dark shit to be saved, he can be redeemed in this final act.<br/>
<br/>
So I think the question is how you handle the dark/light conflict for players - let them choose or have some sort of dark/light mechanic.<br/>
<br/>

                            The way most indie games handle this issue is to give the player some sort of resource that they can call upon to win when they really want to (fan mail in PTA, re-rolls in trollbabe, sincerity/intimacy/desperation dice in MLwM, etc.). With these systems, the player has a certain amount of influence over rolls when they want it. Also, different systems grant different amount of narration rights in regard to the interpretation of rolls. When you tie these together, resolution-influencing mechanics and broad narration rights, the player can effectively dictate what they want in a given scene.<br><br>So, what I'm saying is that the effect you're suggesting, Tony, is already present in many games. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try something different, though. But I do see one advantage to a unified resolution system---sometimes a pivotal moment comes in the middle of the game. Sometimes, that pivotal moment is more significant than the "final" conflict. And sometimes you'll have a few pivotal moments. A unified resolution allows the player to influence those scenes they deem important, not just the "final" conflict.                        </br></br></div>

                            I take your question to be, "Is it anticlimactic or unfair to just let the player say what happens when his or her character reaches the 'final conflict'?" And I think that it's not anticlimactic only once you recognize that the purpose of all those intermediate tests (conflicts) in the narrative is to give the character (or more precisely, let us see in the character) the attributes he or she needs for the final one.  In that case, the point of "leading up" play is show us that the character either has or doesn't have the particular attributes that are of interest.<br><br>At the end, the character will either bring a track record of preliminary success or failure to the final conflict, and the player will choose for the character to ultimately succeed or fail in that conflict.  One way that a player is motivated not to choose to always succeed is if ultimate failure is thematically interesting:<br><br>Preliminary Success + Ultimate Success = Glorification Tale (Hagiography)<br>Preliminary Success + Ultimate Failure = Tale of Hubris<br>Preliminary Failure + Ultimate Success = Redemption Tale<br>Preliminary Failure + Ultimate Failure = Cautionary Tale<br><br>The point of giving a player the power to unilaterally determine success or failure in the final conflict has to be to allow him or her to shape the structure of the character's story in a way that "addresses premise" or lets the player say something meaningful. <br><br>But that powerful message that emerges from the player's choice for the character shouldn't be allowed to hang out in the vacuum, a closed-off, incontrovertible statement.  To the extent that the choices of other players can be seen as commenting on, responding to, or addressing the first player's choice, you have a conversation.<br><br>Now, to some degree this will happen automatically. But it's only fair, if you're going to design in moments where one player gets to make powerful statements about the world, that other players be explicitly allowed to respond to those statements.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Okay, I'm willing to stand corrected.  My larger point still holds, though: such a structuring is desirable (something a player might shoot for, i.e.) when it helps make a thematic statement that someone is wittingly committing to.                        </div>

                            Okay folks, you bring up very good, very solid points.<br/>
<br/>
James:  Climax creep (or, rather, ending the game in a way that is not <i>of</i> the game in any important respect) is a definite problem.<br/>
<br/>
Bill:  The non-random result does have a lot more appeal if it is referred up to the player-level in some way that is more interesting and consequential than just "Decide what you think happens, then forget about it."<br/>
<br/>
While you've been making all those solid points, someone who wishes to remain anonymous (I know!  I asked!) whispered me to point out the similarities to Greg Stolze's <i>In Spaaace....</i>, in which conflicts defeated become power for later.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'd already been thinking about this in terms of conflicts, but this helpful person pointed out what I'd blinded myself to:  That the right way to apply it is, rather, to complications.  Getting to the core of one conflict <i>might</i> give you some ability to influence a different conflict, but how you peel away the complications of a conflict should <b>certainly</b> have an effect on how much control you have in terms of its ending.<br/>
<br/>
Now remember, the question of who peels away complications is <i>independent</i> of who wins the sub-conflict in which they are peeled away.  You can win a sub-conflict and win rights to peel away a complication, or win the sub-conflict but have somebody else say how it changes the complications.  Likewise, you can lose a sub-conflict and have someone else say how it changes the complications, or you can lose the sub-conflict but win the rights to peel away a complication.<br/>
<br/>
In fiction terms, for instance, you can win the student presidency with the help of your friends, but then peel them away from your Pride conflict not because you don't need their help any more but because your underhanded tactics pissed them off so more that they abandon you to your (empty?) triumph.<br/>
<br/>
Given that, I'm inclined to reply to all the excellent points raised by proposing that each complication peeled away becomes a vote in how the core conflict is eventually decided ... possibly as straightforward as that, no randomness, just people revealing their intentions at the final moment, and the side with the most votes getting their result.<br/>
<br/>
This provides the possibility of a scenario I am deeply vested in having in the game:  The person who flees their destiny out of fear of what another thinks of them, but when they are forced to it finds that their fears are far from being justified.  Miyazawa running from Arima in the second episode of <i>Kare Kano</i> ... or, for the less anime-inclined, Emma fleeing from Knightley because she fears that now, when both of their defenses have been stripped away, what he will tell her is that he loves another.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it even works with <i>Star Wars</i>!  If Luke has five votes, and the GM (representing harsh fate, the Empire and the Emporer) has six votes but <i>Vader</i> has four then Luke might well fear putting his heroism to the final test when Vader is still (seemingly) loyal to the Emporer.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I <i>could</i> add some randomness ... like people have to roll dice in order to get their votes, but ... I'm not sure it's needed.  I like the stark simplicity of saying "You know exactly how the votes are distributed if you bring this to climax.  Now you have to choose whether to try to push it that far."<br/>

If you say, "I'm going to go and try to stop the Scourge" after only one quest, you can't succeed, at least not with stopping them as your goal.<br><br>I think it's more structured, or paced, than what you're doing, but similar I say! Similar!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Tony: Sorry for coming late to the party, but at the end of my 18-month long Post-Roman Britain campaign, we got the Battle of Badon Hill. I gave the players two options: use the system to determine the outcome of the battle or just agree on what happens. They took the latter choice, and at least for me, it wasn't at all anti-climactic. People died, stories were concluded, and everything worked out the way it seemed it should. I did ask for some concessions ("Come on, you're ending the Saxon threat forever, and nobody important dies?"), but by that point in the game, everyone had a very good idea of where their character should end up.<br><br>--Paul                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Harald:  I dunno.  Is it supposed to be different?</blockquote>
Damn me and my ways to just write in avery condensed style...<br><br>I think the transcendence rules in shadow of yesterday provide what you are looking for. I probably summarise something you know well enough: When a character reaches the highest level in an ability and then uses that ability to maximum effect (rolls the best result available), this character transcends. The player is free to describe the outcome of the current conflict, as this is the peak of the character's career/the culmination of her story arc. The day belongs to that character, who will be retired as a play-piece afterwards. It does not necessarily mean the character ascends to godhood or dies in a slaughterfest of epic proportions. It may also be that nobody knows what came of them, or they took sails to cross the eastern seas....<br><br>The whole process is very much in the hands of the player, as there are ways to avoid rolling too good results. So, you have the normal rules for the farm-boy to knight-in-shimmering-armor story, and when the player deems her character ready for the final, decisive conflict (striking down the evil overlord for good), she will succeed.<br><br>I think this is a great way to handle the timing for the 'ending' of a heroic character. I would clearly love this mechanic being the player of both Luke and Han. Han is only watching and not transcending because his player has more fun playing him some more than transcending him right then.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Cool discussion, Tony! I'm working with similar issues in my game Mathematica, and I think we have some issues in common. I'm basing my game on the TSOY system, so transcendence plays a role in all this. I apologize if I misuse theory terms.<br><br>Transcendence hands narrative control to one player for a brief period. The "price" he pays for this is not being able to play that character anymore. This makes it a natural choice to transcend when your character's story arc is over. Any time before that and you're missing out on the bulk of the cool things your character might do.<br><br>The questions you have to ask are:<br>- What's the barrier to narrative control?<br>- When and how does a player get narrative control?<br>- What are we fighting over?<br>- What is the scope of their narrative control?<br><br>Here's how TSOY answers them:<br/><br/>Whatâ€™s the barrier to narrative control?<br/>In TSOY, players transcend by driving up an ability high enough to roll a transcendent success. Ability level is a sort of clock between the player and transcendence, but it's one that the player has a lot of control over. The clock is pushed by spending advances, and advances are gained by pushing story (through keys). A player can advance the clock all the way to transcendence in a session or two with a little work. By contrast, Burning Empires has a clock that's hard to push, and the GM pushes back!<br/><br/>When and how does a player work towards narrative control?<br/>By rolling the dice. An interesting effect of this is that transcendence only ever happens inside of a conflict. A good question to ask here is how winning or losing a conflict impacts the answer to the ultimate conflict. In Burning Empires, it has only an indirect effect at best. The players can do everything right and make amazing rolls and still suffer a major setback in the greater action.<br/><br/>What are we fighting over?<br/>What is at stake in the larger action? In TSOY it's whatever the player wants to be at stake. The transcendence narrative isn't pegged to a particular goal. If PTA had transcendence, it might be built around resolving character's issue. In Burning Empires, it's who wins the war. <br/><br/>What is the scope of the narrative control?<br/>If I understand you correctly, your idea is that the character is resolving their story arc. The sub-questions here are what MUST change, what CAN change, and what CANT change as a result of the narration. In TSOY, IIRC, the player has very wide control over their narration. In Mathematica, players compete to narrate the actual fate of a person, place, or thing in the story. They are limited in narrating how this fate impacts other things that are also up for narration. In Burning Empires, players get fairly limited narrative control over how they narrate the final result of the infection. In TSOY, if you want to change something in the game world, you transcend. In Burning Empires, your character probably has to go over there and change it themselves in the course of play.<br/><br/>Capes is another game that can provide some ideas here. In capes, questions to be resolved are written on cue cards where the can accrue resources on either side of the question (actually, I barely understand how Capes works, even after I've played it). This is a great approach, because it puts the "big issues" out there for all to see. The answer to question 2 then becomes "How do we put resources on this question?"<br/><br/>In Mathematica, big questions go on cue cards and dice from in-game conflicts go to these cards after the conflict. So in this case, each character conflict is also a conflict over who gets to advance the clock on a big question and in what direction.<br/><br/>So to summarize, weâ€™ve got:<br/>- a clock that ticks down towards the final narration<br/>- a possible relationship between what the characters do in play and the final resolution<br/>- whatâ€™s decided in the conclusion<br/>- how much latitude the player has to narrate the details of that resolution<br/><br/>I realize my verbiage isn't entirely clear, but I hope it helps.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Okay, folks, I do know the TSOY rules, but I'm pretty sure they're not the <i>only</i> way to approach this.  Don't get carried away with the Star Wars references.  Star Wars has big, obvious arcs of conflict, and (<i>coincidentally</i>, as far as I'm concerned) only has one per character throughout the course of the movies.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kare Kano</i>, by contrast, has subtle but powerful arcs of conflict ... and has each character go through more than I can easily track in the course of the whole story.<br/>
<br/>
Isn't the same mechanic, of stripping away the trivialities of a conflict in order to get down to the core of it, in effect in both places?  Does getting to <b>a</b> core conflict that totally redefines the character mean that they shouldn't immediately be thrown into their <i>next</i> core conflict (that will, in time, completely redefine them again)?  People having only one story and living Happily Ever After at the end of it is fine if you're <i>aiming</i> for a fairy tale structure, but is there some reason it should be essential?                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  Tony, I want to re-state an important point someone else made in a different way.<br/>
  Let's look at it this way, during each of the rising sub-conflicts, the player has a choice, enjoy the journey or enjoy the destination. I think that you should build a mechanic that rewards both preferences. Meaning, specifically, that every time one of these rising sub-conflicts needs to be resolved, the question for the player should be: Is the journey more interesting, or the destination? Or, do they gain some sort of cookie that only works RIGHT NOW for picking the journey or instead do they get a cookie that can only be used at the end of their story arc for picking the destination?<br/>
  It's a classic win-win scenario that I feel leads to more interesting gameplay.<br/>
  What do you think?<br/>

                            Dave,<br/><br/>Yeah, that could lead to some interesting game play. You could also this into a situation where players might have to make a choice over which one they care more about, their principles (big conflict) or what's happening right now.                        </div>
