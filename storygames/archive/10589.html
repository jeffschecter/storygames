I can start a new thread, but I have nothing to contribute - I'm interested in the outlines of a postmodernist game, even as a thought experiment, if it encompasses new ways of approaching the fiction or social experience.  If you've thought deeply about this and think it isn't what we do currently, maybe you have some ideas.</blockquote> And we did have a few things that came up in that thread that I think are interesting starting points for games and tables looking to produce a highly postmodern experience. <br/><br/>Bill mentioned playing John Tynes' <a href="http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_powerkill.html" rel="nofollow">Power Kill</a>, a "meta-role playing game" that sits on top of your existing game and deconstructs it \u2014 that is produces a critique of your game's violence with respect to what the consequences would be if you engaged in sociopathic "kill goblins and take their stuff" behavior in the real world. <br/><br/>I followed up with a design observation: Seth Ben-Ezra's game <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8445" rel="nofollow">Showdown</a> has that strain of deconstruction baked right in. St Vincent's game "kill puppies for satan" deconstructs even that deconstruction; in the "real world" of kpfs, satan rewards you for your evil (puppy killing) behavior with evil points which you can use to do evil things, which makes people hate you, which motivates you to do more evil stuff.<br/><br/>So, deconstruction. How do we expose the assumptions of foregoing games and get rewarding play from inverting them?<br/><br/>Simon, among others, was interested in the interplay of parody vs postmodernism. The former is frequently employed by the latter as a technique, but not every parody is a pomo production (or is it?). How do we make parody serve postmodern ends?<br/><br/>Matthijs brought up <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3144" rel="nofollow">the Hippie Method</a>, and suggested that it has nuggets to be mined for play as a postmodern production. What can we do with this?<br/><br/>Nick, among others, suggested that all RPGs are postmodern, that you can't avoid it because of the nature of the medium. To what extent is that true? And what does it mean for our understanding of our play and designs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234886/#Comment_234886" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T11:20:56+00:00" title="September 30, 2009 11:20AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2009 11:21AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So a game that is referential to itself or its milieu?  Hackmaster 4 was referenced, and it has always mystified me that people seem to play that absolutely straight.  Somebody should interview the design team.<br/><br/>It is impossible to play Drowning and Falling without simultaneously appreciating and poking fun at the hobby's roots.  I think.  It's certainly an intensely metagame experience.  <br/><br/>So are games that employ a heavy metagame component essentially postmodern?  Is commentary on unfolding play, either procedurally or socially, postmodern?  If so, how can that be incorporated in ways that aren't parody or heavy-handed commentary?  Like I said, I have no dog in the fight and know very little about the topic, but I am always excited by the possibility for new ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234907/#Comment_234907" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T14:09:41+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  2:09PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A big part of how I approach the concept of postmodernism is the deconstruction of universal truths.<br/>Put differently, things cannot be known, only seen &amp; interpreted.<br/>Given that lens (which, granted, is a limited one within pomo discussions), I want to look at game design.<br/><br/><b>Does your game codify who a character is, in a permanent and fixed and universal way?</b><br/><br/>Dungeons &amp; Dragons gives you a Strength stat, and further it tells you that your Strength stat is a determinant in hitting someone with a sword. This design feature is antithetical to postmodern thinking, in that it asks you to construct a codified, rigid, universally-structured way of understanding the world. <br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard also has stats, but much more importantly it has freeform traits, like "My Weapon Is My Salvation 2d10". Suddenly we've kicked the door open to the notion that people define their own strengths, that how we view our own experiences is vital, and that our interactions are rooted in our perceptions. My dude might be an excellent rider, and an articulate fellow, and a compassionate lover and a good lay... but if I don't codify those things, they are only <i>colour</i>. I decide what matters in terms of how my character succeeds in the world, and in doing so acknowledge my character's priorities, worldview and self-conception.<br/><br/>Flags are a step further in this direction. Flags exist to say "this is what matters to this character's story." It explicitly assumes that narrative worth is rooted in individual goals and experiences, not in some cosmic scheme. Saving the world from Zarlok the Necromancer? It isn't <i>necessarily</i> more important than taking my half-elven daughter to see the Fountain of Memory, or building a mercantile empire, or hooking up with the virgin princess. It deconstructs the idea that there are universal measures of worth, and it says "what I want is more valid than how the world works".<br/><br/>A much bigger pomo leap would be to stop attributing (mechanical) worth to a character in terms of the meaning we've assigned them (Strength 17, "My Weapon Is My Salvation" 2d10, flags, etc) and start assigning worth in terms of what we experience of them. Another way to say this is: systematize action over classification.<br/><br/>One mechanic that does this is fanmail - giving narrative/mechanical power to others on the basis of actions taken (actions including narration of any stripe, here).<br/>Another mechanic is trust mechanics.<br/>Another mechanic that does this is Wushu's take-a-die-for-narrating-useful-action mechanic.<br/><br/>These break free of the notion of prescriptive power, and in doing so take down the idea that power is fixed, permanent, universally consistent or even codifiable.<br/>It puts everything in flux, and makes power relative and dynamic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234911/#Comment_234911" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T14:28:42+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  2:28PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An important element of postmodernism, as I understand it, is borrowing from disparate sources and slapping them together like some kind of Frankenstein's monster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234916/#Comment_234916" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T15:00:20+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  3:00PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2009 3:01PM by tony_dowler.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a couple of sense of postmodern here which I think are both legitemate. What Joe says above is 100% spot on IMHO. Post modernism is deconstructing the idea that the game has authority to state absolute truths in the fiction. <br/><br/>But in those games, system still has a level of authority over the fiction. There's another sense of postmodernism, I think, that's about taking apart the possibility of even entering into that sort of authority relationship at all. In D&amp;D, the rules define the absolute truth about my character's strength. in Dogs in the Vineyard, I define my own strengths and we interpret them and see them change in the fiction. To take it one step further would require a game that takes apart the entire notion of the rules or system having any authority at all. I think Kill Puppies for Satan and Powerkill are both in this area.<br/><br/>Also, WTF (<a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wtf.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://imago.hitherby.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wtf.pdf</a>), mentioned in the Things to Watch the other day looks like a beautiful postmodern deconstruction of RPGs to me.

Drowning &amp; Falling, Hackmaster.<br/><br/>Bricolage. The game borrows from, incorporates, or plays off of other games to achieve its effect. PowerKill.<br/><br/>Diegetic Relativism. The game is not committed to absolutist or realist methods of referring to the fiction. UA, DITV.<br/><br/>Irony. The game text means something other than it says. WTF.

What kinds of players will people create, and will they be able to reflect upon that act of creation as having some bearing on their own play in other games?

This is clearly an effort at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dislocation</span>.<br/><br/><b>Ghosts </b>has two of the players take on the role of lovers who kill one another, and later re-appear as ghosts, urging a new set of lovers in the same hotel room towards repeating their violence. <b>Doubt </b>tells the story of lovers, who are also actors playing characters in love - with different players playing their onstage and offstage versions.

So I'm going to coin the term "interludicality" to refer to the quality of referring, often ironically, to other games in order to achieve its effect. Alternately, we could scrap the category and simply regard inter-game reference as a kind of reflexivity; the two are perhaps linked. On the other hand, a game can be interludic without being terribly reflexive; imitation is the sincerest &amp;c.\n<blockquote>Reflexivity.

It is absolutely a question of degree. Compared to other forms of literature, roleplaying is extraordinary in its blurring of boundaries and so forth. But I think it's certainly possible to imagine "philosophically modernist" roleplaying, characterized by (a) earnestness (i.e., the suppression of reflexivity: "listen, we're just here to play; it doesn't <i>mean</i> anything"), a heroic auctorial sensibility (i.e., the suppression of interludicality: "this game is revolutionary!"), diegetic realism ("the game mechanics are the physics of the world"), linearity (i.e., the absence of recursivity: "you are not your character"); and contextualization (i.e., the suppression of dislocation: "the game is not the fiction"). In some cases, those are hard-won design insights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235086/#Comment_235086" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T13:16:07+00:00" title="October  1, 2009  1:16PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I was doodling this idea for a dungeon-delving RPG in which the characters know themselves, and refer to each other, in terms of their MMO "roles" (tank, healer, whatever).

Again, not necessarily pomo but it blurs those lines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235140/#Comment_235140" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T18:29:38+00:00" title="October  1, 2009  6:29PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is probably the only way I could happily play something like D&amp;D; again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, see SCOTT PILGRIM for this sort of thing portrayed in comics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235987/#Comment_235987" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T17:01:49+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  5:01PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I was doodling this idea for a dungeon-delving RPG in which the characters know themselves, and refer to each other, in terms of their MMO "roles" (tank, healer, whatever). Basically D&amp;D4 characters whose entire society is built on the fact they self-consciously exist within D&amp;D4. Weapon stats and magic spells are known by their stats, stats themselves are commonly understood professional lingo, etc. There are of course also professional "mysterious old men with maps" whose job is to advertise nearby dungeons via MLM-style map sales in taverns.

Similar to this. Have the d20 style classes as Tank, Healer, Blaster, Ranged, Summoner, etc. And be more explicit about it.<br/><br/>This could go tongue in cheek / humorous very easy which is not bad, just not my intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236012/#Comment_236012" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T18:23:03+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  6:23PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Three cheers for <i>Fortress of Woe</i>!<br/>There's alot of great potential there!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
