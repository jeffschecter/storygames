I haven't even really read any versions of it.  This is based entirely on previews and third-hand accounts, so I might be operating in error here.  Also note that this is basically a personal reaction to it; tastes vary and I'm not really trying to sway anyone to my point of view.<br/><br/><br/>So.  Freemarket.  I read about it and I think "Hey, this looks pretty neat" and then I read some more and I think "Hrm something is not quite right here" and even later on I think "What fresh hell is this?"<br/><br/>So.  What is it about Freemarket that strikes me as dystopian?  I had to dwell on this for a bit, but I think I've narrowed it down.<br/><br/>The premise of Freemarket is, to the best of my knowledge:  "Your worth is determined by your level of public approval."<br/><br/>That's something I personally find objectionable.  To the degree that it is morally repugnant.  It contradicts some important things I believe in.<br/><br/>Of course, that doesn't inherently make it unsuitable as an rpg setting.  No one wants to pack their bags and move to Apocalypse World either.  But it would certainly have a deep impact on how I would play the game, and I can imagine how much tension there would be with players who take a more utopian view of the place.<br/><br/>But feel free to drop by my orbital any time.  It has all the artistic integrity of American Idol, the high fashion of Crocs, and the innovation of FarmVille.  If you see the Empress Paris Hilton, be sure to say hi.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275494/#Comment_275494" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T06:39:52+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  6:39AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2010 6:40AM by Thunder_God.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger, but here's a question, isn't that the whole point?

Is a game about friendly competition, cooperation, donation and friendship supremely unappealing? Why is the near-universal first impulse to take a dump in utopia? </blockquote>\nSo then I became a bit insecure that maybe I was just having a knee-jerk reaction to a non-crapsack world.<br/><br/>But as I thought it over, I think I have a real basis for my reaction.  So I felt like sharing.<br/><br/>It warms my heart to hear that Freemarket can support this sort of griefer approach.  Dudes who are all about the counter-culture, who see poverty as a virtue, and popular appeal as the worst sin.  It also sounds like it supports the story of those guys totally selling out, which I'm definitely chuffed about.<br/><br/>I guess I also sort of post this as a Cautionary Tale, that if there's some people at the table who are like me, and there's also some Pure Utopians, that dangerous times lie ahead.

I think it might just not be the Utopia you're looking for. Which sounds like a punk rock don't sell out to the man never be happy and try to cause as much chaos and problems for others as possible type of Utopia. Which... well, if you're into Anarchy, I guess maybe that system of government would work better for you. But I'm fairly sure it wouldn't be defined as "Utopian". Feel free to disagree.<br/><br/>Not that I'm saying (from all the descriptions and podcasts of Freemarket I've heard so far) that the donut sounds all peachy keen. There seems to be plenty of violence, competition, and even ne-er do wells.

And interestingly enough, among the trillions of happy citizens that make up the Culture, is a teeny thread of perpetually dissatisfied assholes.

But I'm holding the line at non-utopian.<br/><br/>Lots of people seem to think it's plenty utopian enough for them, and that's fine -- it is a pretty personal reaction, and it's a feature of a game setting that it can speak to people in this personal sort of way.<br/><br/>I don't find myself particularly swayed by "Well, yeah, but it's a lot better than the society I'm living in!"  That sets the utopian bar far too low for my tastes.<br/><br/><br/>Guy cuts to the heart of the matter by asking "What do you believe your worth is determined by?"  A fair question, given that I opened up this territory.  I think I would describe it in terms of purity and fidelity to one's own personal vision and goals.  Culminating in an independence from popular opinion and approval, in contrast to a Freemarketian dependence on those things.<br/><br/>Would that change if I found myself in the orbital?  Hard to say.  I hope not, but societies are pretty good at using all the carrots and sticks available to them to bring everyone into conformity.

I don't know.

I'm a utilitarian (populist) at heart, so we'll never agree on this one--fundamental difference in premises (and VERY few people will actually re-consider basic premises of metaphysics/metaethics).<br/><br/>Fortunately, neither opinion speaks to utopia, dystopia, or anti-utopia, excepting in how a social structurre suits one's particular metaethics.<br/><br/>And that's sort of what I was gonna point out, coming back to post here again: we seem to have two threads going. One is "what is dystopian" and the other is "why does Freemarket give me an 'ick' feeling; and does it make you go 'ick,' too?" The former should be its own thread (possibly on a politics or philosophy site); the latter is a poll, and to answer: No, I don't get an "ick" feeling from it, from what I've read about it or from the particular element of its setting that you point out/have interpreted from the rules. I don't even find it to be a moral statement, per se; rather a neigh-mechanistic result of post-scarcity. All you got is identity/personality to trade, and the only metric of your trade worth is how many folks want your ideas around them.<br/><br/>As I posted above: Post-scarcity, the only currency will be social, and the only paupers will be assholes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275592/#Comment_275592" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T12:11:24+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 12:11PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2010 12:12PM by Thunder_God.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, you're straw-manning.

Sounds like fucking utopia to me.<br/><br/>Now if I play the game and the emergent thing is this sort of dark horror-feeling underneath all the happiness, then I'd take a second look and re-evaluate my "at face value" judgement.

you believe your worth is determined by?"</blockquote>\nReally? I thought he absolutely cut to the heart of the matter with his follow-up question: "If you moved to Freemarket, would that change?"<br/><br/>I mean, isn't that the killer app right there? You can just <i>play someone exactly like yourself trying to pursue the life they want for themselves</i> and see whether or not they succeed on social-currency terms. You can experiment with precisely the question of whether or not Freemarket would allow you pursue your own vision of "self-worth" and whether or not society responds to that vision.<br/><br/>The implicit addendum to the question is "Would it have to?" Or would you be able to succeed on your own terms in a world governed by these principles?<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't see much of a contradiction here. Just because my self-worth is independant of popular opinion doesn't mean that popular opinion might not respect me as a person, and consequently value my contributions highly. This is kind of how modern society is supposed to work, after all -- everyone gets to do their own thing and the perfect everglorious hand of capitalism works its magic so that everybody benefits. When I see this game it makes me want to put that to the test -- but it hardly looks to me like it has anything to say about whether or not society actually knows best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275747/#Comment_275747" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-12T16:58:51+00:00" title="June 12, 2010  4:58PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It hardly looks to me like what works or doesn't work in the game has much bearing on what works or doesn't work in the real world, if things were set up this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275750/#Comment_275750" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-12T17:23:06+00:00" title="June 12, 2010  5:23PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2010 5:23PM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>We're also told why life is beautiful and correct in Paranoia.

I applaud Zac for his inexhaustible amiability, but even in Marxist mode, I have a far less charitable disposition.<br/><br/>I've only looked at brief summaries of the game's mechanics, but is there only <i>one</i> metric of public approval used to measure the worth of everybody, from an Einstein to a Beiber? I know that's the way things worked in Cory Doctorow's <i>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</i>, which I'm guessing was an important inspiration for the game, but for me that was the book's least plausible aspect. After all, most of us certainly don't think of the importance of popularity as though there was just one single metric. I'm morbidly obsessed with the opinions of a few dozen academics who read the same journals as I do. But Paris Hilton-style fame holds no appeal at all for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275873/#Comment_275873" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T02:34:30+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  2:34AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just so you know, you don't get any Flow from producing ephemera (like sex tapes, songs and lolcats) [IIRC].

A lot has come out of this thread so far, so thanks to everyone.<br/><br/>I think my underlying issue with my understanding of the game (which I haven't even read, so it's entirely my own fault) is that I don't know what the game means by "post-scarcity."<br/><br/>My naive understanding is:  There's no scarcity, man!  You're just some random dude and you decide you want a solid gold toilet?  Poof, it's yours.<br/><br/>Now, I'm starting to get the impression that that's not actually the case.  Which is fine, but it leaves me thinking that the economy is a lot more conventional than it might first appear.<br/><br/>If that is in fact the case, I find myself worried about inflation, but again I don't know enough specifically about the setting to nail it down.  Do people just wake up every morning with X more currency to distribute?  Because that has hyperinflation written all over it.<br/><br/>If it's a zero sum game -- if everyone needs to hand out one Frownie for every Smilie they distribute -- that would be... interesting.  But I'm feeling pretty confident that's not the situation we've been handed.<br/><br/><br/>If someone who is familiar with the game could shed some light on these specific issues, especially the "post-scarcity" thing, I'd greatly appreciate it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275931/#Comment_275931" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T10:05:33+00:00" title="June 14, 2010 10:05AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2010 10:06AM by lordgoon.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite><br/>My naive understanding is:  There's no scarcity, man!

Other commodities that people want for more frivolous reasons - gold toilets etc. - might still have to be competed for. The idea that status points would serve as a base currency in such a world is one popular hypothesis about what its economy might look like, but others (e.g. Iain Banks) have described post-scarcity societies quite differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275949/#Comment_275949" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T11:07:37+00:00" title="June 14, 2010 11:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This entire thread is an awesome FM actual play.

I'm ready to trust the authors that the donut is a good background to explore autogestion, social parasites and other issues about happiness in general, building interesting stories in the process.

You're just some random dude and you decide you want a solid gold toilet?  Poof, it's yours.</blockquote>As I understand it: Your basic needs are covered.  You get food, a tube to sleep in, clothes, and an internet-connected nanotech supercomputer in your head just for showing up.  Want a solid gold toilet?  Hit the neighborhood public 3d matter printer and make one: but it will cost you Flow because you're using station resources that are in more short supply.  But if you work together with some friends on it, you can make it cheaper, because the Aggregate wants to encourage cooperation.  If you cooperate really well and make your solid gold toilet <i>really efficiently</i> the Aggregate might even give you MORE Flow than you started with, because the Aggregate loves efficiency almost as much as it loves cooperation.  If you then proceed to give this toilet away to someone else, you'll get more Flow yet, because the Aggregate loves it when people do nice things, like give people solid gold toilets (hmmm, as a write this I'm giving myself more of a Paranoia vibe than I started with... I think that's because I'm writing as if the Aggregate is passing judgment on people and their actions: it isn't.  It doesn't, as I understand it, have that capability.  It responds to things as its programmed to.  "Gift?  DING!  Flow!")\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>Now, I'm starting to get the impression that that's not actually the case.  Which is fine, but it leaves me thinking that the economy is a lot more conventional than it might first appear.<br/><br/>If that is in fact the case, I find myself worried about inflation, but again I don't know enough specifically about the setting to nail it down.  Do people just wake up every morning with X more currency to distribute?  Because that has hyperinflation written all over it.<br/><br/>If it's a zero sum game -- if everyone needs to hand out one Frownie for every Smilie they distribute -- that would be... interesting.  But I'm feeling pretty confident that's not the situation we've been handed.</blockquote>Nope, that's not how it works.  You don't get any Flow for nothing.  But you also only need it for special things (like solid gold toilets).  You get Flow for making friends, for giving gifts, for getting Attaboys.  You lose it for ditching friends, and for getting Frownies, and you have to spend it to do mechanically meaningful things.  And you might have to spend it to save your friends if their Flow tanks.  You're allowed to Frownie any given person on the station once per day, and you're allowed to give out one Attaboy once per day (not to each person: one Attaboy per day TOTAL).  This is, apparently, supposed to work against Flow inflation.  People can't just give Attaboys to everyone to send everyone's Flow shooting through the roof.  Oh and I just remembered... neither of those are actually "per day" that was a mistake.  It's "per session."  Somewhere else someone asked Luke what that meant in the game world.  Luke didn't really answer but the person who asked ended up answering it for himself by saying that Aggie probably tracks Flow/Frownie/Attaboy trends and "unlocks" people's ability to give out more automatically at various times so as to avoid inflation.<br/><br/>Not sure if any of this is helpful, but it's how I currently understand it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276013/#Comment_276013" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T16:32:27+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  4:32PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>I think it matters for all the usual social contract reasons.

Your interactions with other residents of the Donut certain has a huge impact on your Flow (in particular friending and handing out Frownies/Attaboys) but, as far as I understand it, it's Aggie that actually gives you the Flow.  It seems to be a more concrete "currency" than Cory Doctorow's whuffie (or at least as far as it's described in DaOitMK).  As far as I understand it, when you go to print yourself a new pet monkey, both <i>you as a player</i> and <i>you as a character</i> understand that this is going to cost, say, 10 Flow.  One of the things I like about the game is that, IIRC, every single thing on the character sheet is a term in the game world.  People on the Donut talk about giving out Frownies and earning Flow for thinslicing.  It's possible they even talk about having "level 3 thinslicing" but I'm not sure it goes QUITE that far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276025/#Comment_276025" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T18:51:51+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  6:51PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite>whoa when was the last time anyone in this thread read a Culture book?

The Culture is the opposite of an aggressive expansionist empire.  It's a passive aggregate collective, if anything.  The Culture doesn't expand by militaristic means (let's leave Special Circumstances out of this for now).  It simply contacts a civilization, says to the population 'here's how we live', then likely absorbs everyone who groks what post-scarcity society really entails.<br/><br/>I can't speak to Freemarket directly (but I'm certainly going to get it when I see it) - but citizens of The Culture most definitely trade on either their social currency or cultural input - full stop.  Mental and physical attributes are right out in any civilization with autophysiology-at-will, a pharmacoepia in your head and the material capacity of a Mind at your disposal.

In the Player of Games we have a guy tricked into destroying a civilization because the Culture judged them too evil to leave alone(and for the culture this is like using a magnifying glass to burn an ant they deem to be too evil), and Use of Weapons is an entire tour of what the Culture does to those it doesn't like.

But no, obviously, that's not the point of the game either. And then people start throwing around incendiary words like "utopia" and that's downright scary -- Utopia is the anti-adventure, the resting state of dramatic tension.<br/><br/>I guess I'm pretty happy to hear that Utopianism isn't really where the Freemarket experience is, either.<br/><br/>Without really digging the inspirational fiction or having a clear bead on what makes gameplay fun, I have no idea what a game of Freemarket is going to look like. That makes me itchy but also intrigued.

myself in the "Not A Dystopia" group. I think it's easy to underestimate the depth of the culture shock that a transition to FreeMa would involve.<br/><br/>Take a typical human being: born in Asia, probably on a farm or in a small town, working a job that requires specialized knowledge and physical labor (farming, fishing, carpentry). To that guy, the elevator pitch of The FM sounds AWESOME! <i>No death? No illness? Everyone has a place to live? Food available, just for the asking? SIGN ME UP.</i><br/><br/>Then think that FreeMa would be like an alien planet. Worse than an alien planet, a terrifying place where everyone looks human but acts alien.  I am personally terrified of the idea of living in that place. I'm more wired than 90-plus-percent of the human race, living a lot closer to the FreeMa model than my example person, and I still think the pace of change would be exhausting. Within a few months, my creative stamina would be drained, squeezed out of me by the pressure cooker, and I'd be a micro-Flow drone with the three-square-meter living space allotted to me by Aggregate.<br/><br/>The Flip Side: I imagine that what creates the wealth of FreeMa - the ability to give away the necessities of life and travel to and from the place - is that it produces a large part of the intellectual property of the human race, because it is an incredibly dynamic marketplace of ideas. In this way, the setting is very optimistic about human nature. Necessity is not necessarily the mother of ALL invention. Ingenuity, curiosity, and creativity are unstoppable forces inherent to the human condition! Even in the absence of necessary material reward (food, clothing, shelter), people can't be stopped from building, tinkering, improving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12290/freemarket-the-dystopia-of-freemarket/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12290/freemarket-the-dystopia-of-freemarket">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12290/freemarket-the-dystopia-of-freemarket/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12290/freemarket-the-dystopia-of-freemarket/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12290%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12290%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
