                    I want to discuss a trend I'm seeing of accelerated game development.  I'm not privy to anyone's schedule, but this isn't a concern about time as much as it is a concern about care - games are being released that aren't fully baked, and that worries me a little.  I'm not talking about layout errors, but rather mechanical errors or omissions that directly impact game play.  <br/><br/>Are there specific pressures that are causing people to truncate playtesting, or to rush to market?  <br/><br/>If you recently produced a game that took less than, say, six months from idea to glossy binding, I'd like to hear your thoughts.  I think it's telling that the games we consistently fall back on as bullet-proof fun often took years to perfect.   Anyway, let's discuss.<br/><br/>EDIT:  I'm as guilty as the next guy, banging out Drowning and Falling in like four months.  So I'm not scolding, I'd really like to see what this is all about.                </div>

                            I can speak to my own experience with Nine Worlds. It wasn't a quickly produced game (nearly 2 years). However, when I first put it in print, it was poorly playtested. Clearly, I should have done a better job there, and others should learn from my example.<br/><br/>The beautiful circumstance was that I could revise the text and not have 1000+ customers angry that I had done so. I had probably fewer than 100. People -- including those first customers -- were very accepting of my newer edition that came out 1 year later. <br/><br/>My point is that the nature of many of our productions is such that revising texts dramatically is feasible. I urge people to consider that, and take advantage of it. I've got no problem whatsoever buying a game released at GenCon this year again next year in revised format.                        </div>

                            The original version of <a href="http://www.valentgames.com/console.shtml" rel="nofollow">Console</a> took nine months from concept to published PDF, which is the fastest I've ever made a game on my own.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.valentgames.com/minigame.shtml" rel="nofollow">Minigame Magazine</a> was a month (or two) per issue when it was around, and it was 45+ solid pages of game each time. That was three of us working together.<br/><br/>I never had any complaints about the editing or rules on any of these. That may be because no one gives a shit about my games but me, but some of my friends are very nitpicky about these sorts of things.<br/><br/>As for why I did it? With Console, it was just because I could. The ideas flowed, the concepts were already there, everything just worked at high speed and that was that. With Minigame, it was part of the concept of a monthly magazine, and part of the challenge. That sort of got blown out of the water when one of my writers married the other one, who soon afterwards gave birth - they were a wee bit busy.<br/><br/>I agree with Matt that being willing to revise your book is a very useful and important thing. The fact that I do mostly PDFs helps that significantly - I don't have to do a full revision, I can just post an update for a rule change.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to point out that someone else was around a little while ago complaining about editing, missing rules, and so forth... and he got seriously dog-piled.                        </div>

I ended up cross posting a thread with a similar question from the other side. It seems to me that you should statistically expect more games which were designed faster. Part of the question then is when in the design and testing do you feel confident that your game is ready to be published? <br/>

I've got to disagree Matt. Yes, willingness to revise texts is commendable if they need it. That's great. But we have the ability to get it right the first time. All it takes is playtesting. Playtesting and the willingness to NOT release at Gen Con, which is the road that you chose for Dust Devils Reloaded and Matt W. has taken for Galactic. I think you both made the right decision.<br/><br/>Revising and releasing again the following year should be a last recourse, not a standard strategy.<br/><br/>To get back to Jason's core point, if you've got a good game, not having it at Gen Con when it's first released is not going to hurt it. Your dedicated fans will pick it up whenever it's released. They'll play it and talk about it and that will create buzz. And when the next Gen Con rolls around, you'll kick ass.<br/><br/>Here's what I suggest:<br/>1. Set an ambitious schedule. Go ahead. It will keep you motivated. Ambition is a good thing.<br/><br/>2. Leave at least several months for playtesting. Play it HARD. Get others to play it lots, without you there. Make sure the playtesting covers the full reward cycle at least once, and preferably several times over. In other words, a bunch of one-shots won't cut it if your game is intended to play over a longer term.<br/><br/>3. Leave yourself about a month to edit and copy edit the text (though I suggest an editor do a concurrent read during the writing and a second read during playtesting) and another month to layout the text (obviously you'll need less for a small text) and a month to get your stock back before your deadline.<br/><br/>4. If there's not enough of step 2, screw your deadline and delay. It's better to get it right the first time and be late than to deliver a shoddy product on time.                        </div>

                            Jason, I think the reason has been alluded to but a finger hasn't been pointed at it: GenCon.  Somehow, the indie design community seems to have hitched itself to a annual schedule that rotates around GenCon.  New releases are expected at GenCon.  We ask what this year's batch of new games is, and by that we mean what's being released at GenCon.  Designers -- and especially new designers -- see all of this and decide to shoot for GenCon.  And not any GenCon they're shooting for <em>next</em> GenCon, which gives them less than a full year to race through a full development and production cycle.  Things inevitably fall by the wayside, and the first thing is a rigorous playtest.<br/><br/>I know I felt some profound pressure to get <em>FLFS</em> out the door for GenCon.  The only reason I didn't is because I'm too damn cautious to travel across the country to a con I've never been to <strong>and</strong> release my first big game at the same time.  I'll release my game in my backyard when GenCon SoCal comes knocking in my neck of the woods.<br/><br/>I suspect there's also a perceived pressure to get your innovative game out the door before your innovations are no longer innovative.  I know Situation Engineering in <em>FLFS</em> would have been way cutting edge had I released it last year shortly after I wrote it, for instance.  Since then lots of folks have been doing lots of interesting things with situation creation, and now my situation creation mechanic will be one among many rather than some kind of lone pioneer.  I'd like to say that the trade-off for the solid game was worth it, but in all truth I won't be certain that it was until I start seeing actual sales numbers and AP reports.                        </div>

                            One thing I've come to feel with a certain set of games is that the core <i>game</i> is really solid but often the <i>text</i> needs further testing.<br/>
<br/>
I've read a number of games recently that didn't really have texts that fully, clearly, explained what they were intended to do and all the play procedures entailled in getting there.<br/>
<br/>
I think a really beneficial aspect of testing for games would be to find playtesters <i>outside</i> of the community here and have people run playtests based exclusively on the game text as-writ.  IMHO, that would really serve to positively increase the usability of the texts on the market.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2c.  And as I'm only now beginning to think about my first serious design for public consupmtion, I hope I haven't spoken out of turn.                        </div>

                            For me personally, I just have a short attention span. If I don't design at least a first draft a game shortly after inspiration strikes, it's probably not going to get designed at all. I don't have access to a committed playtest group, but I'm not charging for my games or publishing them in paper, so I don't feel as bad about releasing them to the world when they may still be half-formed. I would take more pride in one of my ideas finding their way into a great game than going through the stress of doing that process myself. :P                        </div>

                            Very interesting thread and something I've been noticing too. Unlike Matt Snyder, I will not simply buy a revised version of a game a year later unless I'm offered a reduced rate for being an early adopter. So putting your product out early and having it riddled with problems likely costs you my future purchase of your other games unless you take the hit to make it up to me.<br><br>I really don't understand the Gen Con release obsession. Given the large number of new games coming out each year now, appearing for the first time at Gen Con seems to be a risky proposition. I think coming out earlier in the year (like Roach, DRYH and Mortal Coil did) allows the buzz machine to turn your first Gen Con into a much bigger success. That's what I'm planning on doing with The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries - release in April or May and come into Gen Con more confidently. That will be a bit over a year of development, by the way, since it was a Game Chef '06 entry.                        </br></br></div>

I'm one of the guys that bought the original and the revised, Matt, as you know. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br><br/>And I'm happily playing in a 9 Worlds game right now. I do think people are understanding. But I also think there's a point at which people are going to feel that their trust has been abused. People don't want to pay to be beta testers/playtesters. If it happens once or twice? No big deal. If it happens lots, people are going to stop buying games the first year they're available.                        </br></div>

                            Primitive had a very short gestation period. I had the initial concepts kind of float into my thinking around early March, and the game was released at gencon. It sustained three groups of playtesters (one alpha, two betas) and a final draft con game (a few problems were cleaned up after this very late stage). Design and layout took a month, and all of the books were hand built over one grueling 9 hour sundown to sunup period a week or so before the con. <br/><br/>Primitive isn't a very big game, its simple and it didn't take a lot to write it. My current project is much more in depth (at the very least design wise). I'm looking for a Dex con release (but with a bigger distro then just traditional game stores and online). That means the game needs to work perfectly by the middle of january. I started working on the concept for this new game on the plane ride home from Gencon. <br/><br/>I prefer to work fast and try to get a lot out. I playtest a lot. I keep an editor working on every draft (editing while i write as much as i can). But that works for me now because i'm making smaller (less then 100 pages) games, and printing them myself. If i had my eyes set on something bigger (in terms of written volume, not playability, i feel like my games can be quite big as they are right now) i would want to slow down my schedual and give them some more time. <br/><br/>I am also of the opinion that there is a time in every project where you need to walk away from the thing and say "thats done, for better or worse, i'll learn from its mistakes and the next thing i poop out will be stronger for it." That time is always sooner then you think it is. Finnish. Walk away.                        </div>

                            For me it simply comes down to passion.  Can I maintain passion for a project over the long haul?  Then I feel free to take my time with it (eg Spirit of the Century, the Dresden Files RPG).  If I feel like I'm grappling with something elusive, and when I nail it, I need to run fast with it, it goes out quick or not at all (eg Don't Rest Your Head, which I put maybe 7 weeks into, but that was three weeks, followed by a year and a half of being shelved, followed by four weeks).                        </div>

                            In terms of the "seasonal round", I'm really glad the Roach debuted in spring.  I wasn't competing for mindshare with a bunch of excellent Gen Con releases and it allowed us to set deadlines that weren't etched in stone.  <br/><br/>I think there is a qualitative difference between print and .pdf offerings, particularly in terms of revision and correction.  I'm really talking about print here, which is all I know and what I generally buy.  <br/><br/>JBR, the innovation thing is definitely true - there are certain concepts that filter though the global brain and get extruded as similar mechanics, or rockin' games that spawn a whole fleet of similar work.  Related issue - concepts get dated, if only because you learn a bunch of new stuff as you work on a design and grow in your tastes and enthusiasms.  If it takes too long, your year-old stuff looks dated and lame, at least to you.<br/><br/>Kevin and Fred, did going to publication quickly influence the nature or quality of the final product, specifically in terms of system, mechanics, game elements?                        </div>

Not for me, in terms of my experience.  But I'd have to rest on other people telling me if that's the feeling they get from DRYH.  Does it feel rushed, or was it merely quick to bake?                        </div>

                            I know that feeling, where a project basically emerges fully formed, like a child of Zeus.  And you're right, we're the worst judges of our own work, until we start getting feedback - positive or negative.                        </div>

                            Jason, I think part of this comes from the lack of an audience for free games or playtest versions. What's the best way to get a lot of people to play your game and tell you about it? <b>Print it and sell it.</b> Would people have played Agon as much if John Harper had just had a sample version at GenCon and not one for sale?  Probably not.  And it would have taken a lot longer for him to have gotten the feedback that he needed to polish up some of the remaining issues with the game.  Would it have been better if John had taken another 6 months to a year and worked all the kinks out of it beforehand?  Yeah, probably.  But then I probably couldn't have convinced the folks at SG Boston to play it last week (and we had a kick-ass time doing so).  Most roleplayers, in my experience, don't want to play games that have not been "published."<br/><br/>Take another good example, Shreyas' Mridangam, from Push 1. As far as I know, the game has never actually been played according to the rules. There is still a lot of the game that is open to player interpretation and not explicitly spelled out.  Maybe it all works in Shreyas' head, I don't know.  Yes, it would be a lot more likely to get played if we had not put it in Push and had spent time getting a group together and playing through it.  Personally, I think the likelihood of that happening in a reasonable time frame is very small. There are very, very few people I know who are interested and comfortable with both roleplaying and dance, enough to really be able to work the text. It would have delayed the game by at least a year (maybe more) and, honestly, both Shreyas and I are more interested in other projects.  In some ways, it was important to get the game out so that people could learn from and steal from it and to lay the foundation for future projects (like Four Nations, which is clearly in its debt).<br/><br/>So, yes, I agree with you and Clinton (who's also been talking about this, partially because of his feelings about the first version of TSoY) that extensive playtesting should not be considered optional among roleplaying designers.  But I also think that people have different goals in mind when publishing games, and those should be considered as well.  It's bad when people regret publishing a game quickly and wish they had spent more time on it.  But I don't think it's safe to assume that everyone is publishing with the same intentions in mind.                        </div>

                            Perfect went from initial concept to Gencon debut in 4.5 months.<br/><br/>It was a number of factors:<br/>-I wanted to feel like part of the in-crowd. I was seeking approval, and all that stuff.<br/>-I'm a horribly impatient person.<br/>-For some reason, I felt like Gencon was a deadline. I work best on close, tangible deadlines - or at least, have historically.<br/>-I felt it was ready.<br/><br/>Was it ready? Not quite.<br/>Was it a smart thing to rush like that? No. I don't feel like I did myself justice.<br/>But... at the same time... I am glad it's out there, and being played. I'm happy about demo-ing it, and I loved Gencon and having a game there.<br/>Would I have been as pumped up about the RPG design community in a year if I'd released Perfect then?

                            I made Agon in seven weeks, including layout and editing.<br/><br/>I will unabashedly say it is a good game. I may not be the best judge of my own work, but damn, it's fun. Other people play it and enjoy it, so yeah, that's a success.<br/><br/>But it's not <i>as good as it could be</i>. I see that. But those words are my enemy. As Jared said once, "Better is the enemy of done." I needed -- like deep-down <i>needed</i> -- to finish Agon and get it out there for sale. I can dick around on a project for countless years and never finish. I have done just that on almost every other game project of mine. Agon had to be done, packaged, and sold. I had to put a stake in the ground and say something was finished. I had to prove to myself that such a thing was possible.<br/><br/>I'm very proud of the game. I'm glad I made it the way that I did. I'm happy that the pressure of the "GenCon release" drove me to work towards a complete, printable game, rather than an endlessly cycled collection of notebooks and vague ideas.<br/><br/>It's interesting that my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> game pick of the year, <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>, was also a short-cycle game design. I think that sometimes, (sometimes!) the sudden lightning-bolt flash of awesome is better than years of careful planning and testing.<br/><br/>EDIT: Yeah.

                            If I had released the first version of Verge, it would have really sucked. And by "first version," I don't mean the first thing I wrote down. I mean the thing I wrote down and edited and layed out and playtested and rewrote and so on, two dozen times. It sucked. I rewrote the whole fucking thing from scratch and even though it isn't what I want it to be before it goes to print, it's way cooler than the original.                        </div>

                            It's funny that I'm so far on one side of the design fence and so very far on the other side of the production fence.  When that dude showed up here and said "You losers need to proofread and edit your games" I laid into him.  And here I am saying "You losers need to playtest your games."  Not really, of course, but if there's a continuum I'm definitely on opposite extremes.  <br/><br/>So maybe there's a place for games that don't get adequately playtested or playtested at all.  I can relate to passion, and to personal goal fulfillment, and the desire to prove yourself to your peeps.  I'm no different.  Maybe it's the same argument - if you want to make yourself look bad, that is your absolute right.  If your layout hurts my eyes, I don't need to buy your game, but rock on.  Unfortunately I can't really make that judgment about playability until I've bought it, so as a consumer I react more strongly to incomplete / careless / hurried design.  And as a hippie self-publishing designer it indirectly reflects on me as well, because we're one tiny incestuous cat-house.<br/><br/>I do love you all, regardless, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>EDIT:  Also, it definitely is worth noting that inspiration happens in a heartbeat sometimes, as John said.  So "time" isn't the end all and be all, for sure.  A lot of great games get written for Game Chef and don't change much.                        </div>

                            I think there's a number of factors here. One is the increase in RPG design contests, like the IGC, 24-hour, Ronnies. Alot of games have come out of this. These contests force a condensed design phase, which I think influences people's thoughts on the design process. No more is design about spending months tweaking a system---now it's about pushing something out really fast. I feel these contests have influenced alot of people more than we normally think.<br/><br/>Second is the Dispora. Back when design was centralized at the Forge or RPG.net or where ever, you would have alot of people giving feedback, telling you when things worked and when they didn't. Now, when design in private or among a small network of friends, people can be lured into a false sense of security. Also, finding a good spread of playtesters have always been hard, but the whole dispora thing makes it even harder.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Ahrens</cite>One thing I've come to feel with a certain set of games is that the core<em>game</em>is really solid but often the<em>text</em>needs further testing.<br/></blockquote>
I want to comment on this---something I learned from <i>The Mountain Witch</i> is that the game text is half of the game. Good mechanics don't mean much if the players don't understand how to use them. This has been my problem with tMW. Being able to explain the game requires alot of playtesting by people other than yourself.<br/><br/>Part of this issue will never go away. As I said before, finding a good spread of playtesters is hard. Part of the issue is that the people who are willing to playtest games are often people with a lot of experience, who are able to fill in gaps in the design. This makes you think your design/writing is sufficient. It's only after you get your game out that you realize that it isn't. This was also an issue I had with tMW.<br/><br/>Also on the GenCon thing---I can understand this. The thing with GenCon for me is that I know that if I release a book there I can sell a bunch of books right off the bat and make back my printing costs, or at least alot of it. Who knows how long it would take me to recoup my costs if I didn't? Also, even if I don't sell that many books there, it's still a great advertising opportunity. It spreads the word real fast that you have a new book.                        </div>

<p>This is something I've chewed on long and hard. Certainly, my 1.0 readers and players shouldn't be stiffed; they trusted me to make something good and they deserve particular treatment for that.</p>
<p>Jonathan is absolutely correct: I couldn't get enough people to playtest Shock: until it was a completed object that they'd paid money for. I certainly couldn't get them to reread the text for subtle omissions which required an intimate understanding of the game.</p>
<p>So the people who did, paid money for it. I'm very thankful to those people. They have earned me money, they have paid for another print run, they have shown me that the idea is weird but speaks to a need elsewhere unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Here's a bennie I propose: error bounty hunting.</p>
<p>If someone points out an error first, they will get a copy of the next edition for free and signed with thanks for the assistance. It's a reasonable price for me to pay and they have system support for doing it, not just griping about it to their friends or something. It builds your relationship with a fan, and as importantly, it builds a relationship with a fan <em>who found flaw in what you did.</em> That fan has a diminished view of your work now, and you can make up for it in trade for a valuable service they've provided.</p>
<p>I agree that a book should be polished before it hits the streets. But we don't all have BWHQ at our disposal. The crew here in the Massachusetts School (as JBR called us) are all working on games all the time. We can only help each other so much.</p>
<p>Someone (I've lost the link) set up a distributed proofreading service. I don't know how or if these ideas relate. But together, it seems to me like we can generate better products.</p>
<p>(I'm chewing on the problem of release at GenCon vs. some other time. It might be a good idea, or it might not. I'm not certain.)</p>

                            Having had some experience with playtesting Savage Worlds from darn near the beginning, and now trying to find people willing to play the games I create, I can safely say that playtesting is key. Savage Worlds was looked at over and over again, played through by close to two dozen different game groups before it was released, and yet within a week, people were finding errors, mechanical issues, and so forth.<br/><br/>Look at D&amp;D 3rd. That playtest list in the back of the book is HUGE. And yet, the player handbook had close to 20 pages of errata.<br/><br/>Fred (Hicks) mentioned somewhere else, that a game needs a critical mass of people to play to spot the errors. When a person is playtesting a game with his core group of friends and maybe one or two other groups, he is going to get the false sense of security. This whole phase gets passed right over to focus on other concerns (like art) because the designer simply does not have enough people to critically look at his creation. And lets face it...playtesting takes the longest part of production if done right, and not enough people are doing it right.<br/><br/>And speaking of not being able to find enough players...how many of us always look for help to playtest our games, but rarely come through for others in a similar need? Sure, a con game here or there, a one-shot with the our regular group...but long term playtesting?  It's rare, because honestly, most of us are trying to playtest our own games.<br/><br/>Not to go too far off topic, but it would be nice if we could organize some kind of playtesting roundtable. You know...sign up to a list with your game, and when your turn comes around, everyone else on the list plays your game as one-shot during that month. Next month, everyone moves on to the next game. You wouldn't get long term play, but if you had a dozen or so groups giving your game a one-shot in a given month, it could provide some valuable feedback. Just a thought.<br/><br/>-Brent                        </div>

                            Maybe we need a middle road - the ashcan. With Great Power... used its preview edition to good effect, providing a view of the game as it currently existed that I could read, play, and offer feedback on knowing the final game was still to come. And Michael made sure to reward those who bought it by offering them a reduced price on the final game. Seems like a good way to handle development without selling an incomplete or inadequately playtested game under the guise of completed work (I'm not saying any particular person has done this - I haven't played most of my Gen Con purchases yet), yet I don't see anyone else using it.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with minor revisions and such that can be summarized in a free PDF and inserted into my copy of a game. But using publication as a means to get your final playtesting done seems wrong. Can't we get organized and help each other out with playtesting more? If that's the problem let's work on fixing that, not resort to premature publication.<br/><br/>Edit: Brent has a great idea there regarding playtesting.                        </div>

                            I'd just like to point out that we got three of our playtest groups for Burning Empires by using the Forge's Connections forum. One of those wasn't able to participate and one had to drop out about halfway through (though we got good stuff before then). The other gave us some invaluable feedback. We got one of the groups off of our forums and recruited another group locally. And we playtested ourselves. And i still think we could have done better.<br/><br/>There are resources at our disposal as a community. We have each other. We have the Forge. We have the Ads/Open Promo forum at RPGnet. There are now a ton of blogs out there, many of which get a fair amount of readership. We have friendly podcasts. And we have off-line friends as well. Finding playtesters is not an insurmountable problem.                        </div>

                            I can't even conceive of the difficulties in arranging playtests for something that's as long-form as Burning Wheel/Empires.<br/><br/>That said, for short-form games, the LA Games Playtesting Circle meets weekly and we only play published stuff when we don't have something to playtest.  If'n you need playtesting, throw me a line and we'll see if we can hook something up.                        </div>

I do think people are understanding. But I also think there's a point at which people are going to feel that their trust has been abused. People don't want to pay to be beta testers/playtesters. If it happens once or twice? No big deal. If it happens lots, people are going to stop buying games the first year they're available.</blockquote>
Personally as a consumer, I consider even once to be a dealbreaker.  It is compensated for if you provide free the new material, but is still a negative mark in my book.  For example, I bought True20 as a PDF, and when they offered a heavily-revised (and much expanded) PDF a year later, they gave it free to everyone who purchased the original.  That impressed me reasonably.  <br/><br/>So if you revise within a year or two, then I'm not buying the new one -- at least not for another few years.  If you provide the updated material for free, then I'm reasonably satisfied though hardly impressed.  If you don't provide the updated material free, then I'm unlikely to buy any new releases from you.  <br/><br/>That may seem harsh, but I don't like low standards for games.  (This can be offset if you specifically label your first release a "preview" or "playtest".)  More generally, I'm opposed to the mindset where games are treated like periodicals and rushing to buy the latest new thing.  I'm willing to playtest in some cases, but when I buy a book I expect it to last.                        </div>

                            See, here's the thing about playtesting, bounty-hunting, and so forth: When it's free, as in a playtest, no one cares for it. The perception is, if it's free, it can't be worth much. However, you put a price tag on it, and people assume quality, and some will buy it. They'll buy something they wouldn't have bothered with when it was free, simply because a value has been assigned to it.  <br/><br/>Now here is the other thing on my mind: At least as far as I know (based on working with PEG and Savage Worlds), the decent thing to do is to provide a free copy of the game to the playtesters. The GM of any game group that playtested gets a copy of the final product, as any one who did serious editing or proofing on their own also gets a copy. Credit is of course also provided in the book. It's an incentive.  It's been my impression that this isn't the case with these smaller games. I may be wrong in my assumption, but it seems like the playtester just gets his name in the book. What incentives are designers offering to playtesters around here, the Forge, or rpg.net?<br/><br/><i>Edited for clarity.</i> </div>

I think that's poison in a can.  I know I feel that pressure, and working on a spy game when it seems to suddenly be the <i>zeitgeist</i> and there's a raft of them coming down every pipeline (including Ron Edward's) certainly is a little scary.  But honestly, it's a lot better in my mind to be working towards a solid game and (hopefully, someday) be known as a solid designer who's games are worth the cost of admission is probably worth the fright.                        </div>

                            John (Kim), while I respect your feelings about revisions, I sounds like you're arguing for publishing to mean the same thing it did 10 years ago, before POD became as easy as it is now.  Honestly, I think people are approaching publishing differently partially because publishing is cheap and easy now. <br/><br/>You can see the same thing happening in music, where any band can now put out their own CD. The sound quality and mixing isn't going to be as good as a professional studio release, but do people who purchased a band's demo CD feel cheated once the band has a major label release?  No.  They supported the band while they were just getting started and are excited to see the new, better material, even if it's just the same songs polished up.  Likewise, I'll be happy to buy a new version of <i>Agon</i>, if and when John Harper works the kinks out and really makes it sing.  But, in the meantime, I'm still gonna rock out to the "demo version" of <i>Agon</i>, because it rocks already.<br/><br/>Does this mean that game designers should release things that are less than their best work?  No.  But if they release things that are <i>as good as they can make it right now</i>, I don't think I can really fault them for it.  It gets their games out there, it gets people talking about them, and people really dig them as they are, even if they aren't as fine tuned as they could be.  For the record, I own both the demo and studio version of Dragonforce's <i>Valley of the Damned</i>, which are 80% the same.  But I still listen to the demo fairly often.  Even though the sound quality sucks, I like some parts of the original better (like the old chorus to "Black Winter's Night").<br/><br/>Also, like Shreyas says about <i>Exalted</i>, there's a pure passion in the original, imperfect texts that sometimes a more experienced and introspective revision can't quite capture.  Look at the special editions of the Star Wars movies.  Sometimes revision can be an enemy as well as a friend.  Sometimes you're glad you own the original.                        </div>

                            I agree with Jonathan yet again.<br/><br/>I want to say this, though: Agon is not a "demo version." That bitch is <i>done</i>. It works. It's good. I didn't release it so people could pay to playtest it.<br/><br/>Will I revise it, ever? Maybe.

                            I agree with John Kim that I don't want to buy something and find that it's been significantly upgraded the next year.  I'm not in the US.  Buying games is expensive, as the postage+exchange rate+fees can often double the cost of a game book for me.  I probably spend an average 6 months debating whether to buy a game or not, not because I can't afford to pay for the game itself, but getting shafted on the postage really goes against the grain.  I might not be quite so upset about paying for a new version of a game, but having to pay for the goddamn overpriced postage twice really turns me off.  It makes me feel that if I'm going to buy a game that has stupid postage attached, I'll go for something new rather than a new version of a game I already have from a game company that seems to be funding the postal system.<br/>
<br/>
Postage = the main barrier to me buying your game.<br/>
Paying postage twice = irrateness and me probably not buying anything from you again.<br/>
<br/>
It may not be fair, or fluffy and nice, but this is a pet hate for me and a kay factor in my decision to buy a game.<br/>

                            I remember well the 'game nerd fury' of... crap, I want to say "Ian" somethingorother, who was ranting on RPGNet and the like about second editions of indie games, and going as far as to basically blanket-statement-threadbomb any thread with a "recommend me!" title away from anything that had anything to do with the Forge, because he got burned on a bunch of purchases: Bought a handful of games, only to find out that they were "revised" or even essentially rewritten a year after they came out.<br/><br/>There was a lot of talk about "that jerk Ian" or whatever, but I tried to kinda "rub peoples' face in his words". Because, deep down, he loved and played the fuck out of these games, and it Just So Happened that that year (last year? Maybe 18-24 months ago) a lot of games were seeing second editions or revisions within one year. It wasn't a conspiracy, it wasn't an oversight, it just happened that, like, a lot of 'heavy hitters' in the indie world (heh) just happened to be revising their games because they were unhappy with parts of them, and these revisions all happened to be within 1-2 years of the game's initial release (just one in many cases), and all these revisions just happened to come out at the same time.<br/><br/>So this Ian guy got burned, and shit, yeah, it was just a massive pile-on of coincidence and happenstance that led to it. But there WAS a lot to take away from his loud criticism: Basically, if you realize within a few months that your initial release was so full of holes that you just HAVE to revise and re-release it THAT quickly, then You Did Something Wrong. <br/><br/>In some cases, nothing Wrong was done, but you came to realize after seeing X, Y and Z that you could have done so much better. In that case, perhaps waiting longer to see what other influences will come along, would be the optimal choice.<br/><br/>I dunno, I'm not an Official Designer yet.  But I did see this Ian and other guys get burned because they spent money on a game right at its release, only to see the game get completely reworked and revised within a year. The designer owes them nothing when it comes down to it, but it is like shaking the willow branch, watching potential returning customers let loose their grip and drift away...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I suspect there's also a perceived pressure to get your innovative game out the door before your innovations are no longer innovative.  I know Situation Engineering in<em>FLFS</em>would have been way cutting edge had I released it last year shortly after I wrote it, for instance.  Since then lots of folks have been doing lots of interesting things with situation creation, and now my situation creation mechanic will be one among many rather than some kind of lone pioneer.  I'd like to say that the trade-off for the solid game was worth it, but in all truth I won't be certain that it was until I start seeing actual sales numbers and AP reports.</blockquote>
Way.  Just looking at the pace at which people turn out ideas that make mine look like a shrinking violet makes me nauseous.  So there's definitely a continuous (and continually stronger) push to get an idea and bring it to fruition before one of you lot manage to think yourself into the same corners.  In a way, it propels me and motivates me.  But I can also see someone ganking playtesting early to make sure that their plot of ground is safely staked out.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The concept of the 'eternal beta' is also with us from the software industry, and now with the web.  Get your product out, start selling it to the early adopters.  Use those early adopters as your core playtest group, then come out with a bigger, shinier version of your product and pump more money into it to spread it farther.  Rinse and repeat.                        </div>

Very true ... BUT ... and now I'm going to start throwing out a hook that might reel in a big fish I can't tackle ... if, say, I have an amazingly awesome idea for fripperizing the narrative choculata, and I see that Jason Morningstar also has an idea rilly rilly close to that ... say frapperizing the narrative chocumata, if Jason Morningstar gets his game out first (which he will, because he's one of them 'prolific' folks), when/if my game hits your local IPR factory outlet, it's going to look a) derivative of another game, b) derivative of Jason Morningstar's game, and/or c) may not even be as good overall.<br/><br/>The whole point of the indie movement is to champion the creator.  About the only other field of interest that I have in which I have a similar catalog of actual people's names at the tip of my tongue is comics.  The name of the creator has weight - weight that they've earned.  But that's also a weight that can accidentally crush my game's windpipe.  Not that I begrudge anyone their hard-earned recognition, but as someone trying very hard to put out my very firstest game, I'd like all those very prolific, very good and very known creators to innovate as far away from me as possible, headed in the other direction.<br/><br/>It's like playing <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> around here sometimes, only I'm the only one who's not a colossus, y'know?                        </div>

                            I totallty understand the pressures to get stuff out by Gen Con, and to get "your innovation" in print before it becomes part of the gestalt mindthink. I've definitly had days where I go "well, crap, I'm never going to get that written before someone else does."<br/><br/>But, and here's where playtesting comes in, I don't think the quality of a game, or the sales of a game, corrolate to innovation. A well-playtested, less-edgy game will do better in the the long run than a poorly-playtested innovative one. I think, at least. <br/><br/>Of course, there's the people who can bust out the edge AND get solid playtesting, and that's the sweet spot. And there are a very few that can write solid games without playtesting (though I think some of them are lying). But I think the "innovation race" is, at root, poisonous and something that we each need to think about and come to terms with.<br/><br/>That said, both of my fully published designs took over a year to get out, and I still feel the hurt of not getting enough playtesting on either of them.                        </div>

                            Other people innovating doesn't bother me at all.  I don't know if that's because I'm working deep out in Left Field (which honestly is just a myth I tell myself to make me feel special), but I have confidence that any game I produce will be a totally unique creation, even if it shares the same themes and design concepts as someone else's game.  Because my games don't feel like anyone else's games.  And I'm sure, Kuma, that your games won't feel like anyone else's games either.  They'll feel like Kuma Games, chock full of yummy Kuma-ness.<br/><br/>Competing with other designers is great if it pushes you towards awesomeness, not if it stresses you out and makes your game worse.  And the easiest way to make sure the competition is healthy?  Talk regularly with the guy who's running alongside you.  It's hard to feel threatened if you're going on a jog together, instead of competing in a race.                        </div>

I just want to state my agreement with that.

<i>Books aren't upgradable!</i>  I have no problem with this model for software because I can always download the necessary patches, upgrades and new releases with a minimum of effort.  They don't render my old one obsolete.<br/><br/>If I have to buy a new book within a year or two because their are substantial changes (something that can't be fixed with a couple of notes in the margins of my copy) that render my game incomplete, obsolete, or otherwise fucked up, then I'm going to be pissed!  If you think you might have to do that, don't go to print!<br/><br/>A PDF of a game has been established as a great way to get your game into people's hands, and it's easily upgradable.  Free (or cheap, as long as it's not done multiple times) updates to the new edition of the PDF of a game, that's great, you're customer has the full edition of the game they paid for.  Lots of great games were around as PDFs a long time before they went to print.  If you really want to go to print, do it, just be sure you're ready first, because you're the only one who really knows.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JonathanWalton</cite>Jason, I think part of this comes from the lack of an audience for free games or playtest versions. What's the best way to get a lot of people to play your game and tell you about it?  <b>Print it and sell it.</b></blockquote>
As a designer, my inability to get sufficient playtesters for my game is not my customers problem, it's mine.  I need to resolve it with whatever resources there are available to me in order to create a quality product, just like if it was a design issue or layout problem.  If I want to put out a quality product, these are things that I need to deal with prior to publication, no matter what it does to my dream production schedule.<br/><br/>Now, it is clearly a problem we face a design community, so it needs to be addressed.

                            I'll make mention of this, because I think it's germane.<br/><br/>We started the preorder for Spirit of the Century a week or so before I actually put in the orders for the hardcovers.  We made the PDF immediately available to folks who preordered.<br/><br/>During that week, a bunch of typos that had gotten past three different editors got caught, and a clarifying sentence or two was added into certain places in the text.<br/><br/>*Then* I uploaded the corrected version and put in the order.<br/><br/>And, <i>man</i>.

                            Starting with a PDF release sounds pretty good.  That way you can get the early adopters, but you can also update their product for free and get their feedback for the print version.  Some people might have worries about file-sharing, but hopefully those can be addressed.

Well, I have an answer which probably won't be popular -- as a community, we could make fewer games.  So rather than each person having two or three of their own designs, they could have at most one and don't rush to get it out.  Instead, wait for other people to playtest it, and instead of working on a new design of your own, you help playtest and give feedback to someone else's design.  A parallel to this is that we could give more respect to testers and reviewers rather than only authors.  (I say this a little biasedly, since I'm not really an author but I am a reviewer.)<br/><br/><i>Edited for grammar</i> </div>

Great idea in theory - but I have the Key of Making Stuff and most of my fun is coming up with ideas. I suspect I'm hardly unique, in fact not even very unusual, in this community.<br/><br/>Not an excuse for making shoddy games, of course. But a reality that we do have to deal with.                        </div>

That's just not how The Market (in the Adam Smith 'invisible hand' sense of the term) works.  The indie scene isn't at all settled or mature.  The greatest gain is to be made by prolific innovation backed by decent production, because the field is wide open and full-throttle.<br/><br/>As a community, I think that we need to value playtesters more - but since there's no economic upside to being everyone's playtester (other than free swag), there's no great rush to become a professional one.  If you're really good at playtesting material, there's a much larger incentive to publish your own game and playtest the crap out of that.<br/><br/>I'm hoping that Ludolab will eventually change that - by exchanging solid playtesting for the bounty of a slice of every game you test - but since I'm totally bogged down the technical aspects of it and I'm caught up in DEAD, it'll be a while before I get to that.<br/><br/>Ironically.                        </div>

I'd buy this argument for the 1910's, but the 1930's?!? The Adventures of Robin Hood, Bringing Up Baby, The Wizard of Oz, A Night at the Opera, Gone with the Wind?  These aren't just watched by film students -- they're still popularly watched.  Role-playing games are around 30 years old, so roughly as old as film was at that point (depending where you measure from).  <br/><br/>So, on the one hand, I think we've still got a lot of room for experimentation.  King Kong and Snow White, say, are pretty dated compared to modern-day special effects and animated films.  But I think plenty of games can and should aspire to classic status.                        </div>

Not to throw around words like 'incestous', but I think that a much larger, more diverse playtesting base is necessary.  After all, if I'm familiar with your work and your intent from all of your posting here, I'm going to play with those ideas in mind - no matter how else I try and break your game.<br/><br/>Playtesters who have no idea about the intent or background of a game are vital to keep a fresh perspective and get good results.  It's one reason why I'm send copies of DEAD to groups of friends who play games regularly, but who only have the sketchiest idea about the project - (i.e. it's a zombie card game, but there's roleplaying in it).                        </div>

                            Wow, everything I have to say got said! But I think sometimes a "Me-too" can do a world of good.<br/><br/>Just looking at my shelf, I see: Truth and Justice, I'm an early adopter, and though I got a revised copy of the PDF, my book remains "old-version".<br/>The Shadow of Yesterday, for which I own two versions, the second came out scant months after I ordered the first, without a note being given that it is in production(I actually like both systems).<br/>Nine Worlds, where I knew the new version was in the works so waited for the revised one.<br/>Shab al-Hiri Roach, for whom there are talks of revision/two new pages?<br/><br/>And that's it, aside from "Agon", which I intended to buy, but now will probably wait for a completed version, I don't like versions that are known to be problematic, and am willing to wait. I too live abroad, and each time I get a copy of a game that gets revised in short order, I feel angry.<br/><br/>I thought <a href="http://craniumrats.pbwiki.com" rel="nofollow">Cranium Rats</a> would take 3-4 months to complete, aside from the art/printing/layout bit, the writing/playtesting bits. I started working on it in February/March, and it's still under design. I personally want to release a PDF 6 months before GenCon as an optimal date: Gives time to word of mouth to spread, gives me a schedule I can violate, gives me 4-5 months of PDF in case something does need fixing.<br/><br/>But eventually, I'm going with "It's ready when it's ready, hopefully by next GenCon", which gives me 1.5 years of total design time.<br/><br/>As to innovation, my game is already mentioned on the Forge when it comes to "splitting a character", having each personality trait of a character played by another player, there's also the issue of <a href="http://competitiverpgs.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">Competitive RPGs</a>. My stance? It may be a bit of a bummer for derivatives to come out before the propagator, but it's not all bad. You can tell people, "The game that influenced X", or "If you like game style Z, you will like my game!". Think of Narrativist games, I think the early ones didn't compete with one another, but helped market themselves to one another's crowd, creating a market.                        </div>

                            I have the opposite problem: I tend to take an "it'll be ready when it's ready" approach to everything, and easily let stuff slip onto the back burner, which is why it's been about 2 years since I originally came up with the concept for <i>Tokyo Heroes</i>. But I'm really happy with how it looks right now.                        </div>

                            I wanted 1001 Nights out for GenCon, yes. I had been letting it slow-cook for a couple years, then spent a mad 4 months getting it FINISHED. And yes, there are things I want to add. I know I'm not going to the next couple GenCons, and I wanted to be there with my first game. Having a big deadline worked for me.<br/><br/>With YLQ, I expect to work on it for the next couple years, writing, tweeking, playtesting, etc. It'd be fun to release YLQ at JiffyCon July '08, or something.                        </div>

Sales at GenCon are by far greater than any other Con I know of. (I haven't heard of any other indie pubblisher selling 80-100 copies of a book at any other con.) So even if support at other cons increases, I think that the GenCon pressure will remain.                        </div>

                            Also to Clyde: my take on it is that I'm burned whenever I commit myself and my friends to lay aside time for an unengaging and frustrating experience due to faults in a product. Money comes into it only tangentally, in that I have stronger expectations that a commercial game will offer an enjoyable experience, but I would feel burned if I downloaded a free system that came with assurances and claims that it didn't remotely fulfil. Time is far more valuable to me than money, at least at the scales where my roleplaying hobby resides.                        </div>

Unless you also have the Key of Glittering Gold or the Key of Renown, why does this mean you have to publish?  <br/><br/>Here's the game as I see it: there's an unknown, slowly regenerating common pool of public goodwill towards games in general, and towards indie games in particular.  You as a designer have a reputation stat that starts at zero.  As you release games, you consume some of the goodwill, and stake some reputation.  A well received game will not only win you more reputation, but also regenerate the pool of goodwill.  But a poorly received game will do neither.  <br/><br/>There's the perception (as with any commons) that the other guys are using up the pool of goodwill, but honestly, I'm not sure there's truly a bottom.  It ebbs and flows, and right now I think it's running over the (very low) dam for indie games.  To extend the metaphor still further, if it continues to do that, the rules say that the dam will get built higher.  But a glut of half-finished games won't help that position, and it might turn back the tide on the pool.  There's a lot of name recognition in this niche, and I think we can also expect that half-finished games will also cost their creators.<br/><br/>The same probably goes for completed games that could use a second edition, even if nothing has changed except for the collective understanding of what these games mean and what their about.  Nothing more respectable than a solid second edition.                        </div>

Unless you also have the Key of Glittering Gold or the Key of Renown, why does this mean you have to publish?<br/><br/>Fair enough question. My point really was that the advice "Don't start anything until you've finished the last thing properly" is really hard advice for me to take. But if making something is fun, making something really good that other people also enjoy is even more fun. I just find that I have to go through a lot of non-fun to reach that point.                        </div>
