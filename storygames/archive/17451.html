It\u2019s my first time doing an actual play report, so I\u2019m a little high on na\xefvet\xe9 and adrenaline at the moment. Please excuse any excessive gushing. <br/><br/>For all my gaming \u201ccareer,\u201d I\u2019ve always been a player. Mostly, I\u2019ve played in one-shots and game-store demos because of a lack of real-world time. Last year, I had the time problem resolve itself, and I concurrently joined two different groups -- one for Pathfinder and one for the West End Games Star Wars. I really enjoyed being a participant, but I want to move from being in front of the camera and refocus my efforts to the production end of gaming. I want to GM. <br/><br/>I like the idea of playing homebrew settings more than established settings, so I decided that my group would build the world from scratch, using Microscope. It seemed appropriate because I want my players to be invested in the setting. I\u2019m also hoping to work in several story game techniques, but my players aren\u2019t very familiar with that type of gaming. To be honest, I\u2019m pretty new to this kind of gaming, too. So we\u2019re learning this together.<br/><br/>We first met a few weeks ago, and It was pretty easy to get started. We knew we wanted to do something in a more post-apocalyptic setting. One of my players had recently been playing mostly Pathfinder, and he was tired of a \u201ctraditional\u201d fantasy RPG setting. He wanted to see either a post-apocalyptic or cyberpunk genres. Considering that the other players enjoy games like Star Wars and Shadowrun, they were enthusiastic about the idea. So we started with the focus:<br/><br/><b>Culture rises again after an apocalyptic event destroys the world as we know it. </b><br/><br/>It\u2019s a very broad statement that could go almost anywhere. What was amazing was how quickly it became defined by the palette. We began discussing what the players wanted in the world, and I was surprised that they wanted straight out horror. I was thinking that our world would be similar to something like Steven King\u2019s The Dark Tower series, which has dark themes, but has a lot of light in it as well. Or perhaps something like Alas, Babylon, where nuclear war has happened, but people are making the best they can out of life. <br/><br/>I was really surprised how responsive the group was when it came to input for the palette. We had to refine some of the entries, but for the most part, they had put a lot of thought into what they wanted.  They were gung-ho!<br/><br/>The next part, the development of the initial periods, was a little more complicated. We had to spend several minutes discussing how periods work, and the general method of Microscope\u2019s top-down outlining structure.<br/><br/>Since I had the most experience, I served as the lens first. I decided to make an event and a scene focusing on the Supervirus Outbreak. The roleplaying of the scene was a bit awkward. In part, I think this was because the rest of the group weren\u2019t sure of the actual goal of the process. This had a couple of factors. I don\u2019t feel I explained it well, which was my fault. Another factor was the lateness. Our group is only able to meet starting at nine, due to family commitments and such. By the time we got to this point in the evening, midnight was fast approaching. <br/><br/>As an aside, I think the scenes are the hardest part of Microscope to do (the second hardest being Legacies). I think they can be very rewarding but it seems overwhelming to those I\u2019ve tried the game with before. After that first scene, we didn\u2019t do anymore. <br/><br/>Once the group understood the mechanics, the game began to hum along nicely. We managed to do two complete rounds, focusing on the first two periods before breaking for the evening. Our group is a bit larger than what the game recommends, so that added to the amount of time.<br/><br/>It was a few weeks before we were able to get back together, but we were able to get into the game with only a minor recap of the rules. Our session last night was good for a couple reasons. First, it was really cool to see my friends grok the world we\u2019re building. There were some fist-pumps when they realized how they could take different pieces that other people were writing and work it into their own entries. More than once, I heard them say to each other:<br/><br/>\u201cThis is such a cool world.\u201d <br/>\u201cYeah, it really is.\u201d<br/><br/>Some of the contributors did have a hard time expressing their ideas. So I did workshop some with them individually. Mostly, I had to ask questions to get the creative juices going. I also pointed out a few interesting things others had written and asked what kind of consequences they thought would come from those entries. At a couple of points, I had to remind the players that the collaborative part was done because they would suggest what they wanted to see. But overall, it went really smoothly. <br/><br/>Once again, though, time became an issue. We wrapped up at 3 in the morning. We may have gone a little too long, but we managed to add to all but three of the remaining periods. We\u2019re planning to have one more session to wrap up the world outlining. I then plan to flesh the outline out into a full history. A few of the players have said they\u2019ll help with the writing chores, which is a really good sign.<br/><br/>Overall, I\u2019ve really enjoyed using Microscope this way. I could have thrown together a homebrew of my own and then told the players to come up with characters. But Microscope makes the world in and of itself a multi-faceted character that they know. Once we finish the world, the players will have a lot of gaming goodies to choose from, which will make my job as a GM that much easier. I know that they\u2019ve got an investment into the game already. f you would like to see the outline we\u2019ve developed so far, you can view it <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B7fuDFOerwexNC1KUFdsa2phZGs" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395238/#Comment_395238" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T07:30:25+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  7:30AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!

What we lost on our creation being shared with the whole group, we gained on pace \u2013 we were able to do three whole rounds.<br/><br/>We chose the emergence of star gate system as a starting period and the re-emergence of star gates as an end point. We agreed that our SWN game would take place in the middle, at a point after the star gate system would collapse.<br/><br/>At first we concentrated on using wide brush strokes to flesh out periods and events on the scale of galactic humanity. On third round, we concentrated on the sector we would play SWN in.<br/><br/>The result was mostly the big events leading to the 'Scream' (the cataclysm where most psionics die and star gates are rendered useless) and a couple of other big plot lines. I used some of my voice to make up palette and events to comply with the general constraints of SWN play (I also got to create lots of other cool stuff). One other player joined that somewhat as he was familiar with Traveller-style play.<br/><br/>All in all, the results are very good. Our SWN game (we've played one session now) is based on the power struggle between BioCorp (de facto ruler of the sector with genetically engineered super-soldiers) and the psionic resistance that we created in Microscope. This was easy to negotiate based on our presentation of the results of our Microscope game to the rest of the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396183/#Comment_396183" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T09:23:15+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  9:23AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!

I've seen other people talk about using Microscope in this way, but this is the first write-up I've seen actually describing how it went and sharing information about the resulting world.  Thanks!<br/><br/>I've been looking for good mechanisms to generate storyworlds for VORPS (my online story game system).  This gDocs writeup doesn't seem far removed from a VORPS-compatible definition.  I wonder if I could somehow streamline the conversion process, so that you could go from creating a world to playing games in that world in one fell swoop.  It might also be a cool way to share these generated worlds with peers.
