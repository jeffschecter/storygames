In fact, I'm unsure if I have ever posted here; so don't worry if you don't recognize me.<br/><br/>I'm working on a Japanese-style fantasy game. The Japanese have a notable difficulty acquiring polyhedral dice, especially in rural areas; but d6s are in abundance, and is the focus of most of their games. <br/><br/>The basic Japanese mechanic, used in several of their games, revolves around rolling 2d6 and adding a value (with a widely varied range, anywhere from 0-50 or higher for high-level play) to that outcome, with 2 being an critical or automatic failure, and 12 being a critical or automatic success. Its simple, it's fast, and your training &amp; natural ability heavily outweighs chance.<br/><br/>It's also a little boring, and predictable. There are games that break from this approach, but this formula fits several of the Japanese games I am familiar with. I want to mess with the formula. If you are well-versed in Japanese games, your insight is even more valuable to me.<br/><br/>There are two Japanese Games I can find information on that differ from this formula (by that I mean I could find an analysis of the rules in either English or a form I could use translation software with). Arianrhod starts with a base of two dice, then adds in dice for skills and modifiers. Tenra Bansho Zero uses dice from your attributes and any dice coming up the same value as your skill (which ranges 1-5) is a success (so if you have a stat at 4, and a skill of 2, any dice that come up a 1 or 2 count as a success, and anything higher is a failure; Sixes are always a failure).<br/><br/>My <i>original</i> idea was to use the basic mechanics from SilCore (for those of you who don't know, you roll a number of dice equal to your skill rating, 1-10 with most people topping out at 5, take the single highest die, and add a value from your attributes, usually a +1 or +2) and modify it. I am no longer wanting to use that method. I now think I want to marry the method from Arianrhod with a modification of the Tenra Bansho mechanic, and add in a form of the Wild die from the old WEG's d6 system.<br/><br/>The following is the basic idea of the system. In it's final form, it will have an example and a piece of art depicting the method in play. I am checking the clarity of the rules as written.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">The basic rules for this system utilize multiple six-sided dice, used to form dice pools. Each Player is allowed to roll two dice, referred to as the base die-pool, for any task, whether they are trained in the skill associated with a task or not. Any exceptions to this rule are noted explicitly in those cases.<br/><br/>In addition to the two base dice allowed for every roll, an extra d6 is added. This die should be of a different size or color, or if preferred, rolled by the GM or another player. This die is called the Wild Die, as it introduces a radical element to the die pool. In general when reading the wild die, you ignore any value other than a 1 or a 6. Any time the wild die comes up showing a 1, something has happened to complicate the action. You remove it from the pool, and also remove the highest die showing in the pool. If multiple dice are showing the same high value, you should remove just one die. On a 6, your action has managed to succeed in a spectacular fashion. You may now count the wild die as 2 successes. GMs wishing to give such rolls more narrative weight are encouraged to do so by describing how the action was complicated or why it was so spectacular.<br/><br/>Training in a skill allows you to add dice to this initial pool, 1 die for each rank you have in the skill, rated 1-5. Once you have finalized how many dice reside in your pool, (Base + Wild + Skill = total dice pool) you roll them, looking for any dice that come up as a 6. The level of your skill also modifies this value; each skill level subtracts 1 from the number needed to count the die towards a success. So if you have a Skill of 2, you add two dice to your pool and need a 4 or better to succeed on the roll. Base or Skill dice that turn up 1 are called Opportunities, and are removed from your die pool <span style="color: #FF0000;">(this is done to exempt them from any re-rolls allowed by other rules)</span>. Base or Skill dice that come up 6 are called Surges, and give you one shift towards success <span style="color: #FF0000;">(surges are tied to another mechanic I'm not looking for feedback on just yet)</span>. Dice that come up showing a 2-5 count towards success if they match or exceed your Skill modifier.<br/><br/>The bonuses from your attributes add to the total number of degrees of success from your roll (provided that you have at least one from your dice). This total is then compared to an opposing roll or to a fixed Difficulty.<br/><br/>The Difficulty is the base # of dice counted as successes needed to achieve a given task, with the default being 1, and running up to 10.</span><br/><br/>Any thoughts would be appreciated. Notably, I am having a hard time deciding on the wild die. On the one hand, I would like something to break the artificial barrier that success is capped by the number of dice in your pool, as well as lending that slim chance of a situation beyond your control or that of your opponent. I also would like to avoid the exploding die dilemma of theoretically rolling absurd numbers of successes. Several people have noted they don't think my system needs the wild die, and that I could model this some other way, but they never suggested how I might accomplish that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malckuss" title="Malckuss"><img alt="Malckuss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malckuss">Malckuss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381404/#Comment_381404" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T07:53:40+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  7:53AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fully apologize for posting this here; I didn't realize when I posted it that it belonged on Praxis.

It's also, as you've found, hard to explain.<br/><br/>I think the Wild die is the good part. At high skill levels, it matters a little, but not as much as the skill does. At low levels, it can matter a lot, letting a character get lucky.<br/><br/>The part that could be ditched, I think, is the "each skill level subtracts 1 from the number needed to count the die towards a success" part. I would run simulations to verify this, but this smells a lot like a game breaking mechanic.<br/><br/>At the very least, it creates an environment where each new level you buy in a skill gives you more payoff than buying the level before. That is, not only do your chance of success increase as you buy skill, the <i>rate</i> at which success increases <i>also</i> increases. <i>All</i> games that do this encourage min/maxing. Expect characters to max out key skills and learn none of the others. If character role silos are "what you are looking for this mechanic to <i>do</i>", then maybe that is OK. Even so, I think it runs counter to your stated objectives: the difference between highly skilled characters and unskilled characters will be so wide, that you will likely need to tailor the game to highly skilled characters, at which point, throwing a luck bone to unskilled characters will never be enough to matter anyway.<br/><br/>If you ditch that part of the mechanic, it becomes significantly simpler to explain, and probably functions better as well. If you do this, you will find that a fixed 6 is too harsh of a target number. Set it to something that fits the feel of your game. Probably 5 for something grim and gritty. Lower for something very heroic.<br/><br/>(Also, you might take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Nomine_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">In Nomine</a>'s d666 system. It is much simpler, but perhaps a bit more elegant. Might not do what you want, though.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malckuss" title="Malckuss"><img alt="Malckuss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malckuss">Malckuss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382022/#Comment_382022" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T03:12:42+00:00" title="June 12, 2012  3:12AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1000 pardons, Wordman. I didn't mean to ignore you; I thought this thread had met it's digital demise. New thread over here:<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=561&amp;page=1#Item_13" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=561&amp;page=1#Item_13</a><br/><br/>I appreciate the feedback. Curious but true, the part of the mechanic you reference was an inversion of a mechanic in an existing JTRPG, Tenra Bansho. In it, your skill is the number you need to roll on the die, I.E.: skill of 2, you need to roll a 1 or 2 to succeed. I "turned it over" as I found that let you roll unskilled and succeed on a 6, and a skill of one let you succeed on a 5 or 6. My mistake was in making skills give both dice and a value reducer. In Tenra, the dice come from your attributes, which can go as high as 10 but most characters have at most a 6-7, and I have yet to see a pregen for that game with less than 4 dice.<br/><br/>However, it is a moot point now in that I have moved to a new system. For those who have read this thread only and don't feel like joining Praxis, here is a cross-post, edited for a tad more clarity.<br/><br/><i>I have overhauled the system. The other one could have worked eventually, but it would have taken time hammering it out which takes time and effort away from other design elements. I worked this out last night in the space of two hours. Give me your thoughts, please.<br/><br/>I call this system, "dice chaining." You start with a 2-die base, as previously. Dice can come from various traits as needed by the setting and genre, similar to how Cortex + works. I wouldn't suggest adding more than 10 dice to this base, as it would be unwieldy. Once the dice hit the table, players may sort the dice to form chains, either linking the dice by sequence(x, y, z) or by set (# of a kind; x, x, x). If you cannot chain any dice together, you may form a single "link" of one die, as long as it isn't a 1. You do not total up the dice (unless there is a tie or some other situation the GM feels it could aid in), but count the number of dice in the chain. This is the chain's length; i.e.: "I have a chain of four."<br/><br/>Th highest value in the chain is the important number, and is known as a chain's Impact. So, for example, if the last number in the sequence is a 5, or you made a set with multiple 5s, you have a chain with an Impact of 5.<br/><br/>To determine the effectiveness of an action, you take the length of your chain and add the Impact to the total. So, using the values in the short examples, you would have a chain of 4, with an Impact of 5, for a total result of 9.<br/><br/>Opposing dice chains can remove dice from the chain as long as the value on the die is higher. <br/><br/>Due to the way the dice work, there are multiple values that could be determined at once, similar to ORE. My brain hasn't processes all of the different applications it could be put to use just yet, but I'm excited enough by the prospects to embrace this as the core of my project. It fits two of my design goals: It's interesting, and it's simple.<br/><br/></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
