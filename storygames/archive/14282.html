I've found since GUMSHOE, that we use GUMSHOE as a verb sometimes when we get bogged down in rolling for clues or personal interactions - as in "let's GUMSHOE it." - a sort of informal hybrid. Our first release will be a Pathfinder/GUMSHOE crossover (PATHSHOE? GUMFINDER?) which has just completed playtesting. Playtesters are divided about 6:1 between great joy and blind hatred of this monster.<br/><br/>I'm considering other systems to hybridise; BRP, FATE perhaps. What system would you suggest, and why?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324281/#Comment_324281" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T05:56:36+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  5:56AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2011 5:57AM by Graham.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always wanted a Paranoia mash-up. I'm particularly into Paranoia/Cthulhu crossovers, but GUMSHOE seems especially suited for Paranoia. It lets you stop worrying about the investigation and concentrate on shooting the Communist traitor next to you. (Obviously, you'll rarely get to the end of the investigation.)<br/><br/>Either you can call Mongoose or I will.<br/><br/>Oh, hey, maybe Shadowrun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324292/#Comment_324292" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T06:54:45+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  6:54AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect that guidelines for older rulesets that tend to the simulationist would be more useful than the more modern, more narrative systems (such as anything FATE-based). Given the natural link between Call and Trail, I suspect that something for CoC or (perhaps more preferably) the newer generic Deluxe BRP would be very welcome; I also suspect that something for "Old School" movement games might also be interesting and welcome (such as Labyrinth Lord, Swords &amp; Wizardry, and other related games). Finally, something for the grand-scale "generic engine" games might be welcome: HERO, GURPS, EABA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324298/#Comment_324298" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T07:35:02+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  7:35AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a> Skulduggery or even Fiasco are a rather good fit for Paranoia, too, I think, though Mongoose vetoed a free Dying Earth conversion document some time ago (not at my instigation)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">@viktor_haag</a> I think that FATE would work quite well with GUMSHOE investigation.

Specifically in a short-story (1-2 hours tops) format.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we did was to kick out the technical skill names and substitute significant character traits. In order to spend from a pool, you had to bring the trait/theme into play. Oh, and we ditched the cumbersome damage system in favour of extra damage to the pools of losers, and loathsome in-fiction consequences of failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nEffect: A strong mechanical reward for delivering a rounded and diverse presentation of your character's themes and personality in the short time allotted to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this has nothing to do with the investigation bit, and short-story investigation can hardly help feeling hasty, I suppose. So, just to illustrate something else that the pool system can be good for.<br/>\n<br/>\n(For those not put off by danish, here it is for free: http://alexandria.dk/data?scenarie=3578)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324391/#Comment_324391" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T20:15:05+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  8:15PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, wow, I'm with Graham - Shadowrun would be just about perfect for this treatment, I reckon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
