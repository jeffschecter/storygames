It's a great metagame representation of the narrow bridge Mages cross when they go to assert their wills against the rest of the world in that game's metaphysics. When I play OWoD Werewolf, conversely, the act of actually rolling that 12, or 30, or 120 (really) dice for damage is a fun physical representation of what happens when Earth itself is on your character's side, and getting the dice physically handed to you by your friends as their characters Gift you up reinforces the importance of being a pack.<br><br>In <i>A Penny For My Thoughts</i>, one of the steps taken in each turn is to read the memory trigger you've drawn out loud, and to show it to everyone so they can read it silently themselves. That is a perfect activity, because it means that the person whose turn it is has to start talking, and everyone else has to pay attention starting now to the current segment of that player's character's story. It's fun - the mystery of the draw, the anticipation that it might be one of the triggers you wrote that comes up, casting about for questions you might ask about the trigger. And it organizes the start of each turn very effectively, too.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293702/#Comment_293702" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T23:28:14+00:00" title="September 16, 2010 11:28PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>Player activity has been defined as what players are actually <em>doing</em> and not the fictional action of the game.

Maybe I like it too much, I don't know...but it's the one thing that I really can't do without in an RPG.  If there's no conversations or bantering, then I don't even know why we're sitting at the table.  Getting both in-character and out-of-character conversations is just a basic requirement for having fun, as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>I'm indifferent to dice; I don't hate them or love them, they're just there.  But I do like cards, especially if I have a hand of them and get to choose which one I'm playing next.  I also like shifting tokens around in a resource-allocation system (like the one the Marvel Universe RPG used).  I think part of why I like this is because it gives me some strategy to think about, rather than being entirely subject to the whims of the dice.  <br><br>I like filling out a character sheet, referring to it during play, and looking it over/thinking about it/updating it during the week before we play.  It's this last part that I think I really enjoy -- it's basically prep for a player, and I don't care what you haters say, prep work is cool and fun and makes everything better.<br><br>I don't like big maps, or moving miniatures around on maps.  I can do it if I have to, but I'd rather not have to.  It's just finicky stuff that isn't fun to work with, and it feels like it moves slower than looser, more description-based action scenes.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293717/#Comment_293717" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T03:03:20+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  3:03AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2010 3:05AM by johnzo.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I play a flyboy in Danger Patrol, I will burn through stacks of index cards trying to doodle a space fighter onto my player marker that has wings of matching concavity.<br><br>Unless I'm playing in our regular game where I know everyone and their character, I will have a tented card in front of me with my name, and maybe my character(s) name(s) on it too.

Like a TCG or miniatures game building a character can be a fun "meta game" meta game is not used in the role playing sense but in the way TCG and miniatures players use it. Basically they see deck and army building as a game into it's self, these process have firm rules and limits that offer players a wide range of choices. handling this process away from the core game minimizes downtime and how much thought a game requires at the game table.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting to note is how a game like dominion takes something that was a meta game like deck building, and then reincorporates the process into a standard card game. It's a very interesting distinction of player activity. They each give something unique to their player bases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293792/#Comment_293792" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T12:41:32+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 12:41PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like "the doing" in games.

I really like sheets that are for more than just the characters. Any game that has a sheet for the GM is awesome in my book. I'd rather have something with guidelines to put my info on, rather than just blank notebook paper.<br><br>Cards are cool to use. Play TSR's old SAGA stuff; The Marvel Superheroes game or Fifth Age. The Cards represented the character's ability. It was an elegant and quick  way to handle damage, and lowered ability.<br><br>I'll let you know about FreeMarket after I try it.<br><br>BTW, your game looks REALLY cool. I have no idea how it plays, but it really scratches that itch I've been having for the last year for a card-based RPG. Good-looking design too.<br><br>OH, I forgot my favorite thing I'm loving about some RPGs these days: checklists/flowcharts. A step-by-step, easy to follow way to do things like Apocalypse World or Mouse Guard's character creation and FreeMarket's end of session procedures. Games with this type of "AI" really help me to de-stress actually.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
