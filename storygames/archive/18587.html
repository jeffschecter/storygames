We would love to be able to make actual print copies of the collection available to backers outside of the US, but we've chosen an usually large size (11"x11") for the book, and this looks like it will make overseas shipping costs even more unreasonable than usual. We're looking at around $50 minimum to Europe, probably more.  I can't stomach the idea of asking international backers for an extra $50 or more per copy, but absorbing these costs would be a potential disaster for the project, particularly if we just barely hit our funding goal with a high proportion of international backers.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering if there might be a potential work around. I've thought about doing a very small print run (or print one copy at a time) through a European POD printer, but I'm not sure if that's doable. Another possibility might be partnering with someone in Europe to produce and ship a few copies.  <br/><br/>Has anyone else tried anything like this? Does anyone have any wisdom or suggestions to share?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417885/#Comment_417885" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-06T17:33:59+00:00" title="July  6, 2013  5:33PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cross-Atlantic shipping is a perennial challenge, and will be only more so in the future. (Especially if we get a free trade area covering both Europe and North America <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>) Here are the usual stratagems as a handy list:<br/>1) Print everything in A and ship individually to each customer in B.<br/>2) Print everything in A and ship part of it to a distribution partner in B, who then arranges for continental shipping.<br/>3) Print separately in A and B, off-set or POD all depending on particulars.<br/>4) Print everything in China, ship separately to A and B, have local distribution partners deal with the last leg.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> you've found unfeasible (no wonder, it's expensive just as you said), but numbers 2-4 have all been used successfully. Which is best depends heavily on the particulars. For example, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is how most companies at bigger logistical scales do it - but it's also how I've solved this problem, several times in the past. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is what anybody who uses Lulu to print &amp; fulfill uses, as they achieve reasonable shipping costs by printing on both sides of the Atlantic. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> is used by boardgame publishers and probably others who like to ship directly to the distributor and have a lot to ship.<br/><br/>The ideal schoolbook solution for an American indie wanting to take care of a few dozen customers in Europe might be something like this: find an European game store that orders from IPR, and ask them nicely to distribute your Kickstarter product to the European customers. Arrange with IPR to receive a shipment of your books in Nevada, and then ship them to said retailer alongside their normal order. (This would likely be cheaper than shipping your stuff alone, as a larger shipment is usually cheaper, and the costs could be shared between the two business interests.) Once the books arrive in Europe, it'll be presumably trivial for your partner store to distribute them, as it's something they do anyway if they have a webstore (and who doesn't in this day and age). Figure out a way for your friendly game store to be a beneficiary here as well; if nothing else, at least you'd give them a bunch of copies of your book as thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417915/#Comment_417915" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-07T19:25:58+00:00" title="July  7, 2013  7:25PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is definitely a hard problem, I'm weighing it too for my next project. Eero's solution is definitely one, but it relies on a setup of dominos that you have to "cross your fingers" and hope is in place by the time you are prepared to ship, otherwise you're looking to eat the costs.<br/><br/>I would estimate the charges as best you can, apply them full to international backers. If you can later provide a cheaper shipping plan to Europe and the like, then return that excess cash to the backers directly. Tell them to expect you to try, but that you can't promise anything.<br/><br/>Also, one other option I was thinking was to calculate the shipping of two, four books to Europe. It turns out that with Tenra, for example, it costs about $50 to send to Germany ($50 for one book). But it only costs about $80 to send three books to Germany ($27 for one book). It seems weird, but I was thinking to really push hard that international backers ("Find some friends; save some money").<br/><br/>Perhaps another thing to do would be to keep the PDF price low; then perhaps make a call-out for info on PoD printers in other countries that might be able to handle printing your book locally: "Buying this book, plus paying shipping will cost you $80; but Buying the PDF, then getting it printed in great quality from one of these PoD printers will only cost you about $55; We can't guarantee the quality, of course, but many have spoken highly of work they have done in the past." etc<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417921/#Comment_417921" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-07T23:20:26+00:00" title="July  7, 2013 11:20PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When figuring shipping costs don't forget to include packaging (you'll want really sturdy materials to survive international shipping, especially for hardcovers which are easier to damage than softcovers), handling (unless you're doing that for free and your time is valueless), and Amazon/Kickstarter's 10% cut.

Most Kickstarters are delivering a relatively small number of products (say 500-2000 books), and for International Amazon fulfillment to work and be cheaper they would have to have the product distributed in warehouses across the globe.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417931/#Comment_417931" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-08T05:38:29+00:00" title="July  8, 2013  5:38AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2013 5:41AM by 3Jane.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does anyone know why, considering what they *do* is 'locally' deliver product all over the World, Amazon's link with Kickstarter hasn't progressed to the delivery solution?</blockquote>\nI'd guess being a middleman is more profitable (better work/profit ratio than deliveries).

As an added bonus you could simultaneously supply their warehouse with your game, if you're interested in using them as a sales channel.<br/><br/>I solved the distribution issue with my boxed game in 2008 by printing everything in the USA, travelling myself to the country on the eve of Gencon, collating the boxes in Ron Edwards's basement, and then giving most of them over to IPR at Gencon to ship back to their warehouse while taking a bunch with me back to Europe; visiting Gencon was the actual "excuse" for going to the USA, but being on hand to put the finishing touches to the game provided a nice synergy. Worked well enough, but that's obviously a special snowflake solution of the highest order. A couple years later I bolstered my European supply by arranging for a pallet shipment to be collated at IPR, including my game and a bunch of other stuff I wanted for retail. In our case having the majority of the stock be warehoused in the USA makes sense, as it's easier for us to arrange a pallet shipment from USA to Europe (where we can combine our need to ship this one product with our other hobby of retailing other people's games) than the other way.<br/><br/>(Although, having said that, I should note that if you're shipping freight to the USA from the the Nordic area and have negotiable schedule, nowadays there's the option of joint shipping with Jim Raggi - he's shipping stuff to the USA semi-regularly from Helsinki, as he prints his stuff here. Works well if you're willing to maybe wait for a few months to accord with Jim's schedules.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417940/#Comment_417940" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-08T06:51:40+00:00" title="July  8, 2013  6:51AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>IPR is the obvious suggestion,</blockquote>\nThanks!\n<blockquote>I solved the distribution issue with my boxed game in 2008 by printing everything in the USA, travelling myself to the country on the eve of Gencon, collating the boxes in Ron Edwards's basement,</blockquote>\nI will give him a call then. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatthewJHanson" title="MatthewJHanson"><img alt="MatthewJHanson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatthewJHanson">MatthewJHanson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417941/#Comment_417941" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-08T06:57:15+00:00" title="July  8, 2013  6:57AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a little surprised that you wound up with $50 per item.

It's possible that you can give books to someone who is travelling to Europe or fly them over yourself.<br/><br/>For a long while, it was almost worth my while to fly my books to the States, rather than post them.

It's awesome, but it requires a mountain of overhead from the creator in time and organization (basically, "ship pallets of games to Amazon in three other countries"). It's a solid, step-by-step breakdown:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.stonemaiergames.com/how-to-provide-free-shipping-worldwide-on-kickstarter-a-comprehensive-guide/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.stonemaiergames.com/how-to-provide-free-shipping-worldwide-on-kickstarter-a-comprehensive-guide/</a><br/><br/>Also, there are various reshippers from other countries. For example, USPS no longer offers Sea Mail as an option... but there are other places that do. A friend in New Zealand uses a NZ-specific reshipper service situated in the US when he buys from the US: He sends it to the reshipper, they ship it off to NZ to consolidate and save. Me and my wife use similar services when buying stuff from Japan like books. I imagine that many people are knowledgeable about this: Germans might know German-language-friendly US-to-Germany reshippers, French the same, and so on. It might be good to cast a net, get your fanbase from other countries to help you compile a list, in order to help you save them some money.<br/><br/>"Shipping to the US is Free, shipping overseas is $40; but here are a list of reshippers you may want to consider" or something like that. <br/><br/>You have to be willing to manage/oragnize money, for when people back you at the Intl level, then a few weeks later say "I found a reshipper; please change my addy to X, and refund the difference in money".<br/><br/>But that's still less organizational overhead than managing the shipments of freight and organization to numerous Amazon warehouses...                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
