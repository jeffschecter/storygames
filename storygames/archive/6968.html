Translating to adult-speak, these are my game dice. Her favorite pasttime is taking each die and asking me: "What's that?" I am required to reply with a different food type appropriate to the color of the die. So, the white d20 with black numbers is a chocolate chip cookie. Jadyn: "That's right! Chocolate chip cookie!" My blue dice are blueberries, natch, since there aren't a lot of blue foods. And so on.<br/><br/>Well, in my massive die bag, she managed to find the one D&amp;D plastic promo mini I had, or in her words, a "little man". After much prodding, we took a special trip to B&amp;N and got a booster pack of 8 minis. Jadyn had a lot of fun playing with the "little men". Mostly she introduced them to her other guys, e.g., her stuffed animals, etc. She did a good job remembering the names of the minis. As kids are wont to do, the minis quickly became other people. So, mommy was represented by the eladrin champion; daddy was the goblin picador. Hmmm. The highlight for me was when the troglodyte bonecrusher started doing the hokey-pokey.<br/><br/>[The lawyer in me feels obliged to note that minis and dice are pretty bad playthings for young children. They're CHOKING HAZARDS! Jadyn is well past the oral stage and only plays with my stuff under my direct supervision.]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155203/#Comment_155203" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T08:59:46+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  8:59AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Teddy (also 2.5 years old) has a set of large "practically unswallowable" dice that he rolls and then let's me quiz him on the numbers on the top.
