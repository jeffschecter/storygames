I definitely think there are cases where the idea of making a sale or getting as many copies of your game out there as possible overshadow the best interests of your game and the people who might potentially be interested in it.<br/><br/>For example, Matthijs, the other two ashcans that you bought... what if you had the opportunity to play them right before or after you bought them?  I realize this is probably less applicable to your situation, being across the ocean, but at an event like GenCon, it's certainly possible to plan to run your game at Games On Demand for people who seemed interested in your ashcan, which both 1) creates a stronger sense of investment in the process and gives you time to show what you have and talk about what's missing, and 2) lets interested people learn how to play the game, diminishing the effort and work that you talked about.  I'm going to be offering free copies of Geiger Counter to folks who play the game with me at GenCon for exactly this reason, in an effort to find a different method of ashcan distribution that is more effective at transmitting my intentions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160426/#Comment_160426" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T06:26:17+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  6:26AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>For example, Matthijs, the other two ashcans that you bought... what if you had the opportunity to play them right before or after you bought them?</blockquote>\nWell, if I were playing the games with the designer or someone else who'd read the rules, sure, no problem. That'd be fun, easy, and free.<br/><br/>But to have to read and grok a set of rules which (since they're in ashcan form) <i>might</i> be incomplete, uninspiringly written or hard to understand, and then try to convince other people to join, that feels like work. Nobody is promising me a fun time.

If the designers expected every buyer to play and give feedback, they would print 5 ashcans, not 50.  It's expected that many people, even wanting to playtest the thing, will not be able to do it for some reason. They did contribute anyway, helping to cover the cost of the printings and the stand.<br/><br/>What I think when deciding about buying ashcans is "if I will not be able to play this until the finished game will be published, I will still be happy to have this version of the game to see and compare these stages of development, or I will have wasted my money?". It's a hard question for many games I would have an interest in, so I brought only a single ashcan (that I still have not played)<br/><br/>(a single one from the Ashcan front. I brought and played another ashcan not on the AF because I trusted the designer when he said that the game was already complete and playable - and I played it - but it's a completely different case. As is different the case of various rpg I brought as complete that should have been published as ashcans)<br/><br/>About the "ashcan discussions": I didn't see this supposed "ashcan backlash" people are talking about. Where did happen? The two links cited in this thread are more about that supposed "90% complete" stage than about the ashcan process. From what some people posted, this is what happened:<br/><br/>People published games only 90% complete ---&gt; Matt and Paul created the Ashcan front to push for a return to the old publishing model used by the first Forge games (Sorcerer, Universalis, MLWM, Dust Devils, etc.), instead of the recent "publish as soon as possible" rush, and having a publishing model where 90% complete games are published as such, for playtesting purpose and not commercial consumption --------&gt; people are taking this as an excuse for publishing, as ashcans, games 10% complete and not playable (They say. I have not seen any of those personally, but as I said, I only brought one)<br/><br/>It seems to me the usual "people are too much in an hurry to publish, to be in the 'cool guys' club" problem, applied to the ashcan concept. The problem precede the ashcan, and it's not caused by them (in Big Model terms, it's a social dysfunction, while ashcans are a technique. You can't cure social dysfunctions with a technique)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160433/#Comment_160433" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T07:08:20+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  7:08AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>It seems to me the usual "people are too much in an hurry to publish, to be in the 'cool guys' club" problem, applied to the ashcan concept.

This is why I like this quote from Thor Olavsrud so much: "Pay attention to the process and experience rather than going straight to the product phase". <br/><br/>If you want to make your game good enough to be published, perhaps you must first forget your desire to publish - that might help you focus on working on your game. After all, it will take the time it needs to be done. Then, perhaps, when it is done, you may find you are finished with it and no longer want to publish it.

I don't think a rebate would be a good answer in every case (too complicated to use), but let's see the different cases...<br/><br/>1) "this game work, I am searching for blind playtesters to affine the game text".<br/>What you get when you buy it: a good game that interest you, at a discount, in a "rare advanced edition" (maybe signed by the author?)<br/>Why you should playtest it:  well, if the game interested you in the first place...<br/>Why should you give feedback to the author: Well, probably because you didn't understand the rules...<br/>What you get in return: the author explain to you the rules, and you are able to play the game you brought.<br/>At the end what this gave you that people who brought the final edition didn't get?: Well, maybe the final edition will never arrive, but you already have a playable game. You got to play it before anybody else, and you have a special edition (and you paid less). And a citation in the final book will be nice.<br/>(in case of a pdf edition, you could even get a free pdf of the final game text. The cost of a pdf usually isn't very different from the price of an ashcan. But even if you don't get this, you already have the game)<br/><br/>2) "this game works, but not like I want. I want to get specific effect that this game still don't reliably give"<br/>In this case, you have to be so interested in this game development to want to play the unnfinited (but playable) edition.<br/>The difference with the previous case: it's not enough that the game author give you explanations about the rules. During the playtests he should give you the new rules during the developments (he can't really ask you to buy a chain of different developed ashcans, right?).<br/>What you get for yourself: you can contribute to the finishing touches on the rules, you can play the game (unfinished AND finished when the rules are finalized), you get, piece by piece, the final rules of the game (a final pdf with the complete rules would stil be nice, as a thank-you). The game at this stage should go to blind playtesting with DIFFERENT players (and this would mean publishing a different ashcan...?)<br/><br/>3) "this game is mess, please help me"<br/>I think that nobody would knowingly publish an ashcan like this, but maybe they thought that they were in case (2) and discovered only afterwards that the rules really didn't work reliably.<br/>In this case, I think that as a customer (I am not talking about what the author SHOULD do. there is no "should" in this post, this is what I would DEMAND as a customer) I would like to get (1) a refund, especially if the game author drop the project, or (2) a "help me get a good game from this mess, and I will give you xxxxxx!" request from the author, with xxxx containing AT LEAST a free copy of the final game and a big than-you on the book, and maybe some other quirks (a special numbered edition, a promotional poster, a discount on other games from the same author, I don't know). And I should be able to say "thank you but I would prefer a refund"<br/>(this could be seen as harsh, but I really see refunds as the only thing that will be able to stop this run to publish broken and incomplete games. Something that give "weight" to the choice to don't wait for better playtest, responsibility to people who publish for sale, and anyway you could have published the playtest edition it for free if you were not sure...<br/><br/>As I said, don't take this for a viable proposal, I was thinking out loud and there are probably a lot of holes in what I said. But I think that a refined and more thoughtful version of this would be very useful for both authors and customers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

You should give it lots of consideration. Come talk to us anyway, hear our ideas, walk away with all your money, or with a bit lighter wallet. There are quite a few different products in different stages of done-ness. Some of us are going through this the first time and are unsure of the state of our product, some of us know we have a very specific problem that's troubling us, some of us are whatever. The point is it's marked. You're not grabbing something thinking it's finished and finding it's full of holes. Buying an ashcan may mean it's full of holes, or really tight, but it's clearly marked as not done. Not Done. If that bothers you, it should, but maybe there's something you find that's important enough for you to take a little risk, and hold the motherfucker who made that book accountable. In a positive way, but hold them accountable... I can't speak for everyone, but that's what I'm hoping to find... folks I don't know who burn for what I'm doing. It's not about a normal customer and producer relationship. Sure that relationship is likely to occur, but if that's how you're stepping to the Ashcan Front, or any ashcan, I think you're missing the point. If nothing strikes you in a way that makes you say, "That has to get done!" Then walk away. No one is going to begrudge you for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160449/#Comment_160449" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T09:24:54+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  9:24AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My point, though, is this: Do you want people like me to buy your ashcans, when there's a 95% chance you won't ever get feedback from me?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160450/#Comment_160450" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T09:33:07+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  9:33AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it all comes down to personal choice, really. In the end, that's the only measuring point.<br/><br/>A few years ago (2004?), Mike Miller came out with With Great Power, a preview edition. It was basically a proto-ashcan. It was absolutely fully playable. He was still gathering feedback. And in the end, the game changed in a few ways.  Still, the points are:<br/><br/>1) It was not fully ready.<br/>2) It was fully playable. (and, IMO, fun as fuck. I was sold through private play before the con in like, seriously, 4 minutes)<br/>3) He was hoping for player feedback.<br/>4) The price was $10, with a refund if you purchased the full game when it came out.<br/>5) He made sure that people knew is was a preview edition, yadda yadda.<br/><br/>There was a mildly raging debate back then whether or not this was a good idea.<br/><br/>This debate reminds me very much of that debate. <br/><br/>In both, very little was resolved through discussion.<br/><br/>However, in both, many personal tales were told ("this is why I bought/didn't buy ashcan"), and that information became Data for The Machine.<br/><br/>I hope that, going forward, people can focus less on "getting to the bottom" of whether this enterprise is a good idea or not, and simply share their own viewpoints as to whether they will be participating or not, and why.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160453/#Comment_160453" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T09:49:05+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  9:49AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my data points, to feed to the machine.<br/><br/>* I believe in the ashcan process, because for all the numbers of people who don't have time or intent to leave feedback, it is obvious that there are some who do have the time or intent to leave feedback. It might be 1/10 of what the ashcan creators are hoping for, but I think they're out there, and this provides a good common ground. A service provided to a customer, who is in turn interested in that product. Capitalism: Yay.<br/><br/>* Personally, I am not an ashcan buyer:<br/>-- I bought the With Great Power ashcan, because I was sold on it as a playable game. I had great interest in the subject matter and the rules. So that was a unique situation.<br/><br/>* Last year I bought two ashcans: Acts of Evil and Galactic.<br/>-- I was interested in some of the other games, but not interested enough to buy, read, and give feedback before it was baked. But when it comes out "for realz", I plan on, just like every other product, giving it a look and seeing if I'm interested.<br/>-- Galactic I bought primarily because a good friend worked on it, and it was cheap. I heard that some pieces of it are awesome, and that some pieces are totally fucking broke, and I picked it up anyway. It's a combo of being very interested in the focus of the methodology of the game (the way the play happens), supporting a good friend's art, and giving it a read. Plus, it was like, what, $10? Not much of a commitment, so I was fine with that. I had no intention of playing it.<br/>-- Acts of Evil I got because it sounded fucking awesome, in terms of how it creates those kinds of stories. I actually intended to play it when I bought it.  Unfortunately, the investment time to go through it to understand it (cause it's a very dense game, every paragraph necessary to read and remember, unlike most games where you can skip through "skill lists" and "play advice" and the like to get to the important things) meant that I didn't end up playing it. Therefore, I didn't give feedback. I don't regret the purchase, though, because what little of the game I could keep in my "brain RAM", was really cool and made me think about ways to run other games, even trad games, in the same sort of style that Acts of Evil does.<br/>-- I picked up nothing else, because of a combination of not being interested enough in the setting, the theme, the rules, and knowing that my time the next year would be at a premium.<br/><br/>* This year, I plan on looking over the Ashcan booth thing again. But currently, I have no plans on buying any of them, for the reasons mentioned above. If something catches me off guard, I'll certainly look at it; but I know that from now until probably Spring 2009 I'll be busy with other projects, and playing other games, so I won't be able to give good feedback, or invest the time in learning the game.<br/><br/>* I like it when folks make ashcans downloadable off their websites for free.<br/>-- And I'm very sympathetic to the stories of, "When it was on my website for free, no one said anything; When I started selling ashcans, all of a sudden I was getting feedback from folks".<br/><br/>* The real measure of success, IMO, for this venture is, did the author get the feedback they wanted, and did the player enjoy playing the ashcan?<br/>-- I don't feel a line is needed to be drawn between releasing an ashcan and releasing a full game. Because who knows, someone might have a game that's 90% ready to go, but they find out that that last 10% makes the game entirely unplayable without starting over from scratch; perhaps in time the whole project has to be cast down and scrapped. BUT, if that decision came from seeing the play feedback coming in, then that was a success: The realization that the game wasn't ready, won't be ready, and isn't worth making ready. And the purchaser is out $5 instead of $25, or $30, and perhaps even a friendship forms; a single lotus blossoms in the field, etc.<br/><br/>Thanks for listening to my own viewpoint. I'd like to hear more thoughts, coming from people's own viewpoints.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160456/#Comment_160456" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T10:04:26+00:00" title="August  3, 2008 10:04AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs,<br/><br/>I am possibly in the ashcan phase of development on two separate games. I will not be joining the Ashcan Front for two reasons:<br/><br/>     1. my GenCon attendance is a last-minute decision and still in doubt<br/>     2. I am not sure my games are 90%, having had relatively little playtesting<br/><br/>So with that in mind, I will answer your question for myself. <br/><br/>If I were selling an Ashcan, I would not want you to purchase it given anything like a 95% chance that you wouldn't play it. As I understand the Ashcan model, you'd not be doing me any favors. At best, I would be charging the printing cost of the Ashcan, so you'd defray the costs on a single, cheaply-made book, which would, with the "price" of the work I've put into it, mean I'm selling for a net loss, no matter how you spin it, UNLESS I'm getting the return on the investment I'm looking for: Playtesting. So unless there's about a 70% chance that you'll actually play the game AND get back to me on it, do not buy my theoretical Ashcan. If there's not a 100% chance that you will READ the game and get back to me with your questions and comments, do not buy my theoretical Ashcan. <br/><br/>Also to address Moreno's comments:<br/><br/>If you purchase an Ashcan, I believe you are owed basically nothing. You've made a decision to spend your money on a product, exactly the same as if you'd decided to spend that money on a completed game, or a set of dice, or a miniature. What you are owed is this: The author's active help in understanding and playing his/her game, and feedback on your feedback. If you buy the game and never play it or even read it, then you are owed absolutely nothing. I think you should reasonably expect playtester credits in the finished version of the game and possibly a special thank you if your assistance was above and beyond. Anything beyond that, to include a discount/refund/free copy of the game in .pdf or hardcopy is entirely at the discretion of the author. <br/><br/>Basically, the author is publishing at a loss a product, but the product is not a game, it's an experience and an opportunity: to playtest a game that interests you. If you're not interested in THAT product, then please.. Don't buy my Ashcan (when I have one).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160457/#Comment_160457" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T10:10:35+00:00" title="August  3, 2008 10:10AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2008 10:11AM by JDCorley.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I still want to buy ashcans, but I'm not sure that I should.</blockquote>\nYou should if you want to, and if you don't want to you shouldn't.<br/><br/>Buying things is easy.

Notice that the only case where I talked about a refund was when I talked about a broken, unplayable game, sold like it was playable and only needed a little blind playtesting. This is not a matter of game completeness, it's a matter of truth in advertising)\n<blockquote>What you are owed is this: The author's active help in understanding and playing his/her game, and feedback on your feedback. If you buy the game and never play it or even read it, then you are owed absolutely nothing.</blockquote>\nYes. But notice how this is exactly what I wrote in my post: you write the game author with your questions and feedback, and he (or she) explain to you what you didn't understand, and then you can really play the game. Every "benefit" I talked about in the first two cases is tied to you contacting the author and giving feedback.<br/><br/>It's for this reason, by the way, that I think that free pdfs of the finished product (or other similar benefits) to the people who really helped are a much better incentive than a rebate that anybody could send for a discount. Incentive the feedback, not the buying.\n<blockquote>Basically, the author is publishing at a loss a product, but the product is not a game, it's an experience and an opportunity: to playtest a game that interests you.

For example when I brought that ashcan (Acts of Evil) I was sure that I would have played it as soon as it arrived, but then various problems delayed the end of another campaign more than a month, when the players would not have the free time, and there were other games to try, and now after 3 months I still have to play it and I don't know when I will be able to...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160465/#Comment_160465" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T11:16:09+00:00" title="August  3, 2008 11:16AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs, I promise you a good time with <a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a>.

Determining it's state of completion in percentage. By some people's lights, my games may be that 90% and qualify as ashcans. But given my difficulty in finding gamers of any stripe, let alone those interested in independent games, I've not been able to do a lot of playtesting of my own, and no one's taken me up on playtesting from my .pdfs online. If I'd had more time to plan my GenCon attendance, I may have decided to take a shot at joining the Ashcan Front, judging that my games were *probably* 90%. <br/><br/>I have played them, successfully. I've had a few readers give them an eyeball. The games as they exist in my head are *playable* and have produced fun. Whether or not they can consistently produce that fun without what I bring to the table as the creator, and whether there are any gaping holes right inside my blind-spots is the unknown. The existence of such could push my game from the 90% where I think they're at to a much, much lower number. Hence my stance: You get what you get when you pay for it, and are entitled to no more than what I said in my last post. <br/><br/>This doesn't address someone who sells you a game they know is broken and well below 90% complete. That sort of person isn't being honest about the ashcan process, and probably wouldn't give you a refund anyhow. I don't think there's much point talking about those cases, personally. <br/><br/>So to close and clarify my point about intent: Obviously you can't read the future any more than I can tell you about what's in my blind-spots about my game design. But you can make a judgement based on your current expectations about opportunity, time, and interest to decide whether you really think you're going to play the game. If you think you really are going to play it, then by all means, buy it. If the vagaries of time and circumstance end up preventing you from ever playing it... Well, that's the risk I took when I sold it to you, isn't it?<br/><br/>For final clarification: I am not actually selling an ashcan at GenCon 2008. I'm pretty sure I'll be attending, and I will have one hard-copy each of my two ashcan-worthy games in case I can get in some pick-up games. The above is my stance if I were to be selling, and the stance I'll be assuming if I make any purchases of ashcans while I'm there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

My personal feelings about whether I want someone to buy my Trashcan if they are 95% sure they can't give feedback is varied. <br/><br/>Are you on a shopping spree? Buying several or a bunch? Then no. <br/><br/>Is it the only ashcan you're likely too buy? I bought one ashcan last year and it was Psi-run. I talked to almost everyone there and learned about the games I didn't know about and bought the one I was most interested in that wasn't Acts of Evil, since I had already been involved in playtesting Acts of Evil. I gave them some feedback in the interview we had, but that was previous to my buying their ashcan. So I didn't give them feedback or end up playing the game. It's been a dry gaming year for me, but I don't feel bad about it. Do you burn for my idea but aren't sure you'll have time to give me feedback? Is it a crazy idea that you just have to go back and tell your friends about? An answer of yes to any of the questions in this paragraph, and my answer would also be yes.<br/><br/>Do you think it might be a scam? Then no. Keep yourself safe.<br/><br/>I would also say that you could just wait for the somewhat free version (creative commons, OGL, GPL-artistic, I'm not sure yet) version, but not everyone is going to make the same decision as me, so that might not be an option. To try to engage people at Gen Con I need a physical product that someone pays for... everything else just gets thrown away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Misspent Youth is a fine game with several parts that I consider worth the price of admission (character creation and selling out being 2 examples). I believe the game to be ready for prime time. <br/><br/>This is a question for Rob and anyone who is playtesting their text via Ashcan. How will you receive feedback? Actual Play posts don't seem enough. Maybe you can upload your game text to a site like <a href="http://a.nnotate.com" rel="nofollow">http://a.nnotate.com/</a> and give ashcan testers access to post their feedback directly to the text itself?

Would you, for example, want me to buy your game just because I'm curious, with no real expectation of providing any feedback?</blockquote>\nIf I had an ashcan, which I don't, then my answer would be sure. You are paying for the game, so the cost of printing would be covered, so what do I lose because you bought it? The chance of that copy being bought by someone else who would give me feedback? Well sure, but I'd have plenty of copies and lots of people won't give me feedback. There isn't really a vast pool of eager testers gagging to give me feedback, if there were I probably wouldn't need the Ashcan.<br/><br/>Selling an Ashcan just involves the same risks as selling any game.

Matthijs, to answer your question, absolutely I would want you to buy my game.  I can't deny there is an attraction that you felt it worth giving me money.  Secondly, I don't know the way you and your group works, but you might, at some point, decide to pick it up and play.  Especially given that <i>Messiah</i> is designed to be played in a like 2 hours tops.  Honestly, I look at the game as that thing you pick up and play when a player in your regular game calls in sick or you just don't feel like prepping for that session.<br/><br/>Also, I don't know if I am doing the Ashcan Front wrong, but I would never, ever sell a game I didn't think was fun or that I thought was broken.  I have worked hard to desgin a game that was fun to play and a text that was approachable.  When you plunk down your $10, I want you to walk away with a game that you will end up thinking is worth it.  At the end, there are a few questions, but frankly, if you don't answer them, I would not be crushed.

I also keep seeing this number 10 preceded by a dollar sign being thrown around, which is also confusing to me, as I was under the impression that ashcans were normally sold at print cost and no more.<br/><br/>Hence, the book you buy is not the product you're paying for. It's the opportunity to playtest a game that you believe, or have been convinced, has a lot of promise for awesome play that you are paying for. If you don't believe that is something you should pay for, then don't. <br/><br/>That said, I can understand the allure of owning a physical artifact of the development process. If Ralph Mazza is selling Blood Red Sands ashcans at GenCon, I'll probably be incredibly tempted to pick one up, even though I've got the rules text already, and haven't managed to get even a single-session playtest going in the months since I acquired the rules text. But if I do buy it, it will be with the explicit (on my part) understanding that I WILL playtest it if an opportunity ever presents itself, and I will make an attempt to make my own opportunities to do so. Then I will tell Ralph all about it until he says enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160659/#Comment_160659" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T14:05:07+00:00" title="August  4, 2008  2:05PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            with the ashcan front, I thought the going rate was $10.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160666/#Comment_160666" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T14:28:00+00:00" title="August  4, 2008  2:28PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ashcans have no set price. They operate under the same concept as any other creator-owned game. A designer decides how much he or she will sell the thing for. Prices tend to be between, I dunno, $8 and $15.<br/><br/>Relatively few recent ashcans provide a discount for people who purchase and interact with early ashcan editions. Again, it's up to each designer to do so. I did not take that approach with my ashcan game 44, for example.<br/><br/>Matthijs, you're being slightly masochistic! I mean that in good humor. Certainly, I as an ashcan front creator and as a proponent/founder of the Ashcan Front <i>want</i> you to engage with the design of a game. We <i>want</i> you to support the game and become the designers peer and communicate. We do not <i>expect</i> it. Nor do we scorn you if you 1) buy and don't feedback or 2) don't buy at all. Totally your option.<br/><br/>I sold something like 20+ ashcans of 44 last year. I sure as heck didn't get 20 groups' feedback in return. I did not expect to. I received relatlively little feedback. This I expected.<br/><br/>Also, it's been less than a year-to-date since the Ashcan Front even existed. Kevin Allen Jr. will release the first "graduate" at the Design Matters booth in his game Sweet Agatha. To the best of my knowledge, no one else has "finished" an ashcan game. In fact, I'm not sure anyone has completed an ashcan (as in, a regular ol' "rough draft" game that was NOT part of the Ashcan Front) in the last year or so anyway. Probably there were a couple I'm forgetting.<br/><br/>I sense some hint that this is sorta bad. Again, it's well within both mine and Paul's expectations. Paul and I have specifically communicated that we never expected any games to be finished by this year. We expect that these games will meet two likely fates: <br/><br/>1) The game will never be realized. Ryan Macklin has already announced this to be the case for his ashcan from last year, for example.<br/><br/>2) The game will be "slow cooked" and released as a solid product in 1-2 years, perhaps more. My own game 44 will be published by the end of the year, for example.<br/><br/>There are, of course, other options. But, we saw these as the most likely results. Importantly, I consider option <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> totally viable and a good sign that ashcans as a concept do what I, at least, would like them to do.<br/><br/>Finally, I really like that there is conversation with many viewpoints going on about this. I like that because about 1-2 years ago no such conversation existed. As far as Paul Czege and I are concerned: Mission Accomplished. We wanted to make known to the creator-owned RPG scene that ashcan is one viable <i>option</i> that will help solve specific problems of designing and publishing your game. It is clear to me now that this is indeed viewed as a viable option. Fantastic! <br/><br/>Does it mean it's good for everyone? Of course not. Does it mean it has its own flaws? Of course not. But, we think the good outweighs the bad. This has been a good thing for the hobby, as far as I can see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160698/#Comment_160698" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T18:09:51+00:00" title="August  4, 2008  6:09PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.
