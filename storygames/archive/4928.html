I had an argument last night and it left me a little shaken. So, yeah, I'm pretty angry about it and even more angry that i let my temper get the best of me and couldn't make a rational argument. Actually i'm even more angry that I then let my need to not be seen as a dick make me back down on something I really believe in. Does that sound wierd?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway. here goes a little rant. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if I'm not willing to come up with a business plan and sink my savings into a publishing company i might as well not bother? I have to risk my livlihood to be taken seriously? I'm a bad person who's diluting the market with crap if i'm not going to suck some industry guy's dick for a writing gig? Wanting to write a game as a hobby and just break even and be pleasantly surprised when I get some beer and con money is a spurious way to go about it? I'm not serious unless I take a huge financial risk to start a company and hope I get everything right and hope no one i work with drops the ball so I don't go bankrupt? or else i'm not serious if I don't bust my ass to sell myself to someone with money so i can either write their game or write my game with them looking over my shoulder?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd small games are diluting the market?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow exactly does a self produced game dilute the market? how does the tiny percent of a percent that my game might make really threaten the big guys? Especally when the people buying probably wouldn't buy their product anyway because they're fed up with it?<br/>\n<br/>\nSuffice to say my buttons were pressed.

If its a market, games are worth what people will pay for them. Prices are established by buyers and sellers coming to a negotiated price. If some blowhard can't get what they want for their game because hobbyists are out their selling at a loss, I understand their disappointment, but their business model is flawed. They want to apply consumer culture to the hobby game market, but they don't have enough product differentiation to charge the premium they want. <br/><br/>As an aside, does community theater dilute the market for Broadway musicals?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110526/#Comment_110526" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T23:12:48+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 11:12PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take all the people who tell you those things, and fuck roughly them in the ear.<br/><br/>After that, you'll both be more relaxed, and can discuss these things civilly.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arphid" title="arphid"><img alt="arphid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.students.uwf.edu/mte2/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arphid">arphid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110529/#Comment_110529" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T23:22:04+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 11:22PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, the anger dollar.

He's clinging to a structure that's being shaken by change and adaptation. It's a bad place to be, but it's not your fault that people are interested in exploring something new and different (those people being both you and potential consumers).<br/><br/>But, if the person's opinion matters, especially if they're a friend, then that's rough to hear. I'm sorry that you've been put in a place where you need to choose between your personal strengths and your interpersonal allegiances. Being told by a friend that you're sabotaging a mutual passion is a rough, shitty thing to hear (regardless of whether it's true or absolutely false). My suggestion is to think about where they're coming from, and what the resentment is really targeted toward. Shift blame into exploration, and ask him if he's willing to take a step back and look at how your publishing hobbies co-exist and how they can co-evolve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110550/#Comment_110550" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T04:15:47+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  4:15AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>And small games are diluting the market?</blockquote>\nGod bless capitalism and its ability to provide ever more affordable and diverse products to the consumer. <br/><br/>That guy you had an argument with is RIAA, and you are Web 2.0.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110554/#Comment_110554" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T04:25:56+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  4:25AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a bunch of arse.<br/><br/>There's a funny thing about the gaming market.

No for your output, yes for your pronouncements on game design and development as a professional field.\n<blockquote><br/>I'm a bad person who's diluting the market with crap if i'm not going to suck some industry guy's dick for a writing gig? </blockquote>\nNo. Then again, equating a well-written submission with knob-gobbling is kind of screwy.\n<blockquote>Wanting to write a game as a hobby and just break even and be pleasantly surprised when I get some beer and con money is a spurious way to go about it?</blockquote>\nNo. Working at an effective loss and claiming you've succeeded because you can suck some money out of the till and the end of each day at the con and pay for hot dogs and beer, then claiming great financial success that will show the Man what for is somewhat dickish, however.\n<blockquote>I'm not serious unless I take a huge financial risk to start a company and hope I get everything right and hope no one i work with drops the ball so I don't go bankrupt?</blockquote>\nNo, you don't need to take big risks. You should, however, either pay anyone you work with a worthwhile rate for their labour flat, or offer them a share of the profits for proportional risk, but proportional reward. You should not abuse friendship and denigrate the value of labour to get people do do stuff for you cheaply, because it's unethical.\n<blockquote> or else i'm not serious if I don't bust my ass to sell myself to someone with money so i can either write their game or write my game with them looking over my shoulder?</blockquote>\nAs a general rule, nobody's interested in publishing your game except for you, so <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> will never happen. I will look over your shoulder for you for a small fee, as I did for Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries. You can ask Eric Boyd about that process. You should, however, bust your ass, since that increases the probability of producing anything worth buying.\n<blockquote>And small games are diluting the market?<br/></blockquote>\nIf they're ill-conceived, yes. \n<blockquote>How exactly does a self produced game dilute the market?</blockquote>\nBy burying small press games that should stand out within an ever increasing number of entries that attach to press release feeds, blog aggregations, searches and e-commerce indices. Good small games do not emit telepathic quality rays that direct consumers to the right place, and promotional efforts shouldn't be the sole avenue for sales. It's important to accommodate casual browsers, people looking to round out a multiple product order, etc. There's nothing wrong with adding *good* work to that mass, but crappy stuff is a problem. Taste is subjective, but there are well-defined steps you can take to ensure that your game is not unbearably lousy.\n<blockquote>how does the tiny percent of a percent that my game might make really threaten the big guys?</blockquote>\nIt doesn't. It threatens other small guys. Big guys have their own dedicated categories/information streams and don't have this problem.\n<blockquote>Especally when the people buying probably wouldn't buy their product anyway because they're fed up with it?</blockquote>\nThey're not, as a rule. People have diverse tastes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110580/#Comment_110580" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T05:45:08+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  5:45AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: T-Boy</cite>Because, you know, just because the whole industry trainwrecks doesn't mean that it's the end of roleplaying as a hobby.</blockquote>\nToo true.

Meaning that there are less fans for each specific game line and more people who are fans of games -- in general -- who buy things here and there but don't subscribe to entire game lines?  Meaning that individual products are selling fewer copies as the same purchasing dollars are distributed among more and more creators, since the audience isn't expanding at the same rate as new games are being published?  So... we're all small scale hobby publishers.  Um... great.<br/><br/>Malcolm's point that "good" indie games compete with "bad" indie games for fans and dollars... I don't really know how to make that determination and never have.  But indie publishing is not something that is -- or should be -- limited to a certain kind of product, especially one that meets an arbitrary standard like "good."  Indie publishing is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign" rel="nofollow">Hundred Flowers Blooming</a> environment.  You're gonna like some stuff and not like other stuff.  That's just the nature of things.  And, yeah, sometimes you have to work to be noticed and sometimes great games, for whatever reason, don't get a whole lot of attention.  But perseverance matters and I think, perhaps naively, that if your game regularly delivers a great play experience... people will find it, especially if you're demoing it at cons and playing with with other creators who will spread the word about the awesomeness of your product.  Actively sharing your game through organizing play of it is pretty much a surefire way of showing people what it does and getting others excited about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110594/#Comment_110594" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T06:46:11+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  6:46AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone who says anything about the RPG market doesn't know what they're talking about because nobody who knows anything about it has been paid a lot of money to study it for a long time.<br/><br/>There are some surveys out there but they don't tell you much other than "people like D&amp;D", which is not worthless, of course.<br/><br/>If you want to make a game, make a game.<br/><br/>I agree that if you don't write a business plan, you are wasting everyone's time, including your own.

There are negative people in every industry and hobby - ignore them, unless it actually sounds like they are imparting valuable knowledge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110640/#Comment_110640" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T08:51:50+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  8:51AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christian, right on. <br/><br/>The idea that indie publishers are making <i>unethical</i> decisions by not paying actual living wages to creators is just silly. It It's entitlement crap. I don't owe anybody the "right" to make a living creating gaming stuff. I don't owe it to anyone who <i>chooses</i> to eek out a living in the RPG industry to back off my financial decisions so they can buy ramen. Fuck them right in the ear, since there's a lot of that going around. (This is like safe sex on Family Guy!)<br/><br/>Also, the idea that indie products might "dilute" the industry is just pitiful. Jesus Jump Up Christ, could there be any louder sign that things are fucked up in the industry? I mean, holy crap, you can't compete with John Q Nerd's Lulu Extravaganza to the point it's "diluting" your market?

(But that makes some of us feel cool, I have to admit, myself included.)  All it is is some idea, some plan for "what am I doing, how long is it taking me, what are my milestones, where and in what form will I distribute it, how much will I ask for it, and what will I do with the money". It's just a tiny bit more than a household budget.  And putting it in writing will keep you from floundering around and wasting your own time. What, just because you're a hobbyist, you have infinite time to flounder around in your own urine? Hell no, you want something to make your hobby work. And you have to plan that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110648/#Comment_110648" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T09:08:20+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  9:08AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>Recommended business plan for DIY games. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is crucial.<br/><br/>1. start writing game.<br/>2. continue working at lucrative day job.<br/>3. finish writing game.<br/>4. playtest game.<br/>5.

Figure out your budget for art, layout, and other services that you feel you need other people to do. <br/><br/>1.a. Make it an amount you can bear to lose completely if things go to hell.<br/><br/>2. Figure out from that what profit margin you want to have in order to recoup your investment in x copies sold.  Add a couple of review copies as additional expenses there, if you want. Set the price of your product appropriately.<br/><br/>3. Put the thing up on Lulu, and/or as PDF on rpgnow.com. Watch it make back your investment over time.<br/><br/>4. To speed things up, send out review copies, run some demos, talk about your game online (you're passionate about it anyway, right?).<br/><br/>That's it. After some time, if you keep making a sale here and there, your investment will be recouped. You could have print runs and join IPR or other places, but that would severely raise the initial investment, so if you're doing this to get your game out and just get your investment back, you need to figure out if that extra expense still complies with 1.a.<br/><br/>ETA: Of course, this omits all of the "make and playtest the game" stuff that Matt W. already listed.

Figure out which one you want.    You don't have to be one to be the other.   Ask yourself this:  if your core desire is to put a game out that people will enjoy, then why does *selling it* matter to you?    If the publishing part of it is your focus, then why not actually be professional about it?  (And yes, that means investment, a business plan, etc.)<br/><br/>To directly address Mr. Corley:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Anyone who says anything about the RPG market doesn't know what they're talking about because nobody who knows anything about it has been paid a lot of money to study it for a long time.</blockquote>\nPatentedly false, and oft-repeated by amateurs who want to feel better about themselves.   Sorry, but that's the truth.<br/><br/>I've worked in this industry since 1989.   I've also been paid as a business consultant within it....and there are people in the business with even more experience and more industry-related marketing cred than me.     Like it or not, there are people who know things that you don't.     Dismissing that is simple arrogance, and serves no purpose other than to make people who don't know the ins-and-outs of the business feel like they're not missing anything critical.       Unfortunately, that's bullshit -- and the history of this business is littered with wise-asses who thought that "nobody knows anything about it" and that they had as good a shot as anyone else.<br/><br/>Game Design is game design -- and the self-defined "Indie" folks have, in many cases, proven their talents in those regards.  But publishing is not game design, and the majority of indie publishers.....well, they make great game designers.   (There are exceptions, obviously).<br/><br/>Small games *do* dilute the market.   It's a simple fact.    However, if you're a good publisher, you don't really worry about the dilution, because you concentrate on a Long Tail strategy, and brand-building.     But you can't deny the facts -- more stuff (both good and bad) means that each bit of stuff has to work harder to find an audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110707/#Comment_110707" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T12:21:36+00:00" title="November 30, 2007 12:21PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2007 12:28PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The plural of anecdote is not data, so I am still right.  A comprehensive analysis of the RPG market would not just be the "accumulated wisdom of experience" because then two people with identical experience could have very different analyses based on whether they are smart or stupid. (Or, you know, that they just had different perceptions, but what are the odds that one wouldn't be stupider than the other?!)<br/><br/>A substantive analysis would have numbers in it, and margins of error, and confidence intervals, and it would be peer-reviewed, and expensive.<br/><br/>Maybe saying that <i>nothing</i> is known was too extreme. I'll cop to that.<br/><br/>Edit: And WTF, how does saying "nobody knows anything substantive" lead to "therefore you have as good a shot as anyone?" I think it would lead to the opposite conclusion, that the further you stray from established successes, the more risk you're taking.

They're big, right?   Big = far easier to notice, kinda by definition.....    [EDIT] To make it even more clear -- what I'm saying here is that in the "small game" end of the pool, the dilution has a much more critical negative effect, simply by virtue of the fact (to state it in the abstract) that it's hard to pick out 1 small thing from a field of 10,000 small things....but if you add 1 big thing to a field of 10 big things, you can still differentiate fairly easily.

Cause that's... not really saying much.<br/><br/>If the distinction is <em>good</em> games versus <em>bad</em> games, as the connotation certainly implies, then the statement would be saying "the introduction of more small games decreases the ratio of good games to bad games" and would carry a conclusion (or assumption) that the ratio of good to bad is lower in small games than it is in big games.<br/><br/>If the distinction is <em>my games</em> versus <em>everybody else's games</em>, which I think is what most folks who espouse the line are bitching about, the statement is "the introduction of more small games decreases the visibility of my games."  To which the response is: "Yes.  Maybe you should do something about that and differentiate your product."<br/><br/>Markets are not sacred things that must be protected and nurtured.  The gaming market is not some holy relic that we all as good gamers ought to maintain the purity of.  The gaming market will be just fine with or without your or my participation in it.

That's the first step.    <br/><br/>Keep in mind though, that the sort 'wisdom' you're talking about is a commodity that is worth paying for -- and I fully admit that I'm saying that as a paid consultant.   But I'd be saying it even if I wasn't.  If I was starting, for example, a company that produces gadgets, I wouldn't expect to get free advice from someone with extensive experience in the gadget market  -- and really, the rules shouldn't change just because we're "only" talking about games.<br/><br/>So, yeah -- Ask.    Generally speaking, you can probably expect a little bit of freebie advice, just on fellow-gamer goodwill alone.   But to really pick someone's brain, you should be willing to pay them.<br/><br/>In my experience, though -- the ones that are most in need of the help are the ones least likely to want to pay for it.   *Shrug*  It is what it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110734/#Comment_110734" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T13:33:02+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  1:33PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Otherwise, gamer money at Gen Con could very well be going into the 3 for 1 remainder bins rather than into the hands of hard-working game designers...I mean publishers...I mean designers.</blockquote>\nWell, to be honest, the stuff in that booth was mostly crap anyway.

Being a publisher means running a business. It means creating a business plan, designing a website, coordinating art, editing, and layout, marketing the product, keeping finances in order, hiring and liaison with freelancers, coordinating distribution (whether you're talking about three-tier or direct), and so on. What it leaves little time for is actually designing games.<br/><br/>It seems to me that a lot of gamers conflate the designing-a-game side of things with the publishing-a-game side of things....but I doubt any of them have said to themselves "Oh boy!

Our complete game, as Lisa and I envisioned it, needed art. It also needed good layout and editing to be fully realized. I had already put the rules up on the Forge, so if anyone wanted to, they could play the game for free. And now we've got a demo that gives away all of the conflict resolution rules.<br/><br/>But the final game, with art and the beast tattoos, is bigger than just the text.<br/><br/>The publishing goal, therefore, was to make back the money for the art and layout so that we could afford to possibly do the same thing again next time around.<br/><br/>If I believed that art and layout didn't add anything to a game and that it's all just about the rules, I'd have put it out for free. But I don't. I'm happy we went the way we did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110771/#Comment_110771" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T14:38:55+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  2:38PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2007 2:41PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll give you my answer:  Because I'm interested in learning more about the publishing side of things, so I'm dabbling in it.  I'm treating running a business as a hobby &amp; expierment, not a livelihood.  I deserve something for my efforts, sure, but for me that's not money from others -- it's satisfaction from myself.  And if people don't like that that's my intent, I'll happily not sell to them pure and simple.  Hell, my first book is something 100% for charity and I'm giving refunds to those who bought my ashcan (though I should probably post about that), so I'm really not in it for the money.<br/><br/>As for the "Fuck 'em in the ear" comment, the way I say it wasn't "Put your game out there!" but "Don't let someone else berate you and devalue you" like the OP talked about.  Maybe Ben, who said that phrase in this thread, saw it as different, but there you go.<br/><br/>I will say that a lot of people confuse "publishing" with "producing a physical product and asking money for it," and we as a community pay lip service to that but don't stress it enough.  "Publishing" can also mean making a PDF and putting it on a website for free, or printing up rules, stapling them together and handing them out to friends.  Hell, at this point I think I'm going to look more into that for some of my more obscure projects, because I don't want to go through the effort of selling them.  If that's still "diluting" a market, fuck it; if free content on the Internet threatens a product or dilutes a market, that product or market is unworthy of existence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110774/#Comment_110774" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T14:45:30+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  2:45PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>I will say that a lot of people confuse "publishing" with "producing a physical product and asking money for it," and we as a community pay lip service to that but don't stress it enough.

Fuck them right in the ear, since there's a lot of that going around. (This is like safe sex on Family Guy!)<br/><br/>Also, the idea that indie products might "dilute" the industry is just pitiful. Jesus Jump Up Christ, could there be any louder sign that things are fucked up in the industry? I mean, holy crap, you can't compete with John Q Nerd's Lulu Extravaganza to the point it's "diluting" your market? The mind reels.</blockquote>\n1) It sure is entitlement. I think artists and writers and other workers are entitled to make decent money and that wrapping yourself in a small press/"indie" flag to justify ripping workers off is pathetic. If you are a publisher, the risk of making nothing is yours. If you want to share that risk, then morality compels you to share the rewards, too. But you think it's just fine to pay people shit and then give them nothing if *you* make good bank out of it.<br/><br/>That's called exploitation. Indulging in it makes you an unethical shitheel, and nobody should buy anything produced by an unethical shitheel.<br/><br/>2) There is no difference between good and bad products on an electronic storefront. None.<br/><br/>So, we all do this.

Nobody is forcing artists to work for low pay. They choose to do the work. They choose to make their living the way they want to, and they choose their projects. If we put them in a position where they had no choice about it, it would be our responsibility. But we are not.<br/><br/>2. Actually, thanks to indie publishers, there are MORE jobs for artists out there in the RPG field than ever before. Joanna Barnum, who did the art for Beast Hunters, would probably have never been hired by a large RPG publisher; her style is not typical-RPG-enough. Plus, if she would have been, our work for her would STILL have been ADDITIONAL work--she could have done our work AND Wizard of the Coasts, or chosen not to do ours if Wizard keeps her busy enough. The pure idea that we're forcing poorly-paid jobs on artists because we are offering ADDITIONAL opportunities is utterly nonsensical. We are not in any position to rival a big publisher to the degree that we decrease the art they commission; that would be a preposterous suggestion, given our tiny market share. Every indie project is an ADDITIONAL opportunity for artists that they can feel free to accept or refust.<br/><br/>3. Also, we paid Joanna exactly what she asked for in her very first proposal. We didn't even haggle. I think this is true for may indie publishers.<br/><br/>4. There is an identifiable difference for customers between good and bad products on electronic storefronts: reviews, branding, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110797/#Comment_110797" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T15:22:35+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  3:22PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>Here's the part where I come in, say some stuff which is true, and piss a bunch of people off.</blockquote>\nYou know, I'm pretty sure it's possible to make the exact same points without pissing people off.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>What I have yet to hear from anyone in the "fuck 'em in the ear!

Having a shiny perfect-bound game book is neat, even if it comes from lulu.<br/>2. Participating in a booth and running demos at a con sounds like it could be fun.<br/>3. With rare exceptions (e.g., Risus) people seem to be much more likely to actually <i>play</i> a game that they actually bought, rather than one that was a free download.<br/>4.

credibility. I said as much in my post. I said, specifically, that you and Malcolm have things to contribute here. <br/><br/>But, you (and Malcolm, just as frequently) just have no clue that you just do not treat people here as your colleagues. You treat them as amateurs to your professional status. You treat them as business enemies, frequently. That's the meat of my post, which you're silent on so far. Like I said, you're defensive. I even appreciate that and why I think that is. You can find that insulting. I don't care.<br/><br/>You should try to talk with people on the level. Instead, you fucking freak out ... again. For, what, the third, fourth time since GenCon? It's predictable. Oh, here comes Gareth. Wonder how long this will take to devolve. Today? Fewer than four hours. Malcolm does the same fucking thing.<br/><br/>Just talk to people. Start a conversation. Acknowledge other people's points and position. Share cool ideas. Stop treating the forum like your alternative ego-stroking and marketing blog for your next project, and stop treating people like ignorant fools to whom you need to reveal publishing Scripture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110819/#Comment_110819" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T16:00:24+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  4:00PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt--<br/><br/>I *have* been talking to folks --- like Judd, for example.

It goes like this. First, you do actually do act like an asshole. Next, someone, like me, calls you on it. Things heat up. Finally, you remain silent about the actual points you're called out on and instead point at some other things you are doing that are far less asshole-like. You then reply with "I'm a big boy adult, see (pointing)? <i>You started it poopyhead!</i>"<br/><br/>And, then you walk away from the conversation without guilt or blame, and quite sure you've been assailed by irrational fools, and that the person who called you on it is an asshole or out to get you or whatever.<br/><br/>I view this as your modus operandi, particuarly here on Story-Games because I earnestly believe you've done this many times. <br/><br/>Which, whatever, then I'm just still an asshole. I really don't care what you think of me. You've proven yourself such a agressive jerk so often over the years that I have very little respect for your social ability and friendliness, in person as well as online. I certainly don't care what someone who has lost my respect by their own action thinks of me.<br/><br/>Something remains, though -- the perception in communities like this one that you do this, and people remember that shit. And, the next time your posts rolls around, they're thinking "Hoo boy, here's Gareth again, so rev up your engines folks. Sigh."<br/><br/>I am saying, as I have been saying previously, that you do not accept your culpability. Hence the "treat me bad" card line.

This is something I'm working to do less of.<br/><br/>But, frankly, Gareth asked for a question in general, and when I gave him my answer he devalued my experience with his beliefs stated as facts and put himself as someone who is higher status than me in this conversation.  Has he given me any reason to continue a discussion with him when he just shuts down my contribution to the thread without showing any care to think about what I'm saying?  Probably not.  Why should I value what you have to say when you actively exclude my experiences?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite><b>You're</b> the one coming in here, making assumptions and insults and generally acting like a fucking asshole.

It's a true story, it's about me.<br/><br/>Let's see. It's Christmas of 2000. I'm an avid RPG player (I mean it, seriously, AVID) but I haven't bought a game book since ... two three years I think? Most of my games have come from used book stores, anyway. I'm not in touch with the market. I don't go to cons, I don't read about games online, I'm not in any way tied to the greater community.<br/><br/>A friend of mine buys me a new game for Christmas. (Game will not be mentioned publically). I'm like "holy shit, NEW role-playing game?" I barely knew that they still made those. The color is really cool, too. It's super-exciting. I get very jazzed up about it and decide I'm going to run a one-shot on New Year's Eve. I pre-generate the characters to my player's specifications, I make a whole little scenario that showcases the cool setting without needing the players to know the world background, I do the whole shebang.<br/><br/>New year's eve: We're playing, we're having fun, everything is great. Then ... we use the system to resolve something. Eh. It's flat and unexciting. Okay, whatever, we roll over it and keep playing and it's a good game. Then we come to a place where we need to use the extended conflict system ... and ... it doesn't work. Not as in "it doesn't give good results" it doesn't <i>work</i>. I did a back of the envelope calculation and figured out that it would have taken nearly 1000 repetitions of the resolution for it to have a decent chance of resolving. It's clear, abundantly clear, that this was never playtested. Not "never blind playtested." Not "never played in the context of a real game." But simply "the guy who wrote it never even sat down to try it out, and that was abundantly clear as soon as we did."<br/><br/>We ended up handwaving it ... but the rest of the game was just ... flat. We spent the whole time avoiding conflict and danger because we didn't want to have to think about using that system anymore. Yuck.<br/><br/>The whole experience soured me on new games. Why should I pay money for someone else's unplaytested crap? I mean, seriously, they clearly didn't even have the simplest concepts of game design, whereas I had a pretty together head about most of these things. I didn't buy any new games until Riddle of Steel in ... late 2002?<br/><br/>If the game had been good, fun, exciting, I imagine I would have been buying a lot more games. It soured me on the <i>concept</i> of new role-playing games, and it wasn't until much later that I decided to give it a shot again.<br/><br/>So there's something to that. The market can get diluted and flooded and even deflated with bad games.<br/><br/>Which is totally different from "games that you bet your life savings on." The game in question was produced in large quantities and sold through distribution. I would put Polaris up against that game in terms of making customers excited any day of the week.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110865/#Comment_110865" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T17:20:07+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  5:20PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

If it wasn't for POD I would have to pay for a small print run (of, what, maybe 500?) out of my own pocket before I saw even a cent and then pay through the nose mailing all my stuff out of Korea. It would be completely unworkable. If it weren't for POD I'd be MUCH better off doing to a publisher and just taking whever they give me.<br><br>With POD its a whole other ball game. I can do layout since its something that I want to learn how to do anyway for my day job (curriculum development) and my co-author can do the art so we don't have to spend a dime. All we have to do is stick the thing on Lulu and there's zero risk and any money we get is pure profit. Zero risk money is always nice, even if there's not much of it.<br/><br/>Of course factoring in opportunity costs the time we sink into this will surely make us less than minimum wage, but its fun so so what?<br/><br/>Of course because of POD/PDFs there's a MASSIVE explositon of crappy RPGs (FATAL etc.) since there's no real filtering mechanism to keep that crap out that's built into the publishing system. But then to figure out which games are good I can just post "sell me on X" here or on rpg.net and get a pretty good idea if the same is decent or not. I find that "people on rpg.net like it" is a much better (although far from perfect) way of finding good games than "X publishing house published it."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110896/#Comment_110896" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T20:18:14+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  8:18PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, here I am to throw in my two cents.  I finally have a minute to come here and read enough of any given thread to comment intelligently.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, disclaimer:  I am married to Ogre, however if you think this means I will blindly support and agree with him, you have very obviously never met me/us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the problem here is that Ogre and I come from a very "punk rock" DIY sensibility, where if you're doing something solely for money, that makes it less pure to us.  It's why when I went back to grad school after doing IT for two years, it was for Russian History and not Computer Science.  Yeah, I'd be making a fuck of a lot more money with a CS degree, hell, I might even be working in my field with a CS degree, but that just feels dirty to me, because I don't love it.  I do computer shit because it makes me money and I'm good at it, not because I'm particularly interested in it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for not paying artists "industry standard," this is how it goes:  I ask and tell them what I can/am willing to pay them.  Either they say yes or they say no.  I'm not standing over anyone in an Ilsa She-Wolf of the SS costume beating them with a riding crop yelling, "Draw faster, swine!!!  You will draw for what I offer you!!"  Hell, with our circle of friends, most of the artists we know are more than willing to draw shit for us for dinner and a blow job, because the project sounds like fun or sounds interesting to them and because they love to draw/paint/whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, speaking of industry standard, how do you feel about Dragon magazine's policies on buying fiction?  Less than half the "industry standard" per word (as compared with other sci fi magazines/journals of comparable "cred"), plus you sign over your rights in perpetuity.  No one else does that.  That doesn't sound very fair, but people are still submitting because they want the publishing credit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, no one has a "moral" obligation to put out a good product.  For Heaven's sake, have you not looked at the movie ads for the last two decades.  Good Lord, while I loved "Night of the Comet" in the 80s, it sure wasn't good.

I must be doing an awful job of explaining....well, anything.<br/><br/>Again, you're asking for a HUGE response.   If you want a generalized answer (which would be so generalized as to be pretty much useless as advice), it is this:  Amateurs get into publishing without understanding everything that running a publishing business entails.   They end up being tripped up by any number of a thousand different things that they can get wrong, and often end up with a project that they sunk money into, which they lost money on, and which nobody remembers.  In the end, all they did was clutter the market, making it harder for other folks just like them (who did the same thing, with the same result, etc. -- leading to a big vicious cycle.).<br/><br/>My statement that you quoted was a <i>very specific</i> response to a claim (made by JDCorely) that "anyone who says anything about the RPG market doesn't know what they're talking about", which is <i>extremely</i> wrong.   So, I pointed out that it was wrong, and why dismissing that was arrogance.   I don't know how much more specific that needs to be.<br/><br/>From what it looks like from here, you're asking me to tell you what mistakes are being made, specifically.   I can't tell you that, because it's not that simple.   Publisher A might not understand how to base his products' price correctly, and end up taking a loss on production because he didn't take hidden costs into account.   Publisher B might not understand how distribution works, and ends up being taken advantage of by a less-than-ethical fulfillment house.   Publisher C might produce his game in a format that has him making a certain amount of money at a certain level of popularity, but which ends up *losing* him money if he has to start shipping in higher numbers if it gets popular....there are thousands of different stories, and it all comes down to not understanding the business.<br/><br/>I hope that I'm making myself clear enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/charlequin" title="charlequin"><img alt="charlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/charlequin">charlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110936/#Comment_110936" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T12:30:43+00:00" title="December  1, 2007 12:30PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>So there's something to that.

And I think (certainly I hope) Malcolm would agree that it doesn't <i>inherently</i> have anything to do with small vs. big games. TSR diluted the market with shitty D&amp;D products and drove their company to collapse; publishers with stars in their eyes diluted the market with shitty d20 products and sank the market for everyone.<br/><br/>I do think that everytime someone publishes a game that isn't edited, isn't playtested, is pug-fugly, whatever, it hurts almost every other small independent game -- not <i>Dogs</i> or <i>Polaris</i>, but all the games that are good and worth buying but <i>don't</i> get the exposure of being in the indie scene's top 5. If the scene wants to be self-sustaining and to help everyone who can write a good game succeed, it should work to discourage the publication of lousy games.<br/><br/>The same way, it doesn't reflect well on the scene that there's so little accessible advice about how to ethically employ people for the services your game needs but you can't provide yourself.  I don't think that most people who have published their own games and post to SG have taken advantage of artists and editors -- but my perception is that, a lot of the time, the tossed off advice is "get your friends to do it for free!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110937/#Comment_110937" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T12:39:21+00:00" title="December  1, 2007 12:39PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: charlequin</cite>TSR diluted the market with shitty D&amp;D products and drove their company to collapse; publishers with stars in their eyes diluted the market with shitty d20 products and sank the market for everyone.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm sure Matt will say that I'm using my industry experience to "swing my dick around" or something, but both of those are partially incorrect -- <br/><br/>Yes, TSR diluted the market (at one point having something like 6 different campaign settings available, for example), but it was largely a lack of inventory control, coupled with a horrible year for fiction releases leading to a massive book return that they weren't ready to absorb (although I doubt anyone would have been ready -- it was over a million copies returned as unsold in 1996 alone).   This lead to massive debt, and that ended the company.<br/><br/>The Publishers were only partially to blame for the d20 crash -- you can't really blame them though, because there have always been some publishers producing shitty product, d20 or not.   The problem was undiscerning distributors and retailers, who bought anything with d20 on it, because it was viewed as "free money" -- instant sales.    It wasn't.   Good products sold, bad products stacked up.   Distributors and Retailers kept buying anyway, until the bad product stack grew noticeable and THEN they got gunshy and stopped ordering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110938/#Comment_110938" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T12:39:29+00:00" title="December  1, 2007 12:39PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2007 2:08PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite><br/><br/>From what it looks like from here, you're asking me to tell you what mistakes are being made, specifically.

And I think (certainly I hope) Malcolm would agree that it doesn't<i>inherently</i>have anything to do with small vs. big games. TSR diluted the market with shitty D&amp;D products and drove their company to collapse; publishers with stars in their eyes diluted the market with shitty d20 products and sank the market for everyone.</blockquote>\nThat's exactly right. Remember that the basic interface for an online consumer and retailer is basically a time-sensitive index, with newer stuff in front. You might be led to a particular place by promotions or buzz, but browsing counts for a lot. The more you have to browse through crap the tougher it is.<br/><br/>I may be rough sometimes, but keep in mind that I've also told Matt Sprange to suck my dick, so I'm not discriminating on the basis of company size.\n<blockquote><br/>I do think that everytime someone publishes a game that isn't edited, isn't playtested, is pug-fugly, whatever, it hurts almost every other small independent game -- not<i>Dogs</i>or<i>Polaris</i>, but all the games that are good and worth buying but<i>don't</i>get the exposure of being in the indie scene's top 5. If the scene wants to be self-sustaining and to help everyone who can write a good game succeed, it should work to discourage the publication of lousy games.<br/></blockquote>\nI don't think that community standards are the best focus because there's are all kinds f interpersonal issues. I do think that there are workflow methods that *greatly* help with quality. Aeternal Legends was produced this way and from what I've gathered, Evil Hat's also getting into this kind of intensive critical collaboration.\n<blockquote>The same way, it doesn't reflect well on the scene that there's so little accessible advice about how to ethically employ people for the services your game needs but you can't provide yourself.  I don't think that most people who have published their own games and post to SG have taken advantage of artists and editors -- but my perception is that, a lot of the time, the tossed off advice is "get your friends to do it for free!"</blockquote>\nI was in fact given this advice. I didn't take it. Keep in mind that I don't ascribe malicious intent here. People have the *opportunity* to pay badly because of bigger issues in creative fields that create the *expectation* of poor pay. Plus, the idea that the Market instead of the time and effort spent should determine arrangements is a destructive meme affecting the whole process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110945/#Comment_110945" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T12:53:52+00:00" title="December  1, 2007 12:53PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>And there is this bullshit divide that I don't quite understand.

You can point at the business as something that isn't just a half-baked way to hide money.\n<blockquote>Also, who intentionally put out a shitty product they don't believe in? yeah, FATAL is not for me, but those guys believed in it, and no one made you read it. No one made me read it either, but actually it was entertaining in it's own way, so where's the crime? Oh, and sorry if it was Gareth that brought up FATAL, but the it addresses the point I'm trying to make.</blockquote>\nPeople sometimes let their enthusiasm to publish get the best of the work they should do to make something publishable.

Those standards might be different for every publisher, but there are certain things which sould be universal, including paying those who work on your products, and not taking anyone for granted."<br/><br/>Does that sound about right? If I got that right, I agree 100%.<br/><br/>Because what you're proposing is essentially a systemized way of respecting everyone involved. Respecting the customer by upholding standards. Respecting yourself by releasing the best product you can. Respect any co-creators/co-producers by giving them control over their contributions and paying them fairly.<br/><br/><br/>"Respect everyone involved" is a stance that is surprisingly rare.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------<br/><br/>Also, Malcolm, I want to commend you for naming names. It's something that people in this community always stress but never carry out. Being able to say "This is an example of what I'm talking about, this is where a gap exists" is an important thing, especially if you're offering warnings/admonitions to publishers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/charlequin" title="charlequin"><img alt="charlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/charlequin">charlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110956/#Comment_110956" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T13:39:06+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  1:39PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite><br/>I'm sure Matt will say that I'm using my industry experience to "swing my dick around" or something, but both of those are partially incorrect --<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, I wouldn't disagree that there's more factors that result in the actual economic damage in each situation, but I think it's reasonable to say that it's aided and abetted by the product glut in each situation. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite><br/>People have the *opportunity* to pay badly because of bigger issues in creative fields that create the *expectation* of poor pay. </blockquote>\nYeah, and that's definitely part of the issue here -- I mean, the issue of how creative work is valued and paid in general is a lot bigger than just the world of tabletop RPGs, and the way it's resolved elsewhere will affect how it's resolved in this particular microcosm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110987/#Comment_110987" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-01T17:06:39+00:00" title="December  1, 2007  5:06PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm, you've pointed at Ron before as an indication that most indie games pay artists crappily.

So, fair's fair.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>But, frankly, Gareth asked for a question in general, and when I gave him my answer he devalued my experience with his beliefs stated as facts and put himself as someone who is higher status than me in this conversation.</blockquote>\nHow did I do that?   Where did I devalue your experience?<br/><br/>(I'm not engaging in Internet Debate here, I really want to know.)<br/><br/>I'll take it to whisper.  I should also put out the following disclaimer:  You can't really argue with what I'm about to say.  You can tell me that you didn't intend for your words to have the effect they had, but because this is about my reaction to what you said, there's no logical debate here.<br/><br/>Upon asking the audience for why they're engaging in a certain activity (like publishing small games for sale), you turned their answer against them in a high-status way -- that you know more than me (which I greatly accept) and<em>that gives you the right to tell me I'm wrong.</em>You have a certain, strong belief in what constitutes a business, and you used that to create a binary situation:  either someone is in business as you judge a business or they aren't at all a business.  You took this binary value, looked at what I'm doing, and deemed it fit to express to me the following:  You don't fit my binary judgment so you aren't what you claim.<br/><br/>The honest fact is that I sell books for money, even if I don't look to profit for it.  You can decide what you want about that, and you're free to express any opinions on the subject, but when you go from that to declaring statements as if they are fact, you go to far and you're making value judgments.  What you do was the equivalent to, to use an analogy (which potentially means muddying the waters some more here):<br/>Guy:  Do you like apples?<br/>Girl:  I only like the red apples from my grandmother's orchard.<br/>Guy:  Then you don't like apples at all.<br/><br/>You could use a lot more "I think"- and "I believe"-type of things in your language, Gareth.  You do have good things to say -- in various private conversations, this comes up -- but because you use your long-standing beliefs as inflexible facts, the only thing you seem to succeed at here is piss people off and obfuscate your point in heated debate.  The simple fact is that both sides of various arguments you get involved in do this thing where they state opinions as facts, and the problem is that opinions can't be proven -- so people just go in fucking circles.  Opinions can be backed my experience and evidence, but they aren't truth/fact/immutable/etc.<br/><br/>I don't know how useful this is, but there you go.  And yes, it's all my opinion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>First of all, Ryan, I'm sorry that you feel that there was some sort of dominance game going on here -- there really wasn't.   It absolutely was not my intention to have it come off that way.<br/><br/>I have to say, though, that I wasn't expressing "a strong belief" as to what constitutes a business -- I was stating a factual definition from the real world, and defined by a very real field of study (economics).   A business is a legally-recognized organizational entity, existing within an economically free country, designed to sell goods and/or services to consumers or other businesses, in an effort to generate profit.<br/><br/>That's it.    There's no "high-status" bullshit there.   That's the definition of the word.    If you're not in an effort to generate profit,<b>you are not a business.</b>Simple fact.   No emotional context, no dominance games, no value judgements, beyond that simple fact.<br/><br/>For you to get upset about my use of that word in accordance with its definition.....well, that makes about as much sense as getting upset about me saying "Rain is largely comprised of water."</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Gareth, I told you that you couldn't argue here, and you're trying it.  You know how you're falling back on "agreeing to disagree" with Judd and others?  Please try it, and I will remember not to bother engaging you in discussion in the future.  [Edit: It's futile when I refuse to see this as anything but your opinion and you refuse to see it as anything but fact.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite><b>A definition used the world over is NOT AN OPINION</b>, you pathetic fucking cry-baby.   IT'S A FACT.     GET OVER IT.</blockquote>\nAnyway, I think I'll take Judd on is offer and also bow out here.

They mention it on boards like this and it makes no difference, because dilution affects all information channels -- not just storefronts. The likelihood that people will learn about the Suck gets lower, just like the chance of discovering the Awesome. <br/><br/>You are confusing an economic model with an ethical stance, blithely allowing the former to fill in for the latter. Capitalism is an economic model. You are responsible for participating in that system in an ethical fashion.

What constitutes "fair" might be a bone of contention of course. I do translation work for a living, and I fully expect to get paid a lot less for RPG-related stuff, and little to nothing for anime fan projects, especially compared to the work I do on mass-market video games.

I've had a number of unfortunate run-ins with artists who think it's perfectly okay for <i>me</i> to work for free against potential earnings while they should be paid handsomely up front.<br/><br/>I won't argue the relative merits of writing versus art because that's a fool's game, but I will say that writing is not easy even though those who do it well make it seem so.  And since the same can be said of artists, perhaps the best answer is for everyone involved in the "I should be paid X" debate to take a step back and look objectively at the financial reality of any given project before crafting demands and/or expectations regarding payment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111087/#Comment_111087" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T05:14:56+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  5:14AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Art gets mentioned because lots of small press people are the primary writers.

Now, I realize these definitions are a bit constrained, but indulge me.<br/><br/>Note: any name I use as an example below is based solely on my perception based on what I know/how well I know the people involved. If I name you, please excuse me, especially if I misrepresent your position, in which case, call me out immediately so that I may fix my examples.<br/><br/>Most folks here at SG who have a game out, from what I have seen and IMO, fall into the publisher camp: they had an idea, they wrote the game and wanted to see it out there, so they went through all the steps it takes to put together a finalized commercial-quality product and published it, but beyond that, they are not out to find other games to publish under their company name. I think everyone who publishes something has a vested interest in the financial well-being of that product, if only to recoup the initial costs and perhaps even fuel a later product, but beyond this, they are not terribly interested in pursuing the hardcore business strategy to get their game to produce as much profit as possible. So for example, you can have Judd publish Dictionary of Mu, and he wants to see the game out there, and he wants it to make back his investment, and now that it has, he think it's cool, especially because the profits from Mu most likely help out the initial investment for 1st Quest when it eventually gets out, but Judd isn't necessarily running Paka's Thread Games as a dedicated business pursuit, trying to get Mu into as many stores as possible, trying to maximize the profit potential of the book, building a brand that will eventually benefit anything else he publishes under that banner, and making financial decisions so that eventually, with a couple of books in its catalog, Paka's Thread Games can become a full-time profitable endavour. It's not that Judd doesn't think it would be awesome to have these things happen, and not that he doesn't pay attention to how well his book is doing or that he doesn't manage his finances in order to keep the book in print and supply demand, it's just that he's not in the business of being a Publisher; he's a game designer who published his game.<br/><br/>Cont.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111105/#Comment_111105" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T08:29:41+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  8:29AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Publishers, like Gareth, are in a different camp: they had an idea, they wrote the game and wanted to see it out there, so they went through all the steps it takes to put together a finalized commercial-quality product and published it, but then, after that, they decided that they were in for the long haul, and that they were going to run a publishing house; whether the next project was their own game or not (and in many cases it is, but it usually happens that you see that branching off), they were going to actively seek new projects to publish because publishing is a business pursuit for them, and without products coming out, the business cannot grow, sustain itself and eventually become profitable. Publishers (capital P) are pursuing a business with every move they make; they are looking for more than just a return on investment, they are actively seeking an expansion of their products and product lines, actively building brand recognition, actively managing finances that fuel one or two or three projects ahead, and actively seeking the growth of the company. So for example, you have Evil Hat, which started out with Fate, and then published Don't Rest Your Head and Spirit of the Century (and will eventually publish Dresden Files), and then it did something new in the "indie" field, it brought in Chad Underkoffler under its publishing wings, and officially became the new publisher of Atomic Sock Monkey Press products, doing the same as well with Daniel Solis's Do. I think with Evil Hat, and especially if you follow Fred's frequent posts on running the company, you can see very clearly the difference between publishing your book and running a publishing business; it's not that a publisher (small p) won't benefit from Fred's experience (quite the contrary, anyone who publishes a book can benefit from that kind of info), but a publisher is just not interested in taking those extra steps, in doing all that other work (because if they did, they would be Publishers), they're quite happy with their book being out there for folks to buy.<br/><br/>Because advances in technology mean that the entry barrier to publishing a book are super low, we find that a lot of people can be publishers, but not everyone is a Publisher. And frankly, not everyone is cut out to be a Publisher either; some folks will be perfectly fine being a publisher and that's it. But just because one is a publisher does not mean one is a Publisher; the only thing  they have in common is that both engage in the act of publishing a book.<br/><br/>Does this all make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/charlequin" title="charlequin"><img alt="charlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/charlequin">charlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111107/#Comment_111107" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T08:40:40+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  8:40AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I really don't think that Ron's practices (whatever they are) are used by anyone but Ron.

If you're a game designer who brings other people in to work on your project, you are <i>an employer</i>. The people who work on the project don't get paid by some nebulous capitalist force, they get paid <i>by you</i>. If the project isn't economically feasible once fair wages have been paid to those involved, then it <i>should not be done</i>, just like designer shoes should not be made if they can only be profitable with sweatshop labor.<br/><br/>As Malcolm said earlier, there's a fair way to keep initial costs down in small-press creative projects like this by sharing both risk and reward with your employees: if everyone does work "for free" upfront and shares equally in the profits from sales, you're bringing your artists &amp;c. in on the same model you (the publisher) are using: investing your labor for the hope of a monetary return. That's totally fine, and pretty much how I would expect most small-press projects like this to function.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111109/#Comment_111109" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T08:49:06+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  8:49AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2007 9:00AM by Southpaw.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: charlequin</cite><cite>Posted By: Sam I Am</cite><br/>It's not a question of<i>deserving</i>to be paid.

You keep using these passive voice sentences as if pay-for-work is something that comes out of the aether. It's not -- it's something that comes from specific people acting in the role of employer. <br><br>If you (this is the hypothetical "you" here) are an employer and you cannot afford to pay a fair wage to your employees, you have a <i>moral responsibility</i> not to undertake the project, or to alter it so that your wages can become fair. That's true of giant, transnational corporations (who are committing moral wrongs when they employ sweatshop labor or try to use legal loopholes to cheat employees of pay) and it's true of tiny independent publishing outfits. The fact that we live in a society in which immoral employment practices are common or encouraged does not make them moral, nor does it in any way reduce the moral imperative on employers to reject them in favor of fair pay.<br/><br/>It's true that "righteous indignation" isn't going to fix this problem for the whole world, but we're not talking about the whole world -- just this one little hobby.

I think with Evil Hat, and especially if you follow Fred's frequent posts on running the company, you can see very clearly the difference between publishing your book and running a publishing business; it's not that a publisher (small p) won't benefit from Fred's experience (quite the contrary, anyone who publishes a book can benefit from that kind of info), but a publisher is just not interested in taking those extra steps, in doing all that other work (because if they did, they would be Publishers), they're quite happy with their book being out there for folks to buy.</blockquote>\nVery close, I think.<br/><br/>Over time, I have found that I do not enjoy running the business operations of ASMP as much as I enjoy writing, game designing, and game production.

It's simply a question of big numbers here.</i><br/><br/>While it's true each individual customer has a limited amount of money and time to devote to any product, I think it's crucial to recognize:<br/><br/>a) Roleplaying games aren't just competing with each other, they're competing with all other forms of entertainment, and recently, there's a lot more entertainment that is interactive, social, and/or creative at the same time.<br/><br/>b) Not all forms of distribution/exposure are equal.   Indie games, are not pushing mainstream industry games off shelves.  For the most part, they're put where the small press games have always been- off to the side as curiosity items, and at best, they might get their own section.   <br/><br/>If we're talking the internet, how many people start their journey into tabletop roleplaying with an internet search, instead of looking at the website on the back of the book they just bought?  The major dilution they'll encounter in that, is numerous IRC/Forum games, and small press games would be a tiny, tiny fraction of that.  Not to mention, it''s not like the industry ever had a serious lock on the internet to begin with, so there's no real dilution in that, either.<br/><br/>c) The way in which the "industry" and "indie" networks of players do not overlap.  Traditional mainstream companies have focused mostly on long term play.  Customers will be looking for products that either their friends are playing, or will be easily convinced into playing (with the major issue being that learning the rules does make for a barrier of entry).  (EDIT FOR EXAMPLE: Much like the way in which computer customers look for software  for their current OS, not constantly comparing OS's unless they're very dissatisfied in the first place.)  <br/><br/>In that regard, indie games have only pulled away a marginal number of people, most of whom, were basically unsatisfied with the industry options already.  We don't see diehard gamers of the mainstream games abandonding campaigns to play small press games, we see the disatisfied folks or the people who stopped playing years ago, or have never played a roleplaying game before making up the majority of the indie networks.<br/><br/>With that, the two major differences are that the small press games have utilized a lot more options which are safer investments from a business standpoint and generally made play and building play networks the focus of a sustainable hobby.   Were it simply numbers to succeed, WOTC would shit out the rpg equivalent of Cheapass Games and be done with it.  Instead, people who buy D&amp;D buy it because they either already are playing it, or know they can get friends together to play it, and hopefully they're having fun with it, not because it has 400 supplements to it.<br/><br/>With all that in mind, the biggest effect that the small press has had on the traditional industry is providing valuable information on alternative business and play models they would not have normally gambled on.  For example, Greg Stolze is using Lulu to print Reign, D&amp;D 4E is using Actual Play reports to produce hype, and various companies have started either selling PDFs or at least using them as a medium for promotion.<br/><br/>All in all, this whole thought of "dilution" seems to be based in a failure to examine the really crucial question- can you create a play network that has an engaging enough activity to compete with the online experience- whether WoW, threadwars in forums, or looking at porn?<br/><br/>Ryan Dancey's recent thoughts on the numbers in rpg sales is pretty worth looking at too:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showpost.php?p=149735&amp;postcount=160" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showpost.php?p=149735&amp;postcount=160</a><br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111189/#Comment_111189" name="Item_192" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T19:55:13+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  7:55PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            a) People have always had more things to do than time to do it in. The attached buzzwords are not especially important.<br/><br/>b) Anybody who's had a chance to analyze OBS sales knows that people do in fact buy things after category-directed browsing and that vendor-indexed reviews don't matter much (and of course, the theoretical guy who gets into gaming via web browsing is not even the subject of this thread). An RPGNet review sometimes matters, but not much. Browsing is a huge source of direct sales. The larger the small press index, the more difficult browsing is, the less there is to go around and the more people inadvertently pick up crap. The metaphor of a store with shelves is pretty off, since these issues take place outside of and before actual brick and mortal get into it, and across multiple consumer and retail sales.<br/><br/>Of course, there are times when shelf space does come into it. Take the Forge Booth at Gen Con 2006, which posted record sales -- but awful sales past the top tier. Dilution has already had an effect in the indie-brand corner.<br/><br/>c) The idea that the "indie" and "mainstream" (not the skepti-quotes) have mutually exclusive fan bases is . . . off. It also panders to the worse excesses of dogmatic thinking to believe there's an US and THEM, but that's another discussion. The guys who only play one game are not even in the picture, and the ones that don't do not fit into pure categories, no matter how much RPGSite and Forge wankers alike love narratives about how someone has seen the light and doesn't play Bad Games any more. Of course, giving these narrative privilege is basically taking a big dump on everybody with flexible tastes, too.<br/><br/>d) People have been using Actual Play as a promotional tool forever. Offhand, I remember reading about Immortals Rules play reports in White Dwarf when . . . well, back when WD actually would mention anything about that sort of thing. It's only become the Capitalized Term of Actual Play after it became apparent that a lot of people were talking instead of playing anything. This is still true to a certain extent (remember Jack Spenser Jr?), but the formal AP phenomenon is a response to a problem, not a straightforward positive development.<br/><br/>The points of innovation lie with technologies that have changed publishing, which everyone has access to and used as soon as it became available. Mentioning this as a point of innovation is kind of like taking credit for the end of the Cold War because the Berlin Wall fell in your lifetime. You're welcome. Also, I invented the Internet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111207/#Comment_111207" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T23:06:41+00:00" title="December  2, 2007 11:06PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite><i>This means that each individual product gets less attention from the CUSTOMERS.

Indie games, are not pushing mainstream industry games off shelves. For the most part, they're put where the small press games have always been- off to the side as curiosity items, and at best, they might get their own section.</blockquote>\nAgreed, for the most part. <br/><br/>However, consider that d20 publishing. d20 products are pushing/had pushed other d20 products off of shelves. That's the primary effect.<br/><br/>Overall glut and dead inventory of one sector of product (say, d20 products) can squeeze all other gaming products off the shelves -- less GURPS books, less White Wolf, less side-shelf space for indie games (carried in distro/retail). That's the secondary effect. . . and may or may not have been minor.<br/><br/>The tertiary effects, and perhaps as powerful as the primary one, are:<br/>A. the customer looks at the dead inventory which doesn't interest him or her, hasn't changed, and has sat on the same shelf for months or years, and loses interest in searching between the dead inventory for new inventory placed there.<br/><br/>B. The retailer, seeing low sales of dead inventory (in this example, d20 products), determines that GAMING PRODUCTS aren't selling. Which is both true and untrue -- the dead inventory isn't selling, and is depressing sales of other stuff, because there's no room for other stuff on the physical shelf.<br/><br/>Again, that's retail. I don't think it necessary directly disagrees with what you're saying.<br/><br/><br/>continued in next post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111209/#Comment_111209" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T23:06:56+00:00" title="December  2, 2007 11:06PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>If we're talking the internet, how many people start their journey into tabletop roleplaying with an internet search, instead of looking at the website on the back of the book they just bought? The major dilution they'll encounter in that, is numerous IRC/Forum games, and small press games would be a tiny, tiny fraction of that. Not to mention, it''s not like the industry ever had a serious lock on the internet to begin with, so there's no real dilution in that, either.</blockquote>\nI don't think we're talking about NEW GAMING CUSTOMER here. I think we're talking about REGULAR GAMING CUSTOMER -- and more than that: a REGULAR GAMING CUSTOMER WHO BUYS VARIED PRODUCTS. <br/><br/>That's the customer that any sort of expansion/dilution of the market sidetracks.<br/><br/>See below for more.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>c) The way in which the "industry" and "indie" networks of players do not overlap. Traditional mainstream companies have focused mostly on long term play. Customers will be looking for products that either their friends are playing, or will be easily convinced into playing (with the major issue being that learning the rules does make for a barrier of entry). <br/><br/>(snip)<br/><br/>In that regard, indie games have only pulled away a marginal number of people, most of whom, were basically unsatisfied with the industry options already. We don't see diehard gamers of the mainstream games abandonding campaigns to play small press games, we see the disatisfied folks or the people who stopped playing years ago, or have never played a roleplaying game before making up the majority of the indie networks.</blockquote>\nI disagree that it's a pulling away, or that people buying indie games are necessarily unsatisfied with the mainstream. I personally know a fairly large number of people who play both mainstream and indie games. Playing isn't zero-sum, but purchasing might be.<br/><br/>I could be wrong, here. I only know the demographics of the gamers I personally know/read.<br/><br/>That being said, yes, there are customers who focus on one "slice" of the market to the exclusion of the rest of the market. That could be "only WotC products" or "only d20 products" or "only d20 products produced by Company X" or "just White Wolf products" or "just Exalted products" or "just indie games" or "just indie games made by people I know" or any other criteria you care to name.<br/><br/>The narrower the customer's slice, the less impact market dilution has. If you only buy WoD books, a million d20 products on your shops physical or virtual shelves makes no difference, except if they physically (in real world) or visually (online) crowd the WoD product you're looking for out of view -- the minor secondary factor mention above, which leads to the tertiary factor. <br/><br/>Say that all of the WoD product gets pushed off of the front page of an online shop, in favor of, hell, let's say FGU product (mystically, FGU has a sudden renaissance). The casual customer looks at the page, sees all FGU and no WoD, and keeps on passing by. (However, a WoD customer with a history of buying from said shop and the drive to continue a page in is unaffected by this -- they are motivated enough to know where to look and keep looking, and they effectively ignore the FGU material.) <br/><br/>The wide-slice folks -- in my experience, folks who are fans of games in general, be they mainstream or indie or board or card or whatever -- are often very casual customers when presented with the market. Thus dilution/expansion affects them.<br/><br/>Indeed, I think that's true even for a wide-slice customer who comes to the store/shop looking for a specific game they're heard the buzz on (say, Beast Hunters). If they fail to find a copy of BH (and, if they're particularly flush with cash at the moment, possibly even if they do acquire it), many will look for "what else in the shop looks good" in a very casual way, wanting to make a purchase. This is where dilution affects the wide-slice customers, the most likely people to purchase any unfamiliar game (and, I aver, especially indie games).<br/><br/>Does that make any sense?<br/><br/>CU                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111210/#Comment_111210" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T23:10:26+00:00" title="December  2, 2007 11:10PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>b) Anybody who's had a chance to analyze OBS sales knows that people do in fact buy things after category-directed browsing and that vendor-indexed reviews don't matter much (and of course, the theoretical guy who gets into gaming via web browsing is not even the subject of this thread).

Budo does pretty well despite the resentment that hardcore Wushu people have expressed because I didn't somehow get their permission and violated some special Wushu design principles or something. The reviews have been so so. I think it's a great game, but I have to admit that a lot of its success is an indexing effect. The listed system only has three publishers (Wushu creator Dan Bayn, Clint Krause and me) and it's cross-listed with a genre that has few small press releases. "Asian" is also the first Fantasy subcategory release.<br/><br/>The point is that even though I put some thought into it (and even revised it, because the set of people who understand koryu bugei terms is smaller than I thought:-), it has multiple success factors that have nothing to do with its content except for filtering tags.<br/><br/>Now consider, by comparison, that the thing *outranking* it in the Fantasy/Asian category right now is a pdf of The Book of Five Rings: a text with multiple free translations online. I'm not saying it sucks, but it's not exactly being driven by community-creating hype. It's taking advantage of those same indexing properties.<br/><br/>I think better segmenting by quality and publisher scale would be great. One of the reasons IPR was such a good fit for Aeternal Legends is because the products are reviewed and identified with a particular segment. When RPGNow started the Edge thing pre-merger I welcomed it for much the same reason. But I think that in addition, giving a little thought to what *should* be entering such systems and holding back until you can make it really worth the consumer's while would be a great idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111224/#Comment_111224" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T00:50:10+00:00" title="December  3, 2007 12:50AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2007 1:04AM by bankuei.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chad,<br/><br/>I think it's really important to consider this all in the context of the dilution argument made in this thread- that small publishers are glutting and choking out the "industry" publishers (I use quotes here not to dismiss the term, but to note that we're talking about a very narrow definition, which counts folks like R.Talsorian and Fiery Dragon but not other small publishers in a pretty arbitrary fashion, so it's important to keep in mind when I use the word).<br/><br/>As many have noted, the D20 glut does fill the shelves and weigh down the FLGS economy- but how many people note the important aspect that D20 material is supplemental to WOTC's D20 games, and not alternative competing games?

By "literally," I mean that there are top level indices devoted to them and no point making the comparison. I am not talking about theory, but what happens when you hit RPGNow. There are 15 companies that are direct-linked out of a combination of popularity and courtesy, and everybody else. Those 15 aren't crowding out everybody else nor (and this is where I disagree with Gareth slightly) vice versa. Hell, even some of those 15 are dead wood. (DP9? Seriously?)<br/><br/>IPR is a better bet because its products have been vetted. The Forge community has introduced a similar process by having members with cred tell other people that their games suck, are tantamount to stealing from the customer and should be in a special, different booth.\n<blockquote>I feel like the initial argument is like pointing to 10 guys who get overpaid on their Social Security checks and blaming them for the collapse of the nation's infrastructure- it requires ignoring larger context to an amazing degree.</blockquote>\nI think it would really help you make your point if you went with less metaphor and more fact. When I talk about how and when things sell I'm talking about *real* things. It is not my pet theory that front page exposure causes significant sales bumps. It's what actually happens when something of mine hits the front page. When I talk about the treadmill effect being universal and not the result of the system you think is Bad and Wrong, I'm not pulling it out of my ass -- I'm referring to people who identified themselves as having been shuffled off onto it in *your* community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111279/#Comment_111279" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T07:43:00+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  7:43AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2007 7:45AM by Neko_Ewen.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I give up.

When I want a cyberpunk short story book written by new authors, I can dump all of that into Amazon and find exactly what I'm looking for. With a smaller, more hand-carried selection, I think the system would work even better; heck, most of the time you could contact an author in this scene yourself if you were so inclined.

That's not the divide. The divide is between people who are publishing-to-publish *into the market* -- at a loss -- and people who are publishing-for-profit into the market. (Note that I don't count those people who publish-to-publish on the web or blog or fora in the former category; creation for creation's sake is fantastic. But if you're going to play in business, the whole system only works if people are playing by the same rules.)<br/><br/>I think the argument is that publishers-operating-at-a-loss are choking not just publishers-operating-as-a-business but also other publishers-operating-at-a-loss, with side issues about quality levels of products and customer overload/confusion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite> It's weird to point to, say, Capes and say "Fie unto you for crowding out the shelves!" when in fact, it's folks who are basically working to make supplemental material FOR the industry (or at least the leader of the industry).</blockquote>\nWell, I never said that about Capes. Indeed, I was the one who started talking about d20 crowding.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>And, if we're talking about the casual wide slice customer who is looking for variety, I have a hard time believing that the indie wave is working against their needs as much as the outsourced voluntary supplement treadmill that is SRD/D20/OGL.</blockquote>\nBoth are true. The casual wide-slice customer is affected by glut, be it d20 glut, indie glut, or (as I think, both). But indie glut most affects the wide-slice customer who's already interested in indie games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>Second, concerning online sites, it's also ridiculous to point to the small publishers as the cause of what effectively is bad site design and store management.(snip) It's like pointing to the publishers of books as the problem if you walk into a messy, kluttered, mismanaged bookstore.</blockquote>\nThat's not a bad point, but consider that the small size and insular nature of the gaming industry means that gaming publishers have a disproportionate voice with the major sales online sales sites compared to a B&amp;M bookstore.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>In the long run, we're going to see more online stores "get it" and do just that- put the biggest/most consistent sellers up front, </blockquote>\nNot necessarily: the OBS storefronts have gone to weird algorithms to determine what's a "hot-seller." For example, pre-merger, T&amp;J used to be in the top 10 or 20 non-d20 RPGs in the topsellers list. Now, it's near the bottom of the top 100. The online storefronts are not tracking biggest/most consistent sellers any more.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>I'm in agreeance that it's a tiny group who are focused on one set of publishers to the exclusion of others, but if we aren't talking about them- has the purchasing ratios of the wide slice customer changed -that- much? Haven't they been buying random small press stuff from the beginning, whether we're talking Timelords or Usagi Yojimbo? </blockquote>\nSomething has changed. The merger of the two biggest online RPG shops (RPGNow and DTRPG) has led to higher sales overall, but nearly every publisher I've talked to has reported lower individual sales. The merger combined two gigantic dBs of product, creating a glut.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>And if the purchasing ratio has changed that much AND wide slice customers make up that much of the market, do we point to small press publishers for meeting the demand for variety or to the industry publishers for failing to do so? You could easily say that the glut of publishing is on the hands of the industry publishers for pouring out lots of investment and supplements for a few game lines instead of diversifying in the first place.</blockquote>\nTo reiterate: we're not talking (at least I'm not talking) about glut affecting D&amp;D/WotC. I am talking about glut affecting me, Fred Hicks, Ron Edwards, Clinton Nixon, Jared Soresenson, John Wick, Tony LB, Clash Bowley, Malcom Sheppard, etc. etc. <br/><br/>That is, your indie friends and neighbors.

I go away for a couple of days to help my folks lug some furniture around and come back to a three page thread. Anyways, I'm going to reply to a bunch of posts all at once, so hope this doesn't get too confusing. Hm. Looks like I need to break this up into two posts. lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier it was suggested that no one in the industry has a clue about the industry. That is patently untrue. There are a good number of folks that own companies in this industry that understand it very well and has spent years or decades gathering information on it. Its only that this data is all internalized and gathered by each firm independently. Some of my long time friends in the industry are always collecting and updating this stuff and when we get the opportunity to, we share and compare to make sure we all have the most up to date info as possible. To persons who haven't been operating within the industry for long, or at all, it only seems like there is no data. This is because the industry is just too small for anyone to make a profit collecting, publishing or selling it as a business. And most companies are privately held, so an enterprising outside party can't just scour SEC filing to garner it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt I have done a fraction of the consulting that Gareth has, but I have done some in the past. In the future, we are considering hosting publishing seminars at our retail locations. As for sharing what I know, I am always willing to answer questions online. Otherwise, I can tell you that Chris Clark from Inner City Game Designs, Bill Corrie from HinterWelt Enterprises and myself have begun a collaboration on the Game Publishers' Digest, which will be released as 46 topical issues in PDF format, then later published as a four book set. Marcus King of Titan Games has also agreed to write commentary on each subject from a retailer's perspective. But the project has just begun and we want to put the first 5-10 inssues in the can before releasing the first one.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;You mentioned earlier that there is a difference between a game designer and a game publisher. What is the difference and how do some game designers muck shit up and make mistakes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111344/#Comment_111344" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T11:21:48+00:00" title="December  3, 2007 11:21AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;The conflict is this: People who make their living -- as in pay for heat and food and medical insurance and shit -- are, somewhat understandably, defensive about their profession.&gt;It doesn't.

A thriving online community designing and releasing nicely done free pdf roleplaying games is just as much a glut problem from your perspective as a glut of games the designers are charging for? You're not saying "don't publish if you don't want to be a business," you're saying "don't design"?<br/><br/>I'm saying "don't publish and operate in the market with a for-pay product if you don't want to be a business." That's my opinion.<br/><br/>I hold that more products equals glut, whether they're utter crap or utter genius. "Glut" is a value neutral term, meaning "increased volume." (As I've noted earlier, the glut/increased product volume issue is simply a mathematical discussion, and <b>completely unrelated</b> to relative quality of products. A glut of awesome work is still a glut, and will impact across-the-board sales in the marketplace.)<br/><br/>If you want to design, go for it. If you want to offer your work for free, all the better.<br/><br/>But if you want to offer your work on the market, charging customers for the product, it's distasteful -- and harmful to the market -- to both undercharge for the product and to "spam" the marketplace with undervalued products. <br/><br/>The former leads to an undervaluing of the work necessary to create a game (by authors, artists, editors, and layout folks), and the latter leads to glut/increased product volume.<br/><br/>To sum up, my position is that if you want to play in the for-pay market, play by the for-pay rules. If you just want to design games and have people play them, release them for free (and bless you!).<br/><br/>Is that clearer?<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111475/#Comment_111475" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T21:15:27+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  9:15PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>Hi Chad,<br/><br/>From what you've just said, it seems to me that the real issue to look at is:<br/><br/>a) the wider context of the games market (videogames, CCGs, MMO's etc.)</blockquote>\nI remain unconvinced that videogames, CCGs, MMORPGs, etc., have sucked away wide-slice customers.

How is designing and offering my work for free as a nicely done pdf not spamming the marketplace with an "undervalued product"?</blockquote>\nBecause "free" equals "not in the market." A free product doesn't compete for dollars.<br/><br/>That being said, given the nature of the online channels we have currently, placing a free product on a sales site very well could be "spamming the market" or "contributing to glut," simply in increasing the amount of material a customer has to look through. That is, while a free product doesn't compete for dollars, it does compete for eyes/attention.<br/><br/><b>Glut = increased volume</b> and <b>market = money</b> are two separate -- if entwined -- issues. The entanglement comes, I think, especially online from the limited number of sales/distribution channels (and their operation and procedures.)<br/><br/>Here's an illustrative example involving apples.<br/><br/>Glut = the apple stand is four crates wide. <br/><br/>If there are four crates of apples, one can easily tell that one is Macintosh, the next is Gala, the next is Granny Smith, and the next is Jonagold.<br/><br/>If suddenly the stand gets twelve more crates of different apples, those sixteen crates can only be stacked in four ranks of four. The front rank will obscure the signs -- and even the crates themselves -- of the dozen behind. A casual customer may assume that there are only four types of apple available at the moment. Another customer may peer into the depths, see three more rows of crates with different apples, and throw up his hands and walk away. However, the customer who already bought some Honeycrisps from that apple stand (or has come specifically to look for Honeycrisps because he's heard this stand has them) is much less daunted by the four ranks of four.<br/><br/>Market = most apples cost around a quarter (plus or minus).<br/>Placing eight more crates of free apples next to the quarter-priced ones makes it even harder to even see which apples are for sale. Remember, the stand is only four crates wide, and we just added two more rows of crates. It's even more difficult to see what's for sale in the back now. However, the free apples aren't directly competing for the customer's dollar -- they're more likely to indirectly affect sales (the customer purchases fewer of the for-pay apples and makes up the slack with the free ones).<br/><br/>Underpriced apples -- say, a dime (because the orchard owner makes his grandkids pick the apples for free rather than paying them) -- can cause the same visual confusion as free products, but then there are other issues involved. If an apple producer decides that they have no need to make any money on selling their apples, and wish only to get them out there and undervalue the apples' price rather than offer them for free, they are causing customers to look at the quarter cost apples and the dime cost apples and compare prices. This can lead to the customer thinking that the quarter cost apples are overpriced, despite being priced reasonably -- it's the dime cost apples that are underpriced. Thus, the dime apples are directly competing with the quarter apples for both dollars and attention.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>You don't believe that a thriving online community designing and releasing nicely done free pdf games is just as much a problem for the market as it would be if the designers were charging for the games?</blockquote>\nNo and yes. <br/><br/>If the free games are not in the marketplace/sales site/game shop, then no -- I don't think they compete <i>directly</i>, and are not much of a problem. <br/><br/>They may, however, affect the market as a whole <i>indirectly</i>, because if lots of well-done games are free and readily available, the number of customers even entering a shop willing to spend dollars on games may reduce somewhat.

I've definitely seen worse, and as long as the check comes through you're one of the good guys, in my book.<br/><br/>However....<br/><br/>Even though any artist can likely turn out a drawing (of some sort) in an hour, alotting only an hour for a drawing means (regardless of how relatively good the artist is) that you are getting a drawing which is not all it could be. Paying even slightly more would allow the same artist to take more time to refine and improve the drawing while still making the same hourly rate. That will generally result in a better drawing <i>from the same artist.</i> <br/><br/>Pay me for an hour, and I could knock out a modest drawing for you, no problem. But pay me enough that I could put two hours into it, and you'd get three times the drawing. So it's up to you to decide which drawing you would want based on finding a balance between what your budget will allow and what level of quality you feel is "good enough" for your needs. If that's a one-hour drawing, so be it, but you should be aware of the choice you're making. After all, even Elmore isn't going to give you his best work if he feels rushed.<br/><br/>I also believe (even though some artists are certainly faster than others in achieving a comparable level of quality) that a good many of the artists who demand higher rates don't do so because they are so wildly talented they can turn out their best work in an hour and just want more money for their time. I'd bet most do it because they prefer not to rush out work that is not up to their personal standards.<br/><br/>Just some food for thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111570/#Comment_111570" name="Item_225" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T09:05:35+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  9:05AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Chad,<br/><br/>Y'know, I think the "yes and no" and "maybe" and "dollars" vs "eyes/attention" qualifiers are uncertainties resulting from perspective.<br/><br/>If what we're doing is an industry and dilution is a problem, then it's a Tragedy of the Commons that's simply not solvable by trying to convince market participants not to participate (or that they actually don't want to participate). It's in the individual interest of participants to exploit the shared resource (customer attention and dollars) to the best of their ability. You solve a Tragedy of the Commons via regulation, or force (neither of which is going to happen here).<br/><br/>But I don't think it is an industry. I think it's a hobby. And that it's not a Tragedy of the Commons. I know that I've personally put more money into Peter Adkison's pocket, and into the pockets of other hobby participants in the past five years than in the entire previous 24 years I've been involved with it. Participants in a hobby grow it, in real terms (money spent, and time and energy invested). If the merger of RPGNow and DTRPG is resulting in more stuff for sale and higher overall sales, that's because we're seeing an expansion of participation in the core roleplaying hobby activity: making and expressing a sense of the world, the human experience, and the self via shared experiences of imagination and story making.<br/><br/>And structuring the experiences of others is a part of feeding what you've learned back into that core activity. Design itself is fundamental to the core activity. True participation entails being both a producer and a consumer.<br/><br/>I expect the future holds continued expansion of participation, by folks with a passion for both the experience and the design facets of the core activity, and at a pace that's increasingly going to take your breath away.<br/><br/>This only produces anxiety when you're looking at it from a market perspective. A decline in revenue feels like it's squeezing you out of what you've chosen to do. But that's not true at all. When you transition from a market perspective to a core activity perspective you're struck by just how much more there is you can do. And the folks that do so aren't anxious at all. The guy who comes to Gen Con with a hundred copies of his game and a goal of selling them all, but who otherwise doesn't participate in the design community, comes home disappointed. The folks who play and playtest the games of other designers, and learn from them, who provide feedback to games in development, their sales are evergreen. The hobby knows its core activity.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111575/#Comment_111575" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T09:10:11+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  9:10AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>I apologize, I had assumed you were coming from the point of the original dilution argument- as I stated above, putting this as the primary problem above splitting between markets - and the implied solution being that small publishers should publish less.</blockquote>\nFair enough.

As long as they are paid, the rates just are what they are. I'd certainly <i>like</i> it if the industry standard rates were higher, but hey....\n<blockquote>I as a business have no "moral" obligation to pay some artists or all artists $100 a page for B&amp;W just because that is what some artist somewhere feel that is what they are worth. That's like some guy looking to work the assembly line in a GM plant coming in and saying, I know you guys pay your union like workers like $29 an hour, but I am special and unique so you have a moral obligation to both give me this job and pay me $50 an hour instead. Try that sometime when interviewing for a company with fixed tier wages for the position you want and see how well it goes. I just don't think its a stance founded upon reality.</blockquote>\nWell, the thing is... that's not really what we have happening, for the most part.  $100 a page is still pretty crappy pay if high quality work is expected (and, let's face it, it is. Publishers expect a good effort, no matter how little they're paying) . Artists in the rpg industry, generally speaking, aren't getting union wages (working elsewhere pays more by several orders of magnitude, there's where you'll find the equivalent of "union wages") because they're usually not actually knocking out a rush job in an hour. They want to do a good job too, nobody wants to be seen as a hack who knocks out half-assed work. So, in comparison, they're usually getting something closer to an illegal immigrant migrant worker's pay, and griping because they'd like to make minimum wage. <br/><br/>Nobody you can really point at to blame though (even though some try). It just is what it is.

Or don't care whether the work you're putting out there for everyone to see is your best.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there are drawings I could do well in an hour. There are drawings I could do well in twenty minutes. But many of the drawings I've had people commission are not the sort that I'd be comfortable rushing out in two hours, much less an hour.<br/><br/>Though really, twenty bucks for a drawing with modest detail is not a bad rate <i>for this industry</i>. I've run into people who expect that for five.<br/><br/><br/>Edit:<br/>Thinking about all this, it occurs to me that there may be some confusion about what goes into a drawing <i>for commission</i>. Folks may be seeing "an hour to make a drawing" and wondering what the big deal is. Well, the "for commission" is important to consider. When doing a drawing for myself, I can just draw it. I make all the decisions, and it can go pretty fast. With a commission, that's a whole other ballgame. <br/><br/>I may have to dig up references, if there's something specific the publisher is looking for. Or maybe I'll get lucky and be able to go straight to work, but I can't count on it. Then I've got to do a sketch and send it off for review. There will probably be revisions, maybe even multiple rounds of review/revision (I've spent more than an hour just in scanning and emailing and revising to meet what the publisher has in his head - if the publisher isn't good at explaining what he's looking for, a one hour drawing could eat up most of your day).

A free product doesn't compete for dollars.</blockquote>\nChad, <br/><br/>I'm going to come at this from a consumer POV for one second, because I don't feel that this is the whole picture. <br/><br/>Right now I have more games than I am going to play in the next 5 years. I have gotten to the point where I am very specific about what games I pick up, or even download for free, because I have such a glut of material that I already have access to -- not even that I have to purchase or acquire -- that I have no need to get more. In fact, I sometimes feel mildly annoyed when folks want me to review their game, even if they're offering me comps because I don't fucking have time for that. (I usually do it anyway, because I'm a chump.) <br/><br/>So in this one tiny corner of the market over here you are not competing with other for pay products for my money. You are competing with everything I have available to me for my attention. If I get, say Swashbucklers or not will not depend on if I can afford it or not economically with all the other games I have to buy, but whether I can bring myself to even think about it with all the other games I have to think about. <br/><br/>Seriously, if I want your game I have enough money that I can pick it and a bunch of other games up at the same time. But to even make me want your game you have to compete not with the other games for my money (who cares, I've got it), but for my time an attention (which is severely limited). <br/><br/>Also, there is a degree to which it is my attention with other RPGs. I spend a certain amount of time a month doing RPG stuff, and a certain amount, say, watching movies. At this point in my life, I'm pretty stable about how much of which I'm going to do -- so better movies or video games aren't likely to decrease my RPGing time. I have a pretty good feeling this isn't how it works with say, many d20 players drifting to World of Warcraft, but it is how it works in my life. I've got X hours a month that go to RPGing, and those X hours aren't getting sucked out by other hobbies. But in those X hours I do not have time for all of you, even the all of you that are awesome, and so I will not give you my time or attention because there is too much else to do in my allotted time. <br/><br/>Now what does this mean to the market and the glut and all that? I dunno, and frankly I don't care enough to try to figure it out. I'm not saying anything about that, and I'm not publishing or Publishing RPGs atm. I am just saying that at this point my personal response to glut isn't that folks have to compete for my money, its that they have to compete for my attention, that it is RPG against RPG, and that free or pay makes very little difference save that I may be more likely (being brainwashed) to assume an RPG I have to pay for is actually better done. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm the exception that proves the rule, but there it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111686/#Comment_111686" name="Item_238" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T13:39:53+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  1:39PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><cite>Posted By: chadu</cite>Because "free" equals "not in the market."

This is a fantastic reply. <br/><br/>Your position doesn't necessarily conflict with my feelings/opinions on this. . . it's just you're an attention-oriented customer, mostly, rather than a cost-oriented customer (or even a mix of both).<br/><br/>Interestingly (and correct me if I'm wrong in this assumption made from some of the snipped bits), the gaming market isn't even mostly competing for your attention among available products. . .

A thriving online community designing and releasing nicely done free pdf roleplaying games is just as much a glut problem from your perspective as a glut of games the designers are charging for? You're not saying "don't publish if you don't want to be a business," you're saying "don't design"?<br/><br/>Paul<br/><br/>I think it's a pity that there isn't nearly as much variety and activity in free game production as there used to be. I think the era of games like Thrash was marvelous. Current free games are basically short sketches produced for contests that may or may not become polished later. <br/><br/>I also think that in a way, open source has actually poisoned the culture of free game design, because gamers now impose mental speedbumps on their approach to inspiring work instead of just taking things and running with them. While I'm sure some people were frightened by Palladium and TSR, their attempts to control house rules didn't really work. Things like the glorious, uneven content of BJ Zanzibar's WoD site and other grey-area game hacks are gone and there's a pervasive feeling that mere fair use isn't enough to justify getting it out there; you need some tedious supporting legalese or other community permission, to boot.<br/><br/>(This sort of thing has a bad effect on companies, too. One example is Technomancer Press, which was pilloried in part for exercising fair use. They had the temerity to make D&amp;D compatible products without using a license. Remember when TSR actually had to *fight* the fans to attack people like this? Keep in mind I'm not talking about their claims of compatibility, which were not so smart.) <br/><br/>I'm not sure, but I suspect that there's a connection between the bloated, uneven state of small for-pay RPG publishers and the simultaneous decline of the interesting, chaotic and fearless free games scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111700/#Comment_111700" name="Item_240" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T15:23:18+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  3:23PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>Things like the glorious, uneven content of BJ Zanzibar's WoD site and other grey-area game hacks are gone and there's a pervasive feeling that mere fair use isn't enough to justify getting it out there;</blockquote>\nIt is still out there. You just can't see it any more, because the web's too big. It's not centralized any more, but everybody and their brother still throws My Houserules That Totally Rock up on their web page or a message board or their LJ or some such. Nobody links to it much, so it doesn't rate on search engines, and you can't find it unless you know about it offline.<br/><br/>That, and a lot of people got stars in their eyes and thought they could monetize My Houserules That Totally Rock. But after the crash, and with 4E coming down the pike, you'll see more of it creep out into freeware again.<br/><br/>This is all really pretty much the same argument that every other IP-centric market is thrashing through now. In the end, it's going to be damn near impossible to make a living from your IP as a private individual, but much, much easier to capture a small income stream from it without involving any "publisher" if you don't want to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111706/#Comment_111706" name="Item_241" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T15:29:38+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  3:29PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>I'm not sure, but I suspect that there's a connection between the bloated, uneven state of small for-pay RPG publishers and the simultaneous decline of the interesting, chaotic and fearless free games scene.</blockquote>\nI was just talking to Fred Hicks about this recently, in the context of the original free release of things like Fudge and Fate (a hack of Fudge) and high-quality free stuff like Scarlet Wake.  There was also, recently, a bunch of indie designers who had free games on their personal websites: Zak Arntson, Jared Sorenson, Paul Czege, and Vincent Baker, among others. I've played a bunch of those actually: Shadows, Metal Opera, Otherkind, The World The Flesh &amp; The Devil, The Valedictorian's Death, Nicotine Girls.  Many of those are still up, so I think there's a good chance that free games will be making a comeback, once the tide swings around again.  Scratch under the surface of the indie games community and you find a lot of good, playtested, relatively polished games that are up for free.  (There also all of Greg Stolze's games that have been successfully ransomed). Clinton's new online text of TSOY is a cool move in that direction, as is the posting of the free parts of Spirit of the Century / Fate 3.  Personally, I would love it if we could convince Jason Morningstar to make some of his wackier projects (like Drowning &amp; Falling, Business Solutions, or Medical Hospital) into free games with, say, charity donation buttons or ransoms, since D&amp;F was a charity project anyway.<br/><br/>This could be a core part of the community again.

It's like they're saying "Oh yeah, you don't want my free thing? Fine, then you can't have it! You have to <i>pay</i> for it instead." And the thing is, sometimes that <i>works</i>, since there's pervasive mistrust of free stuff, this attitude that if you don't have to pay for something, it's because it's not worth anything.<br/><br/>And really, if I was a little less hyper-critical of my own work, I could see doing the same thing. Money, even a pitifully small amount of it, is a form of validation. I know if I ever got around to finishing a game I'd get more satisfaction out of selling 12 copies of it over the course of a year than I would from getting a couple of lukewarm "yeah, nice game, I guess" comments from my LiveJournal buddies. Of course, I'd derive even <i>more</i> satisfaction from giving my game away for free and seeing lots of people play it and have fun with it -- or even seeing lots of people hate it and tell me in no uncertain terms what sucked about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111758/#Comment_111758" name="Item_249" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T18:24:52+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  6:24PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, that's exactly what I was thinking of when I said that it would become relatively easy to monetize this stuff in small ways, but much more difficult to make a living from it.

this massive and flamey thread about the evils of dilution, but I have to ask...is there actually a demonstrable glut in the small press game market that is hurting you folks?  Are you seeing troubling declines in per title sales of small press games?</blockquote>\nHey James: A couple things.<br/><br/>1) There is dilution going on... in this thread. :-)  It started off with a group-hug rant, and evolved and morphed into a gas giant of like 10 different simultaneous conversations and even flames. I'm not sure if there's anything less to squeeze out of it, here, almost 200+ posts later.<br/><br/>2) "You Folks". There's at least 5 separate people who publish for their living posting in this thread. Each of them have their own opinions and experiences. GMS is not Malcolm is not Chad is not Fred is not Ben Lehman, etc.  So could you perhaps specify who you are addressing so this doesn't turn into another "let's make general statements against an unintentional strawman, to which people think it applies to them and retort attacking an intentional strawman" thing?

I'm not seeing how this is the case for most of the "glut." A lot of it seems to be stuff that's thrown together from the stuff that the author was going to use anyway and he said, "hey I already wrote it as my house rules so why not charge people a few bucks for it." The only costs of doing something through Lulu or a pdf download site are layout and art, which disappear if you can do those yourself or get a friend to do them for you (especially if you're willing to accept crap quality, which I'm sure a lot of people are). Of course this is ignoring opportunity costs, but those don't really apply to people to write up games for the fun of it. So complaining about a glut of POD or PDF products is rather pointless since the costs are so low that there's really nothing to stop people from slapping something together out of their house rules and selling that. <br/><br/>Basically the old filtering mechanism for keeping out the crap worked like this:<br/>1. Really really bad games won't sell.<br/>2. If you game doesn't sell you'll lose money.<br/>3. If you keep on losing money you'll eventually give up.<br/>4. Really really bad games will go away and leave space for the good ones (or at least new bad games).<br/><br/>With POD and PDF that doesn't work anymore since no matter how badly your game sells there's no reason to EVER stop selling it since you don't have to pay for print runs anymore and you've already paid for layout and art. Basically keeping your old crappy game on the market costs nothing, so they never go away.<br/><br/>A good solution is something like Indie Press Revolution, since they vet books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111794/#Comment_111794" name="Item_253" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T21:42:15+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  9:42PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: JuddClint,<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you give this thread some context?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe've all gone bonzai, talking about the market this and lemonade stands that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happened?<br/>\n<br/>\nJudd<br/>\n<br/>\nFucked if I know, Judd.

That being said, my gaming work (freelance writing and game publishing) generates income that I require (in lieu of picking up a second job).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Are they seeing a glut in the market and do they think that sales would be up individually if there were just fewer games on the market? Or do they feel that a healthy and diverse hobby with multiple offerings sustains long term sales? Or are there other opinions?</blockquote>\nOver the course of this conversation, I have refined my thoughts and positions somewhat. <br/><br/>I am leaning towards thinking "glut" is for the most part value-neutral and is simply reflective of larger volume of products. Where glut is bad is in the narrow channels for (for-pay) distribution in this hobby industry -- increased volume leads to lower sales/attention for individual products across all participants in that volume. <br/><br/>That is the nature of the beast, however. If one wishes to operate as a business selling for-pay games, you've got to deal with that.<br/><br/>However, an increased number of undervalued for-pay products (produced under different axioms; "make a profit" vs. "make no profit" or even "take a loss") increases market volume unfairly. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>As a consumer of small press games, I don't feel overwhelmed by the number of product offerings or unable to get the information I need to make a buy decision.

Unfairly? What does that even mean? <br/><br/>What I <i>think</i> it means is "I'm trying to make a 'real' go of this business, and you cheapies are mucking it up for me with your 'fake' attempts at it."

Or at least how to phrase it.</blockquote>\nChad, this has been my disconnect with Malcolm's earlier posts about unfair business practices.  He has posted multiple times that the "standard practice" involves contributors being screwed, but when I think about the indie games people that form the bulk of game publishers on Story Games (the people I see at GenCon, at various booths and stopping by Games on Demand), I don't think they pursue those kinds of "standard practices."  But I really don't know how common they are in other roleplaying publishing communities.  For example, I have no clue about what standard practices are like on RPGnow or DriveThru.  The PDF publishing community is, in many ways, its own thing and many of the small press print publishers involved with IPR aren't closely involved with that community.  There are some exceptions, however.  But, overall, from the information that I have seen, I don't think that IPR's publishers underpay their contributors.<br/><br/>So when you, Malcolm, and GMS started talking about rampant unfair practices, I think a lot of people were scratching their heads or taking it as unfair accusations against us, because I don't think we see those kinds of practices from where we're standing and, since we're not closely tied into the PDF market (I sell PDFs through a PayPal button on my website, not even through IPR), don't know what's going on over there.  It's certainly news to me.<br/><br/>Now, if you want to talk about glut in the PDF market, I might be more inclined to agree with you, but I guess I assumed we were talking about the small press print market.  I do think that IPR's website is becoming more and more difficult to navigate as more new products get added to it, but I tend to think that's an organizational problem, not a problem with glut.  I don't think the print market currently has the glut issues that PDFs do, even with POD becoming an easily available tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111949/#Comment_111949" name="Item_271" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T09:36:55+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  9:36AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chad,<br/><br/>That seems like a bit of a poor analogy given the situation, here, though.  <br/><br/>The flood of cheap stuff here isn't being created by exploited workers who are unaware of market prices and unable to get better wages- for the most part, these are willing folks, hobbyists, who are quite happy to:<br/><br/>a) do it for free<br/>b) do it for beer money and maybe enough to kick into the next game<br/>c) do it with less people, more efficiently and get paid fair wages for freelance writing<br/><br/>People who consent to a level of work, for a level of compensation, in a situation where they can choose other means of getting 3 square meals a day, are not the same as the Nike sweatshop laborer in a "free trade zone" in Mexico.  <br/><br/>It also doesn't make sense to put small press games that are for profit in the same boat as someone trying to make a living wage- if they make $500 instead of $1000 this year, yeah, it happens, but it's not like babies are going unfed because of it.  And, if the small press market were to become completely unprofitable, based on the current business philosophy a lot of these folks are utilizing, they'd still be making games, just with less investment - they still wouldn't be at a loss.<br/><br/>Second, if your business' plan of exposure and continued sales relies upon curiosity sales over building a consistant customer base (whether through marketing, developing working channels, or simply word of mouth and quality), you're in trouble and with good reason- no market supports that in the long run, just in the same way craps doesn't make for a good source of annual income.<br/><br/>What I'm not getting here, is what part of this is "unfair"?  If folks who have their living wages staked on this business cannot figure out a way to compete against folks who have less experience, less resources, less name recognition, and possibly no business plan at all, either the whole industry is a crap shoot and it's insane to try to pull living wages from it or there is bad business planning on an epic scale.<br/><br/>What we do see with other areas that have also been blown open by hobbyist markets- like Youtube/Myspace to the music industry or flashgames to the videogame industry, is that there becomes a stratification based on quality, with some crossover, but not to the point that any one is driven completely out by the other.<br/><br/>I don't know, this line of thought seems more "sour grapes" to me than anything else.  Some new technology arrived, and people found alternate means of publishing and channels of distribution that were geometrically more efficient, and also applied business plans ("this is a hobby, not rent") that are keeping them in business.   Is it unfair?  I don't see why- now all the old players can take the knowledge that does cross over- design, layout, marketing, etc. and they have a lot of examples of people utilizing these things in better or worse ways as datapoints to pull from and apply themselves.<br/><br/>Instead of asking who deliberately operates at a loss in this game, maybe we need to ask who exactly is operating at a level to consistently earn living wages, and what, exactly, makes that possible.<br/><br/>(My wild guess is that it's companies who make more money selling novels rather than games.  I'd be interested to see what the 2nd tier publishers are doing as well though.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111953/#Comment_111953" name="Item_272" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T09:47:19+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  9:47AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2007 9:48AM by Christian_Griffen.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chadu</cite>Here's the way I see it: if it costs $10 to make Widget A (cost of goods, fair wage for all contributors) that retails for $20, and that's fairly a standard, ethical, fair cost/price, then what do you call someone (or their actions) who makes Widget B that costs $1 (because of slave labor, free materials, undervaluing personal), is directly compared to the first widget, and is retailed for $1? And note that 10 widget Bs can be made for every widget A.</blockquote>\nChad, I really respect you as a person and as a game designer. So I'm looking at this from the most positive light: you comparing us indie game producers to people who use slave labor in poverty-stricken countries must be just a bad analogy and not really meant in seriousness.<br/><br/>People who are used as slave labor, including wage slavery, have no choice about their work. It's do or die. I've studied slavery in the modern world somewhat; it's the result of a complex system in which poverty is so epidemic in some countries that people cannot escape slave labor or wage slavery (being kept in perpetual debt by their employer). Now, I've got an M.A. in Political Science and I'm very invested in social justice, so if you've got a forum where you'd like to talk about slavery and abuse of poverty in the world, I'm there.<br/><br/>People in the United States, including artists, are not in that position. They are no-fucking-where near it. They have choices. In the first place, they choose to pursue art instead of a different career. If they wanted to, they could make a living wage doing 100 other kinds of things. This country is filthy rich. YOU are filthy rich, compared with most of the rest of the world.<br/><br/>So: indie publishers do not enslave artists. They provide additional opportunities to the market of artists out there in this rich country. No one is forced to take it. No one's livelihood depends on it.<br/><br/>So let's cut the crap about all this "poor underpaid artists and slave laborers" bullshit and talk about the fact that cheap and free products make it harder for YOU to make the money you want to be making from your game publishing endeavors. If we can be honest about that, we can have a productive conversation. In fact, Ryan is trying to do just that, and his business wisdom shows through in each of his posts. You need to account for the market, for hobbyists doing their thing for cheap, and you need to adjust your business plan accordingly to get what you want out of it.<br/><br/>Nobody has any sort of right, based on fairness or ethics, to keep other people from producing and selling items at whatever price they decide to do it. To say otherwise in the absence of actually unethical practices (see REAL slave labor, above), is nonsense.<br/><br/>ETA: sorry about the dogpile, that was a crossposting issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111967/#Comment_111967" name="Item_273" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T10:16:33+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 10:16AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2007 10:35AM by Matt Snyder.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EDIT: Yeah, what Christian said (xenopulse). Cross posted with lots of people, it appears!<br/><br/>Chad, I think you're misreading me as accusing you of being insulting. That wasn't my aim. It's just how I type. I swear and act like a smart butt, and it's more about me sounding goofy than it is about me pissed off about yoU (I ain't, for the record). So, I was earnestly asking that stuff, not accusing. I see how you saw otherwise. No biggie.<br/><br/>Anyway. First, you gave an answer that unfair was more about selling stuff that should be $20 at something closer to $1. And, ok. But, I don't know anyone who's doing anything near that level of underpricing. KEEP IN MIND! One book shelf and RPGnow and all those guys? TOTALLY off my radar, personally. I sorta get the vibe that's where this crazy stuff happens, maybe? <br/><br/>So, sure, maybe some stuff like this happens there. I have very little idea of what goes on there. I'm on RPGnow as a publisher, and I hate it. I can't update a damn thing. The service I've received as a publisher is not just lousy, it's non-existent. I've sent emails that were plainly ignored, and I gave up. (Maybe they got spam-boxed or something; I dunno. I still gave up. They're still selling outdated versions of my games, and cutting checks that I can't cash. Thanks for nuttin'!)<br/><br/>MORE IMPORTANTLY! This thread is ugly. One of the ugliest issues, I think, is this: You and others have taken the position that paying, say, artists an "unfair" wage is unethical to the point of condemning it. Not, well, "I took some staplers from work," but "You're not paying someone who needs to eat, and shame on you!"<br/><br/>This has three problems. First, we have no idea who the heck you're talking about, if anyone. Instead, it's sort-of, kind-of described as people who "are just game designers" or people who "don't do things in business-fashion." Well, that describes a heck of a lot of people here who publish stuff. So, it's an awfully broad stroke to brush. But, it remains pretty ill-defined.<br/><br/>I don't see my colleagues (say, pals of mine on IPR) as breaching these ethical boundaries, assuming those boundaries should even exist. I don't see collegaues paying a lot of contributors, for one, nor do I see them treating those contributors unfairly for another.  And, I see these colleagues operating pretty ingeniously, albeit at a tidy, contained scope as a "business."<br/><br/>EDIT: FOrgot the second problem! The second problem is that there is no "fair" standard. Some have declared payments unfair. But, they aren't the arbiter of fair. They're aggrieved. One publisher's fair wage is another one's crime to humanity. There is no arbiter of fair. Which itself seems pretty unfair to me! It just leads to arguing.<br/><br/>EDIT: Forgot the third problem, which I've said previously. I don't owe a contributor a living. I just don't. They can take it or leave it. If they leave it, fine. I'll try to find someone else who is willing to do the creation for what *I* believe is fair, not what they require to pay rent.<br/><br/>So, I think you can see that I see a lot of "unfair!" being leveled like shot-gun blast, and it's muddying up the conversation like crazy. How bout some unfair laser beams instead?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111970/#Comment_111970" name="Item_274" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T10:23:47+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 10:23AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly, the same discussion is raging on the etsy.com boards where Lisa sells her crafts--many people who try to make a living at selling their crafts are bitterly complaining about the "damn hobbyists" who sell a quilt for $15 when it took them ten hours to make it, because that keeps the "professional crafters" from getting paid $80 for the same kind of item.

Okay, Chad, if that's your point, then I'm not sure what we can do to help, especially if you're mostly talking about the PDF market.  If people are making games that are considered comparable (in value) to your games, but are selling them for less because they aren't trying to make money... I can definitely see how that might cut into your sales.  But I guess I'm not sure what you can do about it, other than talking to them directly.<br/><br/>On a related note, I have heard small press print publishers talking about pricing in ways similar to what you're talking about.  Saying things like, "Well, if your book costs X amount for each copy, you should clearly sell your book for X+Y dollars, because doing otherwise is <i>devaluing all of indie rpgs for everyone</i>" (pissing in the pool basically).  I have a hard time knowing how to respond to that, honestly, because I don't publish Push (and people don't contribute to Push) in order to make money (though it does make money for both me and the other contributors) and it's priced at a point that we don't make that much off of each sale.  But, because other people have different business plans in mind (ones that involve a certain amount of income per book and, therefore, a certain sticker price), I should raise my prices?<br/><br/>That just seems against the spirit of indie publishing, honestly.  The whole reason I'm publishing it myself is so I can make all the important decisions about the product and conduct business however I want to conduct business.  Certainly, I will consider how my actions affect my fellow publishers, but that doesn't mean I will necessarily participate in pushing up the "standard sticker price" for an indie product, just so other publishers will feel better about the decision to charge X+Y for their products or get more sales because their products won't seem "overpriced" (one trait that is determined by consensus, I suppose).<br/><br/>I'm sorry that your sales are going down, perhaps due to hobbyist publishers, perhaps due to folks who are taking advantage of their contributors to keep prices low.  Those seem like two different problems, however.  But, as a hobbyist publisher with very different priorities, I'm not sure what I can do to help you (or folks in the small press print scene that feel similarly) without destroying my own "business plan" and enjoyment as a hobbyist publisher.  I do this because I love doing it and to do otherwise would mean losing a lot of that love.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112015/#Comment_112015" name="Item_289" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T11:26:31+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 11:26AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2007 12:31PM by Adam_Dray.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm seeing a handful of issues here, all getting conflated.<br/><br/><b>Capitalism</b><br/>People set prices according to supply and demand and what they think the labor and final goods are worth. It's Econ 101 stuff. It's all <i>fair</i>, given that everyone has the same opportunities. <br/><br/>In the case of game publishing, we all have the same opportunities -- indie and industry. Whether we use those profits for rent or for beer, it's money in our pocket. <br/><br/><b>Hobby or Profession?</b><br/>I can't tell the difference. Chad works a day job and then does RPG freelance stuff. He says he needs that money to pay bills, and this makes him a "professional game designer." <b>[Edit: Chad said he needs money to pay bills, but didn't say that it made him a pro. The quotes were not his. Sorry for any confusion.]</b> If his day job paid more (covered all his family's needs), would he consider himself a hobbyist game designer? If Vincent makes more money selling his games than Chad makes selling his, is Vincent a professional, too? <br/><br/>In the end, I find the distinction pretty meaningless. If you do it for money, you're a professional. If you do it for free, you're a hobbyist.<br/><br/><b>Fairness</b><br/>If you're a publisher that is exploiting people, I can see that it's a problem and I agree you're not competing fairly. People can sell their labor for whatever they like. <br/><br/>I don't pay myself for the writing (and rewriting) I did on Verge. When I publish it, I hope to break even; better, I hope to make a little profit so I can afford to publish my next project. I want to pay artists and editors what they're worth but, the fact is, I can't afford to. I found some new artists and offered them advertising space in the back of my game instead of money. I now have a moral obligation to get that game published so I can repay them for their time and talent. I am basically begging friends to do editing and layout for me, or I'll have to do it myself.<br/><br/>Does this mean I'm not fairly competing with other publishers who pay artists and editors market rate? I don't think so. I spend way more time than they do trying to find people who can do this stuff for me on the cheap, or for free. My labor is my cost, and I pay myself nothing. <br/><br/>Is paying myself nothing "fair"? Sure. My labor is worth what I feel it's worth. I am doing what I love. I am sure that Chad loves what he does, too. He just takes it more seriously than I do, so he can eat. <br/><br/>Will my products take money out of Chad's hands? Maybe. I hope not, but it's a reality I have to face. Is it unfair if it does? Why should it be? If I am willing to spend my time to write and publish my game for less than he will do it, then that's the value of my game to me.

He has posted multiple times that the "standard practice" involves contributors being screwed, but when I think about the indie games people that form the bulk of game publishers on Story Games (the people I see at GenCon, at various booths and stopping by Games on Demand), I don't think they pursue those kinds of "standard practices." But I really don't know how common they are in other roleplaying publishing communities. For example, I have no clue about what standard practices are like on RPGnow or DriveThru. The PDF publishing community is, in many ways, its own thing and many of the small press print publishers involved with IPR aren't closely involved with that community. There are some exceptions, however. But, overall, from the information that I have seen, I don't think that IPR's publishers underpay their contributors.</blockquote>\nWell, Jonathan, there's an obvious disconnect between your claim that this doesn't happen in the community and the fact that people *in* this community, *in* this thread are arguing that they should be able to do that which apparently never happens.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Adam Dray</cite>Capitalism<br/>People set prices according to supply and demand and what they think the labor and final goods are worth. It's Econ 101 stuff. It's all fair, given that everyone has the same opportunities. <br/><br/>In the case of game publishing, we all have the same opportunities -- indie and industry. Whether we use those profits for rent or for beer, it's money in our pocket</blockquote>\nAside from the fact that the pocket money thing has evidently not been the case (publishers who couldn't afford Gen Con unless they made sales *at* Gen Con) this reminds me of the time one of my profs asked this question:<br/><br/>"If you could press a button that made everyone equally poor or one that made everyone equally wealthy, which one would you press?"<br/><br/>You had some wags talk about how it would all be the same thing.

Artists who agree to work for less than $100/page are consenting. They can say no to the price. <br/><br/>If I offer Jennifer half of what she usually charges for a cover -- or if I ask her to do it for me for free, even -- then she will say no. If she says yes, then I'll be beside myself with joy that I can afford her talent, and I'll have a spiffy cover or whatever. It's her choice. It's not freaking exploitive.

Artists who agree to work for less than $100/page are consenting. They can say no to the price.<br/><br/>If I offer Jennifer half of what she usually charges for a cover -- or if I ask her to do it for me for free, even -- then she will say no. If she says yes, then I'll be beside myself with joy that I can afford her talent, and I'll have a spiffy cover or whatever. It's her choice. It's not freaking exploitive. How is this abuse?<br/><br/>Consent is what happens when people are able to make a choice without pressure from surrounding social arrangements. A community that devalues an artist work is just that pressure. By making your argument you are in fact continuing that pressure, contributing to it and reducing opportunities for real consent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112097/#Comment_112097" name="Item_311" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T13:49:45+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  1:49PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>Malcolm, you're still dodging the central issue.

They should at the least be paid minimum wage. Maybe they should even unionize.<br/><br/>Fuck, maybe artists should unionize. Then they can counter the social environment that keeps the rates low.<br/><br/>But absent that, exactly because of self-employment and the freedom you're gaining from it, you need to take the risks that come with it. As someone who's looked into self-employment quite a bit during the last year, that's just the way it looks to me.<br/><br/>ETA: In case this didn't come through, freelancers should ALSO be paid at least minimum wage.

You believe that because you spent some trivial amount of time moving furniture with Mere Proles you're Down With Labour. But your pretention, despite its funny "But my Best Friends Were X" flavour, really has no fucking standing at all. Artists have appeared on this thread and told you that your time assessment is wrong, so anything that proceeds from your patently stupid assumption is similarly wrong.<br/><br/>I don't believe I'm special -- merely that you're fucked up. It so happens that I'm right by a number of real indicators, and your abstract "Lo the Market" benchmark is typical cheap labour conservative bullshit.<br/><br/>Also, I'm glad to hear that the union ripped you off. In retrospect, you deserved it. Anyone who has a decent union of course knows how it benefits them, though they aren't perfect, and anyone with an understanding of the history of labour knows that organized labour movements are responsible for the protections so many of us, union or not, enjoy today.<br/><br/>That's why cheap labor conservative like yourself are reduced to ripping off a smaller and smaller set of people. We keep pushing back. You keep looking for for a smaller number of people to bully, as you weaken.<br/><br/>Anyway, I suppose I'm done. People can either join me in the gay liberal conspiracy to pay people better than shit and approach production in the hobby with a modicum of social responsibility, or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112195/#Comment_112195" name="Item_341" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T16:10:55+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  4:10PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I already called for a higher minimum wage.

I'm sorry if your desire to corral the conversation with a leading question was stymied.</blockquote>\nIt's a fairly straightforward question, Malcolm. Since you apparently lack any sort of real-world experience with the subject, I'll offer some to you.<br/><br/>As an employer, I am competing for talent. If I offer some ridiculous shit wage, I can't get employees who can fulfill my needs because they're in short supply at that pay rate. So I keep upping my offered rate until I break that threshold: I get the talent I need at the lowest rate the employee will tolerate. I trust my employees to know what it costs to keep a roof over their own heads. It cannot be my responsibility to second-guess their needs, because there's an inherent conflict of interest in that. It would be, in a phrase you so gleefully toss around, <i>immoral</i> for me to interfere with the success of my company (which includes me and many other employees) by doing so.<br/><br/>When it comes to artists and writers in the RPG business -- and, yes, Malcolm, you and I have worked for some of the same clients -- you find absurdly low rates of pay for all levels of work. When I finally left the business, I had topped out at about $0.35/word. My very next job, freelancing at a magazine, started me at $1/word and went up from there. $250 for painted cover art was not unusual; $10-20 per quarter-page filler art as well.<br/><br/>Rates in the RPG business are low because the supply greatly outstrips the demand. It's the simplest math in the world. Employers in the RPG business are faced with exactly the same choices that I am: how do you get the talent you need at the lowest possible rate? You start as low as you can. If you get satisfactory work at that rate, then you've found your rate. If it's unsatisfactory for any reason (substandard quality, missed deadlines, pissy attitude), pay more until you find the talent.<br/><br/>The problem, Malcolm, isn't the publishers. <i>It's the consumers</i>. As long as consumers of RPG products continue to tolerate the current level of writing, editing, artwork, production, design, etc, there's no motive for anyone anywhere to change anything. Consumers have proven time and time again that they're willing to pay for art that only cost the publisher $20. They continue to gleefully spend money for supplements that cost the publisher a dime a word to write.<br/><br/>It's always sad to see political ideology bump up against the real world, Malcolm, but your whole premise is beyond absurd. It's infantile.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112210/#Comment_112210" name="Item_344" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T16:33:38+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  4:33PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm wondering:<br/><br/>Let's say that right now we have people working as artists that can get enough work for 1 B&amp;W page per day.
