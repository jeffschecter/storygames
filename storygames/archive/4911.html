Even if there is no GM, these responsibilities need to rotate or be distributed among the players for roleplaying to be possible.</blockquote>\nHere's how I unpack it:<br/><br/><b>What Are the GM's Responsibilities in Play?</b><br/><br/>I'm not going to focus on these two...<br/><br/>- Authority Over Rules Disputes<br/>- Make Sure Play is Fun<br/><br/>...because they are pretty easy to distribute collectively, assuming people get along fairly well.  Instead I'm going to focus on the GM responsibilities that are explicitly distributed in <i>Polaris</i>, which I think makes a good baseline.  These are:<br/><br/>- Provide Antagonism<br/>- Play NPCs<br/>- Scene Framing (or just general narrative description if there is no explicit scene framing)<br/><br/>Have I missed any?<br/><br/><b>Rotating and Distributing These Responsibilities</b><br/><br/>I think it's pretty easy to get a handle on how a single rotating GM role works (Rune!) or how these responsibilities might be broken up and rotated between players (like the different player roles in <i>Polaris</i>).  Emily talked a bunch about methods for distributing and rotating responsibilities in her article for Push 1, but I don't think she explicitly went into situations where responsibilities are collectively held and negotiated in a freeform style.  A good example might be stakes setting in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, where one player says, "How about X stakes?" another says, "Well, what about Y instead?" and a third says, "Can we just do Y+1?"  Eventually everyone agrees on stakes, even though you don't have explicit negotiation rules like the ritual phrases in <i>Polaris</i>.<br/><br/>Everyone good on that?  Rotation of responsibilities, distributing responsibilities, and informally sharing responsibilities between multiple players?  Yeah?  This is how most games do it, yes?<br/><br/><b>Killing a Sub-Cow: Providing Antagonism</b><br/><br/>ASSUMPTION: The characters / players need external antagonism for play to be interesting.<br/><br/>DEATH #1: Let the characters provide all the antagonism they need, targeting each other, as in many larps or parlor games.  Make the main "bad guys" PCs or avoid having explicit "bad guys" and have characters with different, incompatible goals or assumptions crash into each other.  See, like, all of modern theatre and cinema (especially the Traffic, Crash, Babel, Heroes school of parallel narratives).  I don't really see this as distributed / rotating responsibility for antagonism, because it's not like, "Hey Jonathan, it's your turn to describe a complication!" or "Okay, I control the orks, so they jump out of the bushes at you!"  This makes antagonism just something characters do naturally, instead of something you have to force or talk about.  It just becomes _good roleplaying_.  You may not even need mechanical stuff to support it.<br/><br/>DEATH #2: Fuck antagonism, go with puzzles.  There are so many other ways to structure play rather than making all conflicts in the game be represented, outside the fiction, by conflicts between players with different narrative tools (characters, resources, dicepools) at their disposal.  What if you have a game where everything really does have a fixed difficulty, like a heist movie game.  During Stage 3 of the heist, you always have to roll a 12 or higher.  That's it.  The game provides antagonism for you.  Or look at stuff like House on the Hill or abstract German board games.  Puzzles make great challenges without needing players to embody and represent them.<br/><br/>DEATH #3: Fuck antagonism, make a game that's not about conflict.  This one is harder for me to think about.  So much of our media revolves around conflict and there's an inherent tendency to want to simulate the conflict in rules.  But, you know, maybe conflict isn't what your story is really about.  Say you're running a buddy cop game where people get shot at and maybe even one of the cops dies.  That's all cool, but... maybe the game is about the relationship that develops between these two cops, and all the mechanics are focused on that.  Maybe the conflicts that happen in the game are just color, y'know?<br/><br/>I'll break down NPCs and Scene Framing in a bit, but let me know what you think so far.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110116/#Comment_110116" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T14:01:56+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  2:01PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your Death <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is golden, shining, truth.

Also, Universalis, though the structuring of play in that case happens during play, not before it.  There's also things like "clan burning" in The Blossoms Are Falling (collaboratively creating a relationship map and deciding other things as a group) or the establishment of the questions that will be answered during the campaign in Bliss Stage.

I can certainly imagine a story without much in the way of antagonism, but I have difficulty imagining a story, or a game, where there's no conflict in the broad sense of the term - namely, wanting to achieve something in spite of some kind of adversity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we look at stories, or games based on stories, they're generally built out of something like a "scene."  And characters enter a scene with expectations of some kind.  Those expectations are met or denied, and the characters feel happy or sad about that, and the characters which recur may end up taking action as a result of that outcome.  And somewhere out of that iterative process, there's a story.  It could very well be a soliloquy, as someone wrestles with the meaning of inconvenient facts - but I think if you start out with "human desire" + "embedded in Time", there's going to be problems either internally or externally.  And how those problems get resolved is going to be a key part of your story, both in terms of plot and "meaning."<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying it can't be done, but I want to see a really clear counter-example, or at least more tightly defined terms on this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Okay, I actually could maybe see how this would work: the RPG consists of short lists of scenes where every plot-significant event is defined, and key dialogue exchanges are given in advance, and what happens is pretty strictly set in stone.  What's not clear is <i>why</i> it happens.  So, the challenge of the game is for the players to think up increasingly cool, or twisted, or touching explanations for what happens in the storyline - the game ends up being about acting, rather than writing, if that makes any sense.  (Of course, at that point you might as well just buy the text of a one-act play and stage it yourselves, but maybe there'd be rules on this somehow.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110187/#Comment_110187" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T21:40:35+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  9:40PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2007 10:04PM by Eric.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>I'm curious what you mean by <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> - a game not "about conflict".  I can certainly imagine a story without much in the way of antagonism, but I have difficulty imagining a story, or a game, where there's no conflict in the broad sense of the term - namely, wanting to achieve something in spite of some kind of adversity.</blockquote>\n"My Neighbor Totoro." The notion of someone trying to achieve something in spite of adversity does not form the center of that plot in any sense that I can think of. <br><br>"Azumanga Daioh" is extremely conflict-light. An episode might be structured as much around Osaka's weird dreams as anyone working for anything.<br><br>"Ranma 1/2" frequently fails to have the title character wanting to achieve something other than not getting killed, beaten, or married off. There's lots of adversity, but slapstick comedy often substitutes for motivation.<br><br>"Kikujiro" is nominally about a kid trying to find his mom for the first half, and... enjoying summer vacation for the second? I'm not sure, and you could probably chart out some sort of overcoming-adversity narrative, but it's weak.<br/><br/>A lot of Film Noir shows people trying to overcome adversity, but only as a pretext for the real stories of obsession, fatalism, and evil. So, while you can read a conflict-based narrative into it, the fact that Noir worlds are often completely deterministic tends to undermine that reading.<br/><br/>Anyway, conflict can easily be a sideshow to the big show, and can completely removed in all practical sense while maintaining a compelling story.<br/><br/>Edit: A lot of Japanese films that my wife and I enjoy don't have conflict-based plots as we typically see them on U.S. prime-time T.V. If the story is, say, about learning about yourself, and you don't actually have any serious issues that prevent this - that is, you're simply watching someone do something with nothing pushing back against them - then it seems like reading an adversity-based structure into it is shoehorning it into something that doesn't fit.<br/><br/>There's lot's of surrealist and absurdist stuff that is based around the sheer experience of a thing rather than any conflict a person might have with it. I have a book of short stories by Kurahashi Yumiko that I read as part of a group project in a lit class a few years back. Each group presented a different work, along with analysis, to the class. We did ours via crayon illustrations, because a story about a cat fucking a dude, with long paragraphs describing the contortions of their bodies, can't really be summed up in any other way. Ditto for a story about two people talking about how much a flower looks like vagina if you zoom in on them both.<br/><br/>Also, "Pinball 1973" by Haruki Murakami.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110189/#Comment_110189" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T21:56:41+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  9:56PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Death <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> but not all players want a "competetive" environment.  There are many play styles that are still story games that ask that the characters and players work together.  I ran a Star Wars game recently where character antagonism was out in the open (among players, not among characters) and some people were getting a little squirrelly.  I love it but not everyone does and not all the time.  I like Rob's Misspent Youth rules where the fight is always with the GM/Authority.<br/><br/>Death <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> I desperately want to design and try.

I mean if the movie is about the relationship between the cops then the conflict isn't the bad guys shooting at them (which is just color) rather it's the conflicts between them and their divergent points of view.  I tend to think conflcit is central and without conflict you RARELY have drama.  Sure you could tell a story about how everything is going swimingly but I am uncertain how entertaining that wound be, especially over the long haul.

Nobody is testing any opinions or exploring metaphysical contradictions or social forces or anything of the sort.  There are huge crazy furry things, but they're all friendly and nobody is afraid of them. Mom's sick, that's why they're out in the country, but it's not at all a problem or a source of anxiety until it motivates Mei to go off to visit her by herself, which motivates Satsuki to get Totoro's help to find Mei. <br/><br/>You watch kids explore a fundamentally positive, happy, and wondrous world. There is a dialectic process here to the bare extent that we the audience are reminded of the magic and joy of the world, and it might be assumed that the audience is sufficiently jaded to not see the world that way to begin with. The story itself doesn't show that opposing view at all, however. When morning comes and the great tree that was conjured from the earth has become a seeding, the reaction is "wow, look at how much we made it grow!" <br/><br/>There is certainly a mode of classical analysis that tells me that those dialectical elements - showing a certain mode of life and action <i>in opposition</i> to other known but unpresented possibilities - constitute the fundamental story. I find that critical perspective to be so far removed from the story I see on the screen in this case, however, that it seems useless and hollow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110230/#Comment_110230" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T06:32:47+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  6:32AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2007 6:41AM by J_Walton.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Claudia's Jeepform example and Christian's comments about freeform / fanfic is really right on the money.<br/><br/>I can see what you're saying, Malcolm (and Don), about all stories needing conflict of some variety, like the girl looking for her lost sister in My Neighbor Totoro.  That problem could be seen as a conflict that the characters are working to resolve.  However, what I said is not that the story would have "no conflict," but that the conflicts are not what the story is ABOUT.  They are not the key focus the way they are in most roleplaying games.  You don't need to have a system for resolving them or anyone assigned to provide an antagonistic role because that's not really all that important.  <br/><br/>I don't think this is just throwing a sheet over conflict and pretending it's not there while we whistle past it.  It could be because we're genuinely interested in other things, like exploring themes or character development, and don't really care how the conflict resolves.  I think a movie like The Fountain is a great example.  Or the first part of 2001: A Space Odyssey (before the conflict with Hal), with the monkeys and the business people in space.  Is it really interesting to us which monkeys win the waterhole?  Do we really care whether the businessman impresses his friends or is able to hide his real motivations for going to the moon?  No, not really.  Those are not interesting conflicts.  But we are still interested in exploring what happens, so we focus on things other than conflict.  Like, wow that monkey's really acting crazy.  Or, sweet, let's have people, like, walk on the ceiling and stuff, because they're in SPACE!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110237/#Comment_110237" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T06:56:42+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  6:56AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before I get into the other sub-cows, I just want to say that you don't have to kill all these sub-cows in order to kill the cow.  Games work fine with various sub-cows alive or dead.  Just because you want to, say, kill the NPC cow, doesn't mean that you can't have a GM or rotate responsibilities in regards to other things.<br/><br/><b>Killing a Sub-Cow: Playing NPCs</b><br/><br/>ASSUMPTION: We should interact with characters who are not represented by fellow players and we need someone "outside" to play them.<br/><br/>DEATH #4: No NPCs; it's a small world. The players are trapped in a lifeboat or work in the same office everyday (and we never really see their lives outside the office, because that's not what the game is about). The sharks or office clients are a puzzle or an uninteresting conflict (see above), not NPCs.<br/><br/>DEATH #5: No NPCs, just PCs.  Hey, it's troupe-style <i>Ars Magicka</i>.  There are no NPCs because all the characters are distributed among the players and the characters who are primary at any given moment are the ones play focuses on.  Every character is a PC.  GM-less Primetime Adventures falls in this category.  Troupe-style dungeon crawls would be really interesting, I think, with giant spiders and gelatinous cubes as PCs.  It would be hard for it to not be pure comedy, though (and I'm not sure I'd use D&amp;D, since it's not really built for that, maybe PTA).<br/><br/>Note, if you combine Deaths <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, 4, &amp; 5, you get a lot of parlor larps, like murder mysteries or White Wolf's Long Live the King (though that has mechanically driven antagonism).<br/><br/>There may be other options here for killing NPCs, but those are the two obvious ones I see.

They're created by the narrative -- and the narrative uses conflict as the vehicle. Neo kicking 50 Smiths in the face isn't a conflict, it's a moment in the narrative that's been *generated* by conflict.<br/><br/>In RPGs it's easy to get confused at this point because we so often define conflict in the context of violence, and mapping violence as an interpersonal thing. Games like DitV demonstrate that this isn't necessary. But even in a conventional game, the conflict generates loose scenes -- dice rolls set its content by seeing how individual tasks play out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110614/#Comment_110614" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T07:55:16+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  7:55AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm, I just posted <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4926&amp;page=1#Item_16" rel="nofollow">an example scene that's not about conflict</a> over in that other thread (though the scene has conflicts happening around it).  Does that help explain what I'm trying to say here?  I'm not saying, in the play style I'm positing, there's no conflict in the narrative at all, I'm just saying that we -- as players -- don't really care about the outcome of the conflict or how the conflict unravels.  It's a tree falling in the forest with no one there to hear it.  Does it make a sound?  How does it fall?  We don't care.  Maybe we don't even know.  For example, in the scene I posted, the players are more interested in exploring little cool descriptive bits of the setting.  They don't care about how the battle with the aliens goes.  They care if the aliens' spaceships have cool manta ray tails.<br/><br/><b>Killing a Sub-Cow: Scene Framing</b><br/><br/><b>ASSUMPTION:</b> A single player needs to have responsibility for describing the general environment, what's happening, and keeping track of things like pacing, the amount of time passing in-game, prompting players with "What do you do?" questions, and deciding when a scene is over or we need to move on to another thing.  This role can rotate -- with a new player for each scene -- or be split up -- one player frames scenes, another calls "cut" -- but these responsibilities are critical.<br/><br/>DEATH <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a> (for Cydmab): Fixed scenes.  The Mountain Witch, The Shab-Al-Hiri Roach, Burning Empires, Grey Ranks, and Bliss Stage all have scenes that are tightly defined by certain criteria (there are probably other games like this as well).  Of these, Jason's games (Grey Ranks, Roach) are the most explicit in not really requiring a GM to frame them.  They are like "X event is happening; Y character and Z character are there; go!"  Also, the event in question has a fixed time limit and expires when the event is over.  The Winter Social starts in the evening and ends at the time at which a Winter Social would probably end.  There's some flexibility there, but basically everyone has a pretty good sense of the boundaries of a scene.<br/><br/>DEATH #7: Scenes?  What scenes?  Play doesn't stop.  It isn't broken into scenes by players calling "start" and "stop."  You just start and it goes.  Players narrate characters wandering in and out of various locations, doing a variety of things.  A lot of larps work like this.  Maybe, every so often, the mechanics require players to draw a card and narrate some special event happening (basically a fixed scene from Death #6), but otherwise play keeps going until some end state is reached.  You could also have mechanical things, in a tabletop version, that force the "camera" to shift to another location and set of characters.  In <i>Transantiago</i> this is characters getting on a subway train and changing location, but there could be many other methods.<br/><br/>Other deaths I'm missing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
