Despite this, we always aim for professional production quality in what we do. Our approach to convention organization, focusing on the actual gaming and taking an active approach to polishing each event on our roster to maximize the play experience, has been extremely well-received by our attendees and is a big factor in our pretty rapid growth curve.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Cthulhu Cup:</b> The tournament is a multi-table event where several groups of investigators play through an original scenario set in the Cthulhu mythos, competing with the other teams to find and draw conclusions from clues, advancing the plot, characterizing "in-character", "in-theme", and "in-period", and creating the most enjoyable play experience for the table. The winning team's participants receives a prize package and the Cthulhu Cup.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write an original scenario based around traditional CoC investigation activities, written for a convention format (roughly 3-4 hours in length) with highly entertaining and interesting characters. The writer we select to write this scenario for us will get full writer's credit and shared copyright to the edited text, a copy of their printed and bound scenario, and an honourarium of $100 CAD.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe want a scenario in which anyone can participate in regardless of their prior experience with the Mythos or Mythos-based games. The ruleset you use should ideally be either Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu 6th edition, Graham Walmsley's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://catchyourhare.com/files/Cthulhu%20Dark.pdf" rel="nofollow">Cthulhu Dark</a>, or some other well-known, ubiquitous and/or easy to learn ruleset. We prefer a Purist scenario over Pulp (but also prefer an excellent Pulp scenario over a mediocre Purist one).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe'd need your synopsis by August 28th at the latest, from which we'll pick our writer and notify by September 4th. Your final manuscript would be due on October 10th.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe'd like to make the scenario available under a Creative Commons International Share-Alike Attribution license.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're interested in writing for us or have any questions, please email <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="mailto:events@hammercon.ca" rel="nofollow">events@hammercon.ca</a> for more details or comment in this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're interested in attending, please visit <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.hammercon.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.hammercon.ca</a> for more details, newsletter and signup info.

The ruleset is very minimal and easy to teach / use, and therefore very suitable for a convention game with time constraints. Some of its rules also invoke themes that seem more Purist (in terms of actual Lovecraft literature) than good ol' Call of Cthulhu. Of course, the increased degree of player authorship I'm perceiving in the system means that certain types of pre-written scenario triggers aren't going to work quite right, so it seems to me that the scenario actually has to be written explicitly for Cthulhu Dark in order to work with it without relying on the Keeper drifting the scenario. Obviously, Keeper drifting is something we want to avoid as much as possible given the competitive nature of a tournament game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd be overjoyed if you submitted a proposal this year, Graham (hint hint!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338302/#Comment_338302" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T14:44:48+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  2:44PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>...it seems to me that the scenario actually has to be written explicitly for Cthulhu Dark in order to work with it without relying on the Keeper drifting the scenario.</blockquote>. Not really! There's still plenty of room for the GM or the scenario to throw up constraints, just like in BRP. The only things to keep an eye on are (1) the deadliness of pushing on rolls until you get a success - CD investigators will not endure too many three-dice rolls, and (2) the fact that you never get to fight monsters, which shouldn't be a problem in a Purist framework anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chroma" title="Chroma"><img alt="Chroma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/n1N2ZVK30JJ00.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chroma">Chroma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338317/#Comment_338317" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T16:40:54+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  4:40PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd consider writing something, but I'm on the defending team from last year... the Cthulhu Cup is staring at me even as I type this... <i>AIEEEEEE!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338323/#Comment_338323" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T17:03:10+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  5:03PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and - like last year - you're looking for 1920s scenarios, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338324/#Comment_338324" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T17:08:25+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  5:08PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2011 5:09PM by lachek.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Oh, and - like last year - you're looking for 1920s scenarios, right?</blockquote>\nNah, you know what?
