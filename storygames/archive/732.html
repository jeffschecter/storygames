                            All of my games are an effort to prove something.  I don't write games that I am already capable of writing when I begin designing.  Instead, I come up with a really exciting theory that I'd like to see enacted in roleplaying, something that I don't know how to do already, and I use the design process as a kind of "proof" attempt, figuring out how to make something work that wasn't obviously possible before.  Whether you view this as a "proof" or just a demonstration of a theory kinda depends on how you're using the word "theory" (Chris Lehrich has a great article on the multiple meanings of "theory" and their applicability to roleplaying, but I can't find it right now).<br/><br/>Often times, the bits of theory I try to prove are derrived from the reading I'm currently doing, whether it's in small group communication theory or the development of arthouse wuxia as a cinematic genre.  But they're usually sparked by something outside roleplaying (or at least comes from another branch of roleplaying, like interactive fiction or collaborative fiction writing).  For example, my more recent projects set out to demonstrate the following:<br/><br/><a href="http://100flowers.indie-rpgs.com/trimet.htm" rel="nofollow">Heavenly Kingdoms</a> (Game Chef 2005, finished late)<br/>- players create "what happens" simply by improvizing upon and remixing a fixed text<br/>- players have a sense of character that's not formalized in any mechanical way<br/><br/><i>Untitled Arthouse Wuxia Game</i> (planned for Push vol 1, unfinished)<br/>- frame scenes on the super-micro level, image by image, shot by shot<br/>- create inter-character conflict without having it be driven by inter-player conflict<br/>- do a martial art game that doesn't require people to geek out over the mechanics<br/><br/><a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2005/12/i-digress-lions-on-precipice.html" rel="nofollow">Lions on the Precipice</a> (my <i>Dogs</i> remix, unfinished)<br/>- have a multiple-PC game where the main characters never meet<br/>- structure play so that different characters' actions comment on each other thematically<br/><br/><a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/01/kazekami-kyoko-kills-kublai-khan.html" rel="nofollow">Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan</a> (lesbianstripperninja, Jan 2006)<br/>- further explanation of semi-mechanical characterization<br/>- have different characters play by different rules<br/>- structure player input as a way to guide "what happens"<br/><br/><a href="http://100flowers.indie-rpgs.com/waiting-tea.pdf" rel="nofollow">Waiting for the Queen/Tea at Midnight</a> (Push vol 1)<br/>- enable interactive fiction ("get lamp") style play in tabletop<br/>- more semi-mechanical characterization, but also allowing for freeform characterization<br/>- focus on the difference between mechanically supported/unsupported play<br/>- a different approach to structuring player input<br/><br/><a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/ftopic629.html" rel="nofollow">When The Forms Exhaust Their Variety</a> (Game Chef 2006, unfinished)<br/>- move away from traditional narrative structure<br/>- do tabletop play that's not really "storytelling," more like larp multiplicity<br/>- mechanically require player co-dependency<br/>- be as weird and out-there as possible <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/05/pirate-game.html" rel="nofollow">The Good Ship Revenge</a> (current project, unfinished)<br/>- handle a variable number of players in a fixed-character game<br/>- use a collaborative fiction (online freeform) style narrative authority scheme<br/>- frame scenes at a more micro level, with individual images ("shots"), like a movie<br/>- create a short game that supports play of variable length<br/><br/><a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/05/summer-fun-game-chef.html" rel="nofollow">Untitled Dolphin Game</a> (upcoming Summer Fun Game Chef 2006)<br/>- question traditional assumptions about the communication and content of play<br/>- be as weird and out-there as possible <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I've written a couple of articles on roleplaying, but none have been published professionally as of yet, so I won't comment on the latter question.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> Forgot two projects.  Also, I think I learn as much (or more) from games I never finish as those that I do.  Even failed or abandoned projects are a chance to learn a lot.

                            My experience with game theory was in college. I got a mathematics degree and focused chiefly on game theory and symbolic logic. <br/>
<br/>
I have never found an application for game theory in RPGs other than in the systemization of payoffs and choices - and even that's of minimal use since the choices facing participants in RPGs are so numerous and difficult to quantify.<br/>
<br/>
Note that I am talking about the established, recognized game theory that is a branch of mathematics, not "gaming theory" like GNS, GDS, the Big Model, etc.                        </div>

                            I think game theory's applicability to RPGs in general is limited, as people often aren't playing to win as such - they're playing to make things interesting.                        </div>

                            To some degree you can get more mileage out of game theory by limiting the "meaningful" choices within a system. The game that springs to mind for me (not being familiar with either of the games in your blog post) is My Life With Master.  There is not much "choice" in MLWM in the game-theoretic sense. You can dress it up in whatever flashy description you want but either you're going to submit or resist. <br/>
<br/>
Julian has an excellent point, and it's one that lies at the core of attempting to apply game theory to any situation.  You must define the payoff accurately in order to be able to perform any kind of evaluation. <br/>
<br/>
In other words, in D&amp;D we might define the payoff as "the amount of gold pieces the party collects in toto" and look at defined individual decisions insofar as they increase or decrease the amount of gold pieces the party collects.  This will present a much different payoff from a payoff in which "the group reaches the final encounter with the Big Boss with enough resources to give him a reasonable fight" is what we're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Again note that we must define the decision point.  Choosing a longsword-fighter over a two-dagger rogue-ranger character generation build involves literally dozens of decisions, which makes it impossible to say anything cogent about them game-theoretically.  However, if we make "selecting a character build" as a decision point, and define broad choices within that decision point, then we miss a lot of detail.  (Some of which may be controlling detail to different players - "I like the rogue because he is sneaky" is different from "I like the rogue because I like the sneak attack bonus" and at a certain degree of granularity, both of these are the same decision. Indeed, at a certain degree of granularity, both of these are the same decision as "I like the fighter because of his hitpoints." Not the same sort of decision - the same decision.)<br/>
<br/>
In other words, both game theory and RPGs are far too broad to say anything about them in conjunction without narrowing your definitions to determine exactly what you want to do.<br/>
<br/>
To some degree, every single mechanic in every single game ever written is a game-theoretic thing and when we think about mechanics, everything we think about is game theory, but that's not that helpful either.<br/>
<br/>
I guess if I were to want to apply some form of semi-pro game theory to gaming I would want to know what I was looking for - in other words, give me a block of gaming-related data, ask "what do we want to learn from this data" and "what data do we consider cogent to this question", then we can maybe get somewhere.                        </div>

                            As a professional I use game theory, usually for algorithm analysis. I've also applied it to RPGs in my PCon3 theory. PCon3 implies that RPGs are mixed cooperative / competative game where the optimization function is instantaneous and uncomputable. For more details take a look at my views thread.<br/><br/>As far as more conventional uses of game theory, I wrote a RPGnet <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/physics31oct03.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> on that some time ago.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should <br/>not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such <br/>things.</a> </div>
