One of them killed the president of the club and everyone has to sort out who did it (ie pin clues on everyone else) before the police arrive.<br><br><i>"When the grand Blennerhassett Hotel first opened its doors in the late 1800s, a special room was commissioned by Bernard Brunheimer, a wealthy local businessman who had great influence within the City of Parkersburg. Brunheimer asked that a room be set aside for use by his wife, Charlotte Brunheimer, and her circle of friends, collectively known as The Red Rose Society. The social group represented some of the most prominent and wealthy women in the Mid-Ohio Valley, and rumor held that Mr. Brunheimer bequeathed a portion of his estate to the hotel\u2019s owner, ensuring the room would remain in the Society\u2019s care for years to come.<br><br>Members of The Red Rose Society met once a month to discuss their loves, their lives and their loses. The chamber where they met became known as The Red Rose Room. So as to preserve its purpose and integrity, keys to the room were given only to members of the Society and no other copies were made. As a Society member grew old and passed away, the original key would be handed down to a new member upon approval of the remaining members, and one among their group would be elected as Society president, a person to watch over the social club to make sure its membership remained selective and exclusive.<br/><br/>Now, nearly 70 years after the establishment of The Red Rose Society, the six of you are all that remains of the once storied club. Well, the five of you, really. After all, lying on the floor in the middle of the Rose Room, cold and unmoving, Society President Agnes Beauchamps is most certainly and unarguably dead.<br/><br/>Fearing scandal and in honor of the Society\u2019s history, the hotel\u2019s manager has agreed to allow the remaining members one hour\u2019s time to determine who might be behind the foul deed. After that, the police will arrive, and someone, or someones, will most certainly carted off to jail. <br/><br/>The future of the Society and the fate of its members are at stake. Find the clues, accuse your friends and hope they don\u2019t pin the murder on you. <br/><br/>Long live The Rose!"</br></br></i><br/><br/><a href="http://merb101.livejournal.com/tag/best+friends" rel="nofollow">Here is the scenario description on my LiveJournal.</a><br/><br/>ME<br/><br/><i>edited to add color text from scenario</i> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209154/#Comment_209154" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T16:07:25+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  4:07PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only played Best Friends once, and we played as super-models.

The things the actors did in 'real life' influenced the way the script for the episode they were filming got rewritten, often on the spot. I loved being a literal director in this game, making players 'reshoot' a scene, only with more passion or less technical talk or having to narrate all the visual effects in character after an accident in the FX department ("Oh no, that giant space craft firing thousands of lasers is about to crash into us!")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209379/#Comment_209379" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T09:21:53+00:00" title="May 28, 2009  9:21AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Mullen</cite>I almost can't imagine running Best Friends as something normal</blockquote>I hear ya.

And maybe you wouldn't consider it "changing the rules" to do either of those.  Maybe I wouldn't, either.  I hesitated on that phrasing even as I wrote it.
