The idea is simple: Users receive points for positive contributions to the community, lose points for negative contributions, are permitted to vote whether comments are positive or negative contributions a number of times proportionate to their current number of points, and are not allowed to contribute to the community at all if they lose too many points.<br/><br/>The process works as follows. Please note that every number is configurable through Vanilla's settings page, and the defaults are used in this description for the sake of an easy presentation.<br/><br/>When a user accesses the forum for the first time, he receives 10 points to start with. Each subsequent day the user logs in, he gets 2 points as a bonus for visiting. For each intervening day the user has not logged in, he is penalized 1 point for absence from the forum, up to a maximum penalty of 10 points. This penalty is also limited to the positive points that the user has received for non-moderation actions, specifically to the net sum of the user's sign-up bonus, login bonuses, and absence penalties on record. This prevents a user from having a negative score unless he has actually received negative moderation votes.<br/><br/>Users cannot have more than 25 points, without the appropriate permission assigned to their role.<br/><br/>If a user has a negative points score, he will not be permitted to post or edit comments until his score rises out of the negative range again.<br/><br/>In any 24-hour period, a user is permitted to enter 1 vote per point he has. A user can vote 'up' or 'down' on a comment. Each 'up' vote increases that comment's scores by one point. Each 'down' vote decreases the score by one point. For every 10 positive moderation votes received for comments posted by a given user within the past 30 days, that user gets a 1-point bonus. This bonus is temporary and simply calculated based on moderation activity in the past 30 days.<br/><br/>If a particular comment reaches a net score of 10, then the user who posted it will receive a permanent 1-point bonus. If a comment reaches a net score of -10, then the user who posted it will receive a permanent 1-point penalty. The comment bonus or penalty will be revoked if the comment's score crosses the relevant threshold again.<br/><br/>Each discussion has a score, calculated as the sum of the scores of all comments in that discussion. If a particular discussion reaches a score of 10, then the user who initiated the discussion receives a 2-point bonus. If a discussion reaches a score of -10, then the user who initiated it receives a 2-point penalty. The discussion bonus or penalty will be revoked if the discussion's score crosses the relevant threshold again.<br/><br/>When a comment has a score of 10 or more, or a score of -10 or less, then users will be able to vote that its moderation was 'unfair.' If 10 unfair votes are recorded, then the moderation actions that caused it to reach such a high or such a low score are revoked and each user who moderated the comment in that direction receives a 1-point penalty.<br/><br/>If a comment reaches a score of -15, it will automatically be hidden. If a discussion reaches a score of 10 or higher, then a 'good discussion' marker will be added by way of adding a CSS class to the discussion's HTML representation. If a discussion reaches a score of -20 or lower, it will automatically be closed to further comments being posted.<br/><br/>- <a href="mailto://iamtheari+web@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">The Author</a></em></blockquote>\nI think the time has come for the Story Games forum to finally itself become a story game.  The game is about productive, supportive, inclusive discussion.  The rules of the game should support and encourage those goals, rather than just saying "My buddy Harry's a great moderator: he can make any forum great!"  The above ruleset looks like an excellent start.  Fan-mail-style feedback mechanic, heavier investment leads to greater responsibilities...<br/><br/>I'm pretty much entirely serious there.  My gaming habits have led me to like self-regulation more than self-restraint.<br/><br/>But moving to full seriousness, this is the greatest scheme for adding a point-based system for moderation for small-to-middling forums that I have ever seen. It's apparently already in use by a few folks (who sadly don't provide links to their forums), who are enjoying it, and have only found that it conflicts with some other silly extensions that we don't have.  The author seems to be <a href="http://theari.com" rel="nofollow">responsive, available, and an okay guy. </a>  I think this is a good bet, even though, with my habits, it will not at all favor me at all.<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, arguments against:  It's a big change.  According to the documentation, it adds a panel to the UI, which it has to in order to give people useful feedback of how many points, votes, etc, they have, but that might crowd things more than desired.  Without seeing it in action, I don't precisely know to what degree it's self explanatory.  It might take some thinking and adjusting to set up as, in addition to the various numbers that can be customized, there are more than a dozen different roles with different levels of permissions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171075/#Comment_171075" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T18:56:24+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  6:56PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have talked privately with Andy before bringing it up here; this is his baby and I think it's good to respect that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171104/#Comment_171104" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T21:20:24+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  9:20PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>I would have talked privately with Andy before bringing it up here; this is his baby and I think it's good to respect that.</blockquote>\nNot at all!  It's totally ok in my book to see something and ask about it publicly. Most often a few people might have been wondering the same thing, and it's only a matter of time before someone else asks the same question. And so on. So I don't want anyone to feel that they have to sort of "clear it by me" first before talking about things that might help out the forum.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171106/#Comment_171106" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T21:22:58+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  9:22PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally I think we do fine with the system we have.<br/><br/>(According to the Lumpley Principle, we have a system, right?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171110/#Comment_171110" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T21:45:25+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  9:45PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What problem does it solve?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171114/#Comment_171114" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T21:50:10+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  9:50PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2008 9:51PM by Andy.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, actually, I saw this extension a few weeks ago when I did a regular New Extension Sweep.<br/><br/>My instant first thought was: "Huh, interesting."<br/><br/>Followed by: "...but absolutely, positively, no fucking way."<br/><br/>Not at Story Games, anyway.<br/><br/>I've seen where this kind of mechanism quickly creates toxic environments and relationships quickly. This is a great mechanism if S-G was a huge mechanical beast with dozens of members joining daily, where we needed something to really separate the "real contributors" to the site from the "non-contributors/griefers" beyond simply things like post count, how long they've been on the site, remembering that on that one thread months ago this one dude was helpful and polite, etc.<br/><br/>In an environment that I want to create here, which is totally a "We understand this place is not meant for everyone" place, where the discussions require empathy... voting for Good or Poor contributors in a mechanical way would simply tear the only thing I really care about this site out, and send it spinning towards a horrible end that I simply would walk away from, quickly.<br/><br/>It's also meant to be a "low participation == A-OK!" site... A place where some people can feel free to walk away for days or weeks because they have other stuff on their minds or in their lives, and then pick up again in a few weeks without missing a ton of stuff because of the low overall flow (there are only a few topics per day in general, etc).<br/><br/>But really, this is why I hate it:<br/><br/>Sometimes unpopular (that is, "unliked by more than a few people, usually due to a contrary stance on theory, certain games, etc") people here say things that are worthy of note, when they convey the message respectfully. However, because of some past grievance, or past conflict, the reader reads these otherwise harmless comments as inciting, aggressive, "against the Zen"... when an otherwise calm mind might go, "No, that's not actually happening here". This isn't a hypothetical issue, I've seen it happen here. These people would get quickly ganged up on, and shit on through the mechanism of penalties.<br/><br/>Likewise, if someone popular (that is, "generally liked or respected by more than a few people, usually due to being more vocal, or self-published, or whatever") says something that's hostile or "against the zen", then I really don't have any say in asking that person to calm the fuck down: They have 10 buddies that say "I agree! Bonus!", and their comment, which is anathema to the site, ends in a reward.<br/><br/>Which can quickly lead to games of "Hey all, I think that comment right there was in poor taste. Please all Penalize him." or "I've been in this community for 2 months now, but none of my comments are receiving Bonuses like X, Y, and Z's are. What's the *real reason* behind that behavior?", and stuff like that. This sort of thing ALWAYS adds to a dominant effect sort of behavior: Someone who says something jerky once or twice gets painted with that brush: With the mechanism of bonuses and penalties to follow that user around, folks can get all wired up carefully reading their posts, looking for attacks that aren't there, so that they can hit the button and label them Bad again. This sort of social (not mechanical) behavior happens ALL THE TIME on other various gaming forums which have off-topic areas, I would hate to see this social behavior backed up with a mechanical tool. It would be simply maddening to me as the "admin/social facilitator" of the site to watch that sort of behavior, I'd simply walk away.<br/><br/>Again, this mechanism is GREAT for huge sites where people need to distinguish themselves from others because there's too many people, or because nobody knows each other (which is a condition that happens with some new users here), so without the stupid tricks of "she has more posts than you" or "he's been here longer", peer review is a great mechanism for pushing forward thoughtful speech or good behavior. <br/><br/>But it's not really meant for this environment. Especially in an area where disagreeing with another's views on game theory or some gaming stance or other can directly lead to feelings of being attacked.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171123/#Comment_171123" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T23:21:11+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 11:21PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite>What problem does it solve?</blockquote>\nTsk!

I did post it publicly as a kind of request-for-comments (suitable enough for a forum).  Mission accomplished.  Thank you everyone for your thoughts!<br/><br/>I think it's a frequent problem of mine that I stop thinking critically when I reach the "hey, interesting" phase (thus bypassing the "no fucking way" phase).  I was intrigued by the idea of customizable regulation, but "intrigued" is more an impulse to follow in a laboratory than in a circle of cool and relaxed friends.<br/><br/>If there's no perceived need, then that's the end of the question as to whether it's needed.  If there's no perceived value, then that's the end of the question of as to whether it would be of use.<br/><br/>I'm still interested, but maybe theoretical discussions about online community management are for another forum?  My bizarro-college experience was almost %100 discussion in small groups, which has left me with boudless interest in organizational platforms for 'good' discussion (also, arguments about the nature of 'good' discussion).  Sorry if that leaked.<br/><br/>I will say, that y'all seem to perceive the penalties as much stronger than I did.  The regime doesn't effect anyone's ability to post, just their ability to moderate.  It just seemed to be apportioning moderator responsibilities in proportion to activity.  BUT: that where there are "points," there are people trying to "win,"  I totally agree.<br/><br/>To be more specific: Andy's response was the best.  He gets a point.

And I can say with great certainty that the only trolling I've been seeing <b>has been from you</b> (in threads of your own, or in others' threads). The only assholes popping up in others' threads, or your own threads, <b>again is you</b>.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it's a language/cultural barrier thing, but you're coming off recently like a caustic windbag recently (and even more so in the past few days). Jason mentions this might be because in Poland people tend to speak really straightforward. In general, I've noted that Europeans have a higher tolerance for not taking an argument seriously, and at the same time debating an item until the molecules of the debates have been smashed down to quarks.<br/><br/>So, if your community moderation suggestion went though, I have no doubt that you'd be voted off the island by the community in less than a day.<br/><br/>Admittedly, what goes for "trouble" out here is really quite moderate when it comes to internet message boards in general. I mean, once the loonies like MKAdams were booted to the curb, the next in line of "obnoxious" is no where near that level.<br/><br/>Still, you mentioned it, so I'm responding:<br/><br/>* You've been really shrill these past few days.<br/><br/>* You've been great at stomping on ideas in threads (on this whole "trad sucks, 'story games' is awesome" vibe), although that's more of a "He's stepping on my identity" identity-politics thing than anything. So while it's really annoying, it's not something I'd moderate people over. I'd just ask for more empathy/consideration when spouting ideas.<br/><br/>* In your own thread, you've been looking at ways to find people who disagree with you or have a concurrent point, and push them out of the thread with some kind of OP privilege. It's really embarrassing to watch, actually. While some one might be like "You just started a completely different and interesting conversation, but please take it to another thread", you've been too aggressive about it. The only candidates worthy to speak on your thread is you, I'm afraid. In short, even if someone comes up with a tangential point, so what? It's still referring to the original post, and doesn't deserve this "snap my fingers and banish you form *my* thread" style self-moderation that you've spouting in there. In other words, give people a fucking break: Be glad that they're responding, because a lot of people have already given up on that at this point.<br/><br/>Solutions? <br/>*Don't read too much into people. That's the main thing that gets people agitated, when they read a comment and believe it's an attack. There's a lot of people who do that about stuff that you write (because of your behavior in threads), but recently (like in your own thread) you've been doing the same to others. Just condition yourself to not get caught up into thinking that a statement is an attack on you, or an attempt to derail your thread.<br/>*Be more considerate. <br/>*Don't expect much out of moderating your own threads: Direct people to the points you want to talk about, rather than dismissing them. You've derailed your own threads by trying to moderate them, more than other people have derailed them with their concurrent/salient points on the topic discussed.<br/>*Be less shrill with the "indie/new vs trad/old" thing. It's boring people to death, and unhelpful (unless you tie it in with an example).<br/>*Take a break for a few days or a week if you need to. The threads will still be there. I do this 2-3 times a year, and man it's refreshing.<br/><br/>In the end, I don't like community moderation methods, because they can be exploited be a select few, or people might get caught too far up in identity politics to see when someone has a great idea ("this guy was an ass once in that thread a long time ago, he must be being an ass now"... when he's not). If anything, I only favor going "up" and not "down". But again, if we had a community moderation system where people could "vote people out of a thread" or the like, you'd not only have been kicked out of others' threads, but most likely your own thread as well ("The availability of story gaming" is the one I'm referring to in this post).<br/><br/>So, that's just something to think about. <b><i>Contemplate this... on the Tree of Woe</i></b>.<br/><br/>No offense or nothing, I'm just stating this as objectively as I can.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
