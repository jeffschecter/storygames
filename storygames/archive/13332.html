I'm thinking of trying to run a casual game with/for them this weekend, but have a ton of questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>1) How do you approach getting non-gamers interested and motivated for a 2+ hour session of something like this?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nBackground on my gamers:<br/>\n* They've done a murder mystery dinner once, and they do play Eurogames pretty regularly.  But no roleplaying, and they're not even all nerdy enough to be into steampunk or sci-fi all that heavily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>2) Am I just deluding myself?  Should I just stick to doing this with nerds I find on nerdnyc, instead of torturing my firends?</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>3) What are some of the best games to choose for a group of 4 people who are novices to story games?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSo far looking at:<br/>\n* Lady Blackbird<br/>\n* Fiasco (maybe, haven't read in detail yet, but looks like fun)<br/>\n* Hero's Banner - looks like a great system, but I'd have to gut it and make up my own world - no-one's really into fantasy (ok, that's probably out of the question for a first game)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>4) Any quick links to help for first-time GMs, if you have them handy?</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I think that's the end of my questions <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nBasically - your advice for running story games that are not too hard for novices to understand, to run and to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(If there's already a similar thread that answers my questions, please just link to it - I haven't found though I searched).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iluxan" title="iluxan"><img alt="iluxan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iluxan">iluxan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300350/#Comment_300350" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T21:43:55+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  9:43PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And a totally random bonus question on the side.

Make sure explaining the rules to them takes you as much time as it'd take if you were explaining them a board game. And you'd better have a firm grasp of said rules yourself.<br><br>(I have heard great things about John Harper's <b>Wildlings </b>for initiating non-gamers, but it is sort of fantasy.)<br><br>Don't worry too much about explaining them what a role playing game or a story game is. Something as simple as "this is a game, and with it we'll create some cool fiction". Then proceed to explain the rules.<br><br>Analize their likes. You said they are not too much into fantasy or sci-fi. What are they into then? Chances are there is an indie game (or a hack for one) out there about that very subject. It is easier for them to start within their area of interest and comfort than to jump into a genre they are not too interested in to start with.<br><br>And take it easy. No one would expect you to be a perfect GM on your first time. You are just learning, and your friends should know that.

Once you know who is coming, either chat about the possible games or just have them laying around when they show up. Regardless, let them talk it over, look at the possible games, and choose. It's only a couple of hours! <br><br>Be prepared to essentially demo any of the games you really like - and that has nothing to do with complexity or friendliness to new players. If you like Burning Wheel, and they are all interested in Burning Wheel, give them a couple hours of Burning Wheel. Complexity is a paper tiger. Your friends are smart and awesome and if they are interested they will take to <i>any </i>game like ducks to water.<br><br>Keep it limited to games <i>you really enjoy</i> and are prepared to run for a couple of hours on the spot.

The games you're considering seem like good choices to me. <br/><br/>I've run <b>In A Wicked Age</b> for non-gamer groups before, and most people can get into that. The oracle stage of the game is GREAT for getting people engaged before throwing rules at them. <br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b> is a great game for this, in my experience. It's short, it's super fun, and draws from pretty familiar source material (no elves or wizards).<br/><br/><b>Lady Blackbird</b> is good if you have a larger group, and you're comfortable taking a really strong GM role. Having lots of dice on hand is a smart idea, because the rules make more sense to new players if you can physically have your own pile of dice and pass them over to people, rather than try to keep track on paper.<br/><br/>My main suggestion would be to Bring The Enthusiasm. If you're presenting this as something really fun that you're excited about, even your skeptical friends will probably come along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300435/#Comment_300435" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T11:44:53+00:00" title="November 11, 2010 11:44AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a thread where I got <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12133&amp;" rel="nofollow">lots of useful advice</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300440/#Comment_300440" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T12:16:59+00:00" title="November 11, 2010 12:16PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love Zombie Cinema for this.

Like, an improvised theatre board-game thing." Then they say something polite and curious like, "Oh, that sounds neat!" And then I say, "Yeah, you'd actually be really good at them, [person], because I've noticed [skill], and that's what it's all about."<br/><br/>For example, Geordi's got a great performance voice and he's a creative guy. Jodie is really quick-witted and artistic. Sam's all about creative passion, and really living the moment. Kaleigh's good at working with other's suggestions and building on them. Lindsay's really good at just having fun and jamming with people. Noelle's really good at anticipating and listening and building on good ideas. Stephanie likes to giggle and invent things. Jamie's good at bringing her ideas and even her controversial opinions to the table. Anna does radio, and so she's skilled at being in the moment and making art and doing all that in real time.<br/><br/>So, like: "Yeah, you'd be really good at them, Anna, because it's sort of like radio: you're making art and dialoguing in real time. That's what it's all about."<br/><br/>That's usually a good tactic, to build on their comforts and strengths. Typically, at this point, there are a couple standard responses:<br/><br/>1.) Is it sort of like [D&amp;D / improv / board games / murder mysteries / cosplay / fantasy baseball / kinky roleplaying]?<br/><br/>The immediate answer is always "yes," and then followed by qualifications and conditions and contrasting features.<br/><br/>2.) Hm. Cool.<br/><br/>No further inquiry. They are no longer interested.<br/><br/>3.) So, like, [further questions]?<br/><br/>Immediately proceed to answer their question, pitch them a single game that you think they might be interested in (tweet-length pitch), and then offer a possible time to play (like, Tuesday evening?). Do this like it's as normal as inviting them over to watch the football game.<br/><br/>Clarify that the entire experience takes roughly X hours. Over-estimate by about 1 hour, because there'll be a lot of social time and preamble and people arriving late.<br/><br/><br/>That's been my most successful approach.<br/>I've found it easier to pitch 1 game and 1 time slot, rather than "options."<br/><br/>If I'm pitching to sexy artist chicks, then I pitch Ribbon Drive. If I pitch to clever geeks, then I pitch Shock: Social Science Fiction. If I pitch to someone else, then I pitch Don't Rest Your Head or Fiasco.<br/><br/>Those are the games that get the best receptions with those target audiences.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iluxan" title="iluxan"><img alt="iluxan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iluxan">iluxan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300796/#Comment_300796" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-14T20:51:50+00:00" title="November 14, 2010  8:51PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">@Mcdaldno</a>, thanks for the awesome detailed feedback.

There's a few things you need to explain that you wouldn't even think of--stuff like, "no, you should probably not describe what MY character looks like and does; you can throw out ideas, but I should control my character" (she had just taken "scene framing" to mean "I now get to tell a story about these people") and the whole "nope, your next scene does NOT have to start where the last one left off--" "But I was still in the burning house! And my leg is broken! How did I get out?" "Well if you find this interesting, you CAN play it. But the main conflict was between you and your jealous mother in law, and we were all satisfied with how that ended, so do cut ahead to a totally different scene. How about you look at your other relationship?" <br><br>But once I'd explained those things (and once she'd watched us play a few scenes out between people who had a bit more experience) she quickly caught on.<br><br>Fiasco is definitely brilliant for being so very rules-light. I did run into a few issues, mostly around how to make bad things actually happen in the story, and some problems I had with the tilt, but we all had a great time.

You actively must sell your Frankenstein creation to the other players if you want to win.
