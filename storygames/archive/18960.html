I've got a neat set of Superhero RPG rules. Though I'm English, the rules are based upon American comics because you lot invented the genre and we've never had a strong home grown Superhero industry. All our best talent comes over to the US to work. Though it's fully scaleable, my own game takes as its starting point Marvel comics of the 70's and 80's - the high point of the silver age - and still the source from which most of the current crop of films draws their inspiration.<br/><br/>The game's USPs lie in the rules. I don't intend to list them here unless people ask. However, one key one is the character generation system. There are two extremes in SHRPGs - points buy (Champions, M&amp;M) and random rolling (V&amp;V, Icons) - neither of which are satisfactory IMHO. My game straddles these extremes and uses a mix of random rolling and design which works extremely well. Again, I could write an essay on this but that's not the point on this discussion.<br/><br/>The PERCEIVED USP of my, however, game is that it's "The British Superhero RPG". In fact the current title is SQUADRON UK but, to be honest, there isn't anything particularly British about the rule set. The ethics it promotes are as much "Comics Code" as "Sporting Fair Play". Of course I set the example campaign in a British City (Birmingham) but it can as easily take place in New York or Sacramento.<br/><br/>My question is, if I want to promote my game in the US, how should I go about it? Should I trumpet its UK origins or hide them? Most people in "the business" in this country seem to think that having an overtly British product turns American gamers off. However, one US publisher I spoke to said that, what with Dr Who and Torchwood etc. being so popular, being British is a positive selling point. What's the true picture?<br/><br/>Is the game any good? Does it hold up well against other SHRPGs? Yes.<br/>Is it currently in a professional format? No. It's currently small press, print on demand - but towards better end of such products.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any comments, suggestions or opinions? I'd be grateful to hear your thoughts.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423635/#Comment_423635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T00:33:34+00:00" title="November  2, 2013 12:33AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This depends on the specific audience segment you'd want to sway in the US. For example, being British is probably a positive detail, all factors considered, for the indie crowd; it implies a fresh, more international perspective for the American hipster audience; it's already a hook for that crowd even without you having said anything about your game yet. On the other hand, if you're looking to sway the consumerist segment, it's important to be perceived as "top of the line" (and therefore worthy of paying attention to when you could be looking at the latest FFG or WotC release instead), which is more difficult if you don't have the expected big company brands on your work - and all of those are American. You can compensate on the latter by using other consumerist signalling, such as hardcover full-color rulebooks, certain kinds of graphic design and a marketing strategy oriented towards perceived traditional and prestigious venues, such as game stores. Even then, it's probably best to just not say anything about the origins if you're shooting for the said market - it's an audience that celebrates distance between the creator and the audience, and that means that they don't really want to know about who the creator is or where he's from or what he ate for breakfast.<br/><br/>I don't know enough about the project to comment upon what your target audience segment (and therefore marketing strategy) <i>should</i> be, but from the little you've told I'd say the odds are overwhelming that your best audiences are going to be in the hipster indie and trad small press segments. The former prefers the Britishness (in fact, it prefers anything that actually sets your game apart, being neophilic), while the latter doesn't mind it. Chances are that it won't be necessary for you to particularly obscure your ethnic background.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423639/#Comment_423639" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T06:34:51+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  6:34AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have thought that Golden Heroes still had some cachet, and IIRC the old ads in White Dwarf were very evocative of 80s US comics in a broad archetypal way. I'd be looking to build on that if I was you. I'm English and I collect US comics, I'd be interested in an RPG about US comics regardless of who wrote it. In fact you might even get some traction from the whole Moore/Gaiman/Morrison/Millar tradition of UK writers doing US comics better than US writers can. <br/><br/>BUT, for me a US setting is part of the genre. I wouldn't be interested in a superhero game set in the UK at all. <br/><br/>PS the 70s and 80s are the bronze age and the copper age, the silver age was the 60s :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423640/#Comment_423640" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T06:50:11+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  6:50AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think anybody cares where a game is from if it is really, really good.

I end up screwing around with lots of elements in games anyway before I run them, so I don't think that's such a big deal. <br/><br/>If it genuinely ties in in some ways to British nerd culture (Who, 2000AD, all those genius Brit comic writers), that's awesome. Even if not, I'd still be open to checking it out, as long as it's not intrinsically tied to the British setting in some strange way.  I know guns aren't nearly as common and people worry about knife crime, which probably makes masked vigilantes slightly more plausible.<br/><br/>The problem with your sample setting is that I suspect most USAians don't have any idea whatsoever of what Birmingham's like.  I have a strong visual image of London, a bit of Cardiff, Glasgow, even Manchester -- but Birmingham is a complete blank to me.  Also, there's a major US city of the same name (with a fairly tragic history) which is going to throw people off in a big way.  I just looked up movies set in Birmingham, and I haven't heard of any of those, either, despite being a film buff, so I think this is actually a problem. If there's a very similar American city you could draw parallels to, that would help.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424045/#Comment_424045" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T23:19:51+00:00" title="November 10, 2013 11:19PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'lluch a big deal. <br/><br/>If it genuinely ties in in some ways to British nerd culture (Who, 2000AD, all those genius Brit comic writers), that's awesome. ....<br/><br/>Even if not, I'd still be open to checking it out, as long as it's not intrinsically tied to the British setting in some way.......<br/><br/>The problem with your sample setting is that I suspect most USAians don't have any idea whatsoever of what Birmingham's like.

Very useful.<br/><br/>1) the game isn't tied to British nerd culture being more based on the stan lee/marvel template. But there is a parallel when you say "those genius Brit comic writers...." because distance allows me to come at it from a different angle like they all did....<br/><br/>2) the system isn't tied to Britain. The USP's are in the system not the setting. It simulates to comics code which we never had in this country. (I think we simply used Good Manners instead....)<br/><br/>3) I thought I was bring original using Birmingham as a setting. Possibly I was bring lazy and self indulgent. Maybe I need to think more like a businessman. It DOES grate a bit that THE ORIGINAL Birmingham - which is Britain's second city - is less well known than all those other ones you name, for all the reasons you give. There's just been a British TV series starting Hollywood actors ( Cillian Murphy, Sam Neill) set in Birmingham between the wars about the gang culture of the times which'll probably come over to the US specialist channels which IS worth checking out despite it's title: PEEKY BLINDERS.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
