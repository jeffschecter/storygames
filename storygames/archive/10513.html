I'd decided to bring the wild west boomtown playset, figuring it'd be the most easily related to, and I think it was a good choice.  There was also a names book on hand, which proved very useful.<br/><br/>I played the despicable, handlebar-moustachioed Amos Horton, a fat slice of pure evil who ran the town bank and had his hand in every criminal enterprise.  He'd fathered a child (the sweet baby Charity, an Object: Sentimental) with Eve, the unhappily duplicitous but loving wife of deputy Sheriff Jacob Brownfield. Horton made it plain that if Eve ended their relationship, her husband would suffer.  Poor Jacob was just starting to realize he'd been cuckolded.  Brownfield worked for Simon Coleman, a Sheriff with a mysterious past - there was the matter of a faded wanted poster and his obsession with the bank, which he was planning to rob.  One of his former associates, Victor Sands, had reformed his robbing ways and become a teller in the bank, working for the loathsome Amos Horton, and thus the circle was complete.  The final bit of situation, a pair of blacksmith's tongs intended as a weapon, never showed up and we didn't miss them.  <br/><br/>As a five player game with four non-native speakers, it ran a bit long - four hours all told, if I recall correctly.  The town got its joking name because everybody was telling lies all the time, and each was joyfully bracketed by air quotes.  Amos Horton gave his regards to little Charity's "daddy".  Simon Coleman was a hard-working "Sheriff".  And so on.  <br/><br/>Hopefully Renato or some of the other players can step in for their observations or a blow-by-blow of the game, which ended, as might be expected, with an ugly shootout and an unexpected realignment of power in the town.  It was a very cool session and it made me really happy to see it unfold.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233359/#Comment_233359" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T01:58:34+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  1:58AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2009 3:16AM by renatoram.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, let's try and rake some coherent memories here!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all: the situation building, or more precisely, "Engineering the Fiasco".<br/>\nThe oracle-like process really is a work of magic (or, if you want to be<br/>\nprosaic, an ode to the wonders of our brain's pattern recognition and natural<br/>\n"sense of the story"). You roll some dice, pick elements from the playset you<br/>\nchose (the western boomtown in our case, but I'd like to try the others) and<br/>\nplace them on cards (either the ones close to you, or those close to other<br/>\nplayers), and the situation creates itself very, very naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you were doing some tweaking experiment at our table Jason, because I<br/>\ndon't recall the trick of the indexcard placement (between each couple of<br/>\nplayers around the table) in the playtest document, am I right? Anyway, I find<br/>\nthis kind of setup really brilliant: nobody perceives any card as "his own"<br/>\nuntil you get to define the characters, and I think this lends very well to<br/>\nthe collaborative feeling; everybody around the table is looking at the<br/>\nElements and Details thinking how they can fit together and blend in a way<br/>\nthat makes logical sense. And as I said, it works wonderfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was playing Jacob Brownfield, the deputy sheriff. I envisioned him as a kind<br/>\nof "good guy" from a farming family, turned to the law business because it<br/>\npayed well and was a safe job in such a peaceful little village. Yeah, I guess<br/>\nyou can tell from the start (knowing the kind of stories Fiasco tends to<br/>\nbuild) he was going to be pretty disappointed in his expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacob had a wife, Eve (played by Mauro), and a beautiful baby child, Charity, whose eyebrows<br/>\nreminded much more those of Amos, the bastard Banker, than those of her<br/>\nfather... and in fact Eve (who worked at the bank) had betrayed Jacob with<br/>\nAmos Thorton, the local "big man".<br/>\n<br/>\nJacob also had a boss, Simon Coleman the Sheriff (played by Ariele, the guy at 2:19 <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9lO2qIN1mc" rel="nofollow">here</a>), that was<br/>\ndiscovered in the first scenes to be an ex bandit and bank robber, and a<br/>\n*very* intimidating guy. When the suspect about his past popped up I tried<br/>\n(very candidly) to ask him if it was true, and in a couple of scenes<br/>\ndiscovered that yes, he had a dark past, and that I'd better stay away from it<br/>\nif I valued my safety. Several menacing suggestions about the safety of<br/>\nJacob's family were made, especially by Amos.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings went south pretty quickly while Jacob was pushed around by Amos who<br/>\nwanted the Sheriff gone, and by the Sheriff who wanted him to stay quiet and<br/>\nnot interfere (he was planning his big hit against Amos, an old score to be<br/>\nsettled). Victor, the bank teller (played by Lapo), old robbing buddy of<br/>\nSimon, got tangled in this mess as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon eventually robbed the bank, getting a big bag of money by Amos for going<br/>\naway and be done with it. Jacob chased him together with Victor Sands, but could not (would not) find<br/>\nhim.<br/>\nLater he went, alone, to the camping place where he was sure to find the Sheriff, and<br/>\nconfronted him, asking him to stay away from the town and his family. But<br/>\nJacob was not really <i>hero material</i>; he was just a simple honest man<br/>\ncaught in a situation bigger than him, with people who <i>really</i> did not<br/>\ngive a shit about killing someone else, and Simon knew. Jacob had his gun out,<br/>\nalbeit kept pointing down, and Simon did not even aknowledge it: he simply got on packing<br/>\nhis horse and told Jacob to stand aside and not interfere, 'cause he was going<br/>\nback to town to finish his business with Amos.<br/>\nThis scene was the highlight, I think, in Jacob's story.<br/>\nHe just nodded, taken aback, and Simon shouldered past him, leaving him there,<br/>\nhis gun drawn but never even raised.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final showdown had Simon Coleman with his gun pointed at Amos, unarmed and<br/>\ntaunting him. But Victor was there also, shotgun ready: he shot Simon in the<br/>\nback there and then. The sheriff tried to shoot a last time, wounding Amos but<br/>\ndefinitely not killing him. The deputy came back to town when the action had<br/>\nalready ended. He took the star from Simon's body, appointed himself Sheriff,<br/>\nand after Amos denounced Victor Sands' criminal past arrested the unresisting<br/>\nbank teller.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end Eve had proved Jacob that the adventure with Amos was really over and<br/>\nthat she loved him and they got back together (he got the girl), he was<br/>\ncredited for the arrest of two dangerous wanted criminals (he saved the day) and he became<br/>\nSheriff (he got what he wanted) and the city regarded him as a hero. But he knew he was just a man<br/>\npushed around by much bigger powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Epilogue roll turned out with a kinda good end for him, so we resolved<br/>\nthat Jacob, later on, would try and merit his star, going after Amos (now that<br/>\nhis hold on Eve and Charity was lessened) for his criminal activities and<br/>\ntrying to right his wrongs in the little town.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was very melancholic, sad even in victory.<br/>\nSo, I'd say, a big success!<br/>\n<br/>\n(whew, that was pretty long! thanks to all that endured reading all of it)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233371/#Comment_233371" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T04:52:11+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  4:52AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The moment when Jacob failed to stop the former Sheriff was definitely the highlight of the session for me.
