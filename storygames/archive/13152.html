Moves are kinda like Otherkind Dice applied and sharpened, you know what you're risking, and after you roll you either get all the bad stuff, some of the bad or some of the good or all of the good and none of the bad. Except Moves can do just so much more.</blockquote>\nNow, I've run Ghost/Echo, and I've read the preview version of Apocalypse World (working on the full version now), but I'm not entirely sure I understand Teatine's statement. How is it that Moves can do more than Otherkind Dice? How do the two systems affect play and narrative differently? <br/><br/>Off the top of my head:\n<ul>\n<li>There is an inherent flavour in the specificity of Moves, which can be good, but this makes the system less portable, requiring extra work to come up with new Moves.</li>\n<li>It's possible (although rare) to get a "nothing happens" result with Otherkind Dice that you can't get with Moves, but that requires both the right roll and the player choosing the "nothing happens" way of assigning the dice.</li>\n<li>Moves force you to commit to your action and the possible results before the roll, whereas Otherkind Dice give you options after the roll.</li>\n<li>Moves often don't tell you what the miss result will be, leaving the GM to decide, whereas Otherkind Dice gives you full knowledge beforehand.</li>\n</ul>\nWhat else am I missing?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296304/#Comment_296304" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T15:12:04+00:00" title="October  8, 2010  3:12PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You got all the differences I could think of.  What about repurcussions? <br/><br/>Otherkind dice are less likely to piss of players because they know what they're getting into.  I can play otherkind dice with my 5 year old daughter and she never throws a temper tantrum.  Moves would never fly with my daughter.  I'd tell her, "Ok, roll, but if you miss, I promise you won't like it!" and she'd say, "Let's play something else."  (Sadly, I think a lot of gamers out there are about as mature as my 5 year old daughter.  I've seen thirty-somethings whine about their characters getting killed (and this was 3.5, where getting killed just meant losing a level) like they were still in high school.)<br/><br/>Otherkind dice are good for GMless.  You can all set dangers together.  So I used them in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1CiZv1K8kwZQo7qVNJQzGuElvd6-FdP2dzRW1QSgIGtM&amp;authkey=CKC_9aIB&amp;hl=en#" rel="nofollow">Nowhere Road</a>.<br/><br/>An annoyance with Otherkind dice is the players I know are in a big hurry to roll the dice.  Maybe they're conditioned this way from years of D&amp;D, but a lot of times I'll see a player say something like "I stab him in the face to make him dead" and rolls before we've said, "Wait, what's the danger?"  And then...what do you do?  Say "That roll didn't count" or do you try to figure out the bad stuff post facto?<br/><br/>"Nothing Happens" kind of sucks.  You want *something* to happen when you roll, even if it's bad.  Otherwise it feels like a waste.  So that's a ++ for moves.<br/><br/>And moves are great for flow!  Results and some of the danger already codified and written down in an accessible way.  You don't have to stop and discuss what the 'bad stuff' could be before you roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296313/#Comment_296313" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T19:30:57+00:00" title="October  8, 2010  7:30PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "Nothing Happens" counts as a whiff, and whiffs are not allowed in good games. ^__^ Willing to debate this, if there are good games with whiffs in them. <br/><br/>Personally, I would not/do not allow "Nothing happens."

Sometimes this creates a lot of tension, sometimes it's a bunch of creative work that just doesn't add to the game, like when you come up with a bunch of consequences, then the player rolls really good and none of them happen. With AW moves, you don't have to think of consequences until after the player rolls. So the choice between a variety of outcomes that you have from the very beginning of every roll in OD, you mostly only get after a 7-9 roll in AW, and then the deal or choice is usually from a select list, or an either/or thing (as in acting under fire). Moves are kind of a compressed version of Otherkind Dice, if that makes any sense?<br/><br/>Also with Otherkind Dice, other players can come up with consequences. In AW, it's just the MC that makes moves as a consequence. You could hack that, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296322/#Comment_296322" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T22:33:21+00:00" title="October  8, 2010 10:33PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did notice in my Otherkind hack that, sometimes, some options were thematic "dead weight" at the time, if they didn't come up at all. <br/>Conversely, if we include a rule that says "If the dice say it DOESN'T happen, then it NEVER CAN", that could reintroduce the thematic weight by way of saying "This thing?

As Johnstone said, I see Moves (in their most vanilla application) as compressed Otherkind dice. Ghost/Echo is kinda halfway there because it prescribes when to roll dice and at least one of the dangers that go along with that.<br/><br/>Moves further normalize the results, remove the hassle of coming up with situations before the roll, inject the roll with extra flavour and colour, etc. With moves it's also easier to implement character skill into the picture or modify stuff. As mentioned, Otherkind Dice can also have a bit of the Czege Principle element where the player chooses the conflict for himself and resolves it at the same time.<br/><br/>But I think the point where Moves get considerably better is the much stronger relationship between fictional cues, the roll and fictional consequences. When you're setting up a Otherkind Dice roll, you're sort of creating a move on the spot, for yourself, without all the structural help, and without all the flexibility.<br/><br/><i>"Ok, so you're going into Dremmer's territory? [when you go into Dremmer's territory] Roll [+Sharp]. And the danger is [on a 1-6] he'll see you and shoot you. (at this point we'd roll on OD) if you've got a half-danger [on 7-9] he spots you but doesn't shoot you yet, if you've got a full success [10+] you get where you were going."</i><br/><br/>Or you know, it could have been a roll-and-pick-from-a-list, or just a purely fictional move ("when you go into Dremmer's territory, Dune's people start treating you with suspicion") or a hold move where you can spend your hold to do stuff in Dremmer's land or any other kind (sic) of move.<br/><br/>In OD you've got this one skeleton of a roll you then tackle stuff on. With Moves you've got a structure, that addresses specific instances of the fiction, more specifically instances where there's some sort of a conflict, which allows them to cut deeper into the fiction. It makes the difference between what happens <b>when you walki into Dremmer's Territory</b> and what happens <b>when you listen to the orbital broadcast</b> that much more tangible. At least imo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296350/#Comment_296350" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-09T08:20:43+00:00" title="October  9, 2010  8:20AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am currently deeply fascinated by Dungeon World, which is a copycat of Tony Dowler's hack of Apocalypse World. <br/>And I'm really intrigued by it - - makes me want to play it real bad.
