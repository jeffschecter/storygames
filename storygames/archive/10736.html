I have only been able to do "sparring" tests, and I don't think they stress the system enough.<br/><br/>2) I'd happily let others playtest (and have begged for as much). I am not yet willing to pay people to play test, though I might in time (pay for venue and food, mostly--not actual hired play testers).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
