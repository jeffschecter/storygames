He slams Mai Tai Mai with a super fast fist punch for some physical stress.<br/>Jet picks Johann to go next.<br/>"Not so fast, Agent-Fool!" I yell, and spend a point from the Doom Pool to let <b>Yain</b> interrupt and go next. Yain deploys a pepper spray bomb to do a small amount of physical damage to everyone, "it's basically a food product! hahahaha!" <br/>Interrupt over, so it's <b>Johann's</b> turn and he fires at Makkala, but doesn't succeed, Makkala is too tough.<br/><br/>Now....when I, the GM, decide who goes after Johann, should I be making that decision <i>as if I were Johann's player</i>, i.e. I should pick someone who is best for the heroes, OR, should I be making the decision "as the GM" and picking characters that will make things harder for the heroes?<br/><br/>i.e. if I think Isotropia going next is a good strategy for the heroes because she might be able to take down Mai Tai Mai (or Shutdown her Power Set by yoinking her machine guns out of her hands), then should I pick her, OR should I pick Mai Tai Mai next because my job is to kick the heroes around and make things hard for them?<br/><br/>Help me out here, what's the best idea?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373996/#Comment_373996" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-22T00:59:33+00:00" title="April 22, 2012 12:59AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2012 1:01AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Now....when I, the GM, decide who goes after Johann, should I be making that decision <i>as if I were Johann's player</i>, i.e. I should pick someone who is best for the heroes, OR, should I be making the decision "as the GM" and picking characters that will make things harder for the heroes?</blockquote>\nI'd probably just ask the players (Jet's player or any of them) who goes next. Their ally, their decision.<br/><br/>But I don't really know how you're playing ally NPCs in your game. If you're playing them independently (you're deciding what Johann does, not one of the players), then I'd say that you should absolutely be picking someone who is best for the heroes. You've got your villains to use for making decisions to make things harder for them, you don't need to be using their ally as a sneaky way to throw off their plans. If you make a habit of doing that, they'll just start leaving their allies to guard the horses or the quinjet or whatever rather than bringing them along, and that's lame.<br/><br/>If you're <i>not</i> playing them independently, instead asking the players what Johann does (or even simply accepting it as true when Jet announces something like "Johann is going to roll to assist me!"), then it's doubly weird for you to use Johann's turn as an excuse to jump the line by picking who goes next "as the GM."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HMT" title="HMT"><img alt="HMT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HMT">HMT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374003/#Comment_374003" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-22T04:52:04+00:00" title="April 22, 2012  4:52AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you should consider the initiative choice to be part of the ally's action.

So if someone is like, "Okay, so Jet goes because he's super fast, and then we want Sutherland to go so he can threaten Mai Tai Mai with his .44 Desert Eagle as a support action so that Jammer can fast-talk her into submission...." that solves the question right away: the players have dictated who Sutherland's going to pass to.<br/><br/>If the players haven't dictated this to Sutherland, I would either ask them (if Sutherland is a cooperative, intelligent kind of guy) or make a decision based on Sutherland's personality and knowledge (if he's not much of a team player, recognizing that this could lead to conflict with the players and shouldn't be standard practice).<br/><br/>Another approach here would be to treat Sutherland as a player's Resource from a Covert or Crime skill - he's just an especially mouthy d8 thrown into someone's dice pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374039/#Comment_374039" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-22T16:20:04+00:00" title="April 22, 2012  4:20PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only thing I hesitate on making allied Watcher characters into resources is that this takes up the players "free" resource.

If a Watcher character is aiding a hero, I assume it would be like a Watcher character aiding another Watcher character - just hand over a helping die and get on with it.<br/><br/>But yeah, I think saying they pick someone who is advantageous for the side that they're on (as they see it) is the best way to go.<br/><br/>(I would also note that, OM36 notwithstanding, I think there's going to be plenty of players who decide who goes next after they've started taking turns.
