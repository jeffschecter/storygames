I'm looking for advice on how to make this awesome.<br/>Before I go too far, I also want to say that this question is currently spurred by a pretty specific person and incident.  Also, while I suppose it couldn't hurt for people to recommend specific games that are especially good for introducing non-gamers to the world of rpgs and story games, that's not really what <b>I'M<i></i></b> looking for right now.  I've had many, many games recommended to me that are supposed to be highly newbie friendly (though I'll admit I don't own most of them yet) so you're unlikely to recommend anything I haven't heard.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  but if you want to suggest something, go for it.  even if it doesn't help me it might help others.<br/><br/>So the highly specific situation is this:  I'm friends with a fellow English major and I've always thought it would be cool to game with her.  She's highly intelligent and creative, and I'm pretty sure she'd probably be good at it and enjoy.  The times the topic of rpgs have been brought up in her presence, however, she's generally made some kind of good-natured jab at my nerdiness, so I've always figured she wouldn't be interested and never tried too hard to convince her to play something.<br/>Recently, however, I found myself on a little rant to another friend who, in the past, was a pretty big gamer.  I was talking about how amazed I am at all the different options for games now beyond "Kill monsters and take their stuff."  In particular I was going on about what seems (to me at least) to be something of a surge in games about "serious" topics among the designers that sell on IPR - things like Shock:, carry., Steal Away Jordan, and Grey Ranks.  My other friend came on on the tail end of this conversation, and expressed an interest in Grey Ranks.<br/>I shouldn't have been surprised.  She loves stuff about the Holocaust (like so many people, she was more aware of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising than the city-wide uprising... but I can't criticize... I don't know much about history and before I heard about Grey Ranks, I don't think i was aware of either) and when I talked to her about it later, she said she'd probably be interested in playing.<br/>I also asked her about Perfect, knowing that she likes A Clockwork Orange, and Fahrenheith 451, and 1984, and other things like that, and she said it sounded cool too.<br/><br/>But she said she didn't think she be "good" at role-playing and that she didn't know how the games worked.  I tried to reassure her that it wouldn't be hard, and that everyone playing would be new in one way or another.  But I've never been good at that part of spreading the gaming love.  I'm not a good explainer.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>And that's another reason I'm not looking for recommendations on games to play.  I'm pretty sure this particular friend of mine would need a game with a theme and setting and genre and such that she really can hook into.  I don't think she's the type (at least not YET) to want to play an rpg just because.  So if people think Grey Ranks or Perfect wouldn't be good for a first time gamer... well... that's just too bad.  I'm gonna make them work, dammit!  And if you've got any advice on making those specific games awesome for a first time gamer, please share!<br/><br/>But since I have other non-gamer friends in mind I'm trying to convince to play sometime, I'm really just looking for general advice on how to make things cool and comfortable for them.  I don't really know how great I am at "reading" people, but three of the people I've talked to recently about this, I've kind of gotten the impression that they feel uncomfortable with the idea of it in general.  This probably is at least partially (if not mostly) due to my lack of ability to explain exactly what role-playing is (I tried out the analogy from UA - Improvisational Radio Drama - in an email to one friend today, but i'm not sure if that worked or not), and also I think just because it's something totally new to them.  For people that have introduced non-gamers to something, how have you made things go smoothly?  One thing I've wondered is if it would be a good idea to do a game where every player (except me... the GM or facilitator, or whatever) is a non-gamer so that people don't feel as though they are the only ones who are new.  Or would the potential confusion kind of feed on itself and grow out of control?<br/><br/>As with most things in my life, I'm probably thinking about this WAY too hard, but I'm hoping that's better than not thinking about it at all.  If I manage to get any of my non-gamer friends to play something with me, I really want to try to make sure that their first experience with an rpg or story game is as awesome and enjoyable as possible!  Help me make this dream come true!<br/><br/>and once again, sorry about such a long post.  whew.  i can go on when i let myself. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94922/#Comment_94922" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T20:23:03+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  8:23PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's how I always pitch gaming of any kind:<br/><br/>"It's a game where instead of trying to win on a board, we make up stories.

She did great and had a good time (Hans?  John?  Terry?  Care to elaborate?)<br/><br/>Here's the thing - roleplaying and storytelling are very natural activities.  I think that a game like the ones you mention hew closer to what people are comfortable with anyway, although that might just be my bias.  There's not a ton of cruft between player and character.  You have lots of freedom to describe things and participate all the time.  It's not arcane or fetishy or demanding, for the most part (although compared to Scrabble it sure as hell is).  I've played The Roach with complete noobs without a hitch on several occasions, and I think that game is harder to play than Grey Ranks, personally. <br/><br/>So two things:  <br/><br/>1.  Jason's got the right of it, as far as I'm concerned.  She's interested, go play.  Don't make any concessions, don't treat her like a delicate flower, just explain the rules as you go, set a good strong example, and play the game.  Don't worry about the player mix too much.  You <i>are </i>thinking about it way too hard!  <br/><br/>2.   People without "gamer damage" (however you define it, and I do not exclude myself from that category) are often <i>brilliant </i>gamers.  You are in for a treat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizthefair" title="lizthefair"><img alt="lizthefair" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizthefair">lizthefair</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94984/#Comment_94984" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T06:31:00+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  6:31AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a relatively new gamer I thought I'd chime in here.<br/><br/>The best thing you can do is be aware of all the conventions/rules/whatever that are specific to role playing and be able to explain them in layman's terms--or at least in a way that links to other things she already understands.<br/><br/>Also, don't say "oh that's easy" as part of an explanation.  It's easy for you, and down the road it may be easy for her.  But if she has trouble grasping a concept that you've identified as "easy" she is less likely to ask for help.

If they're not complete noobs, they should outnumber them.  But if you know the veteran players and they'll stick to Morningstar's Not A Dick rule, then it should be okay.  Definitely do not bring your friend who can't help but explain everything, though.<br/><br/>How to do it?  Just sit them down and go through the game step by step.  Don't make them read the book or try to tell them all - at most have them look at only a specific section, generally picking something from a list, like the Grey Rank chapter lists (or for another game example, if they need ideas for Aspects in Spirit of the Century).  But I've introduced people through a variety of games, and every time the method that works best is explain as you go.  Don't explain anything more than the most basic premise.  And go through the character sheet to explain what things are, and then answer questions that come up.  Then go to the next step. And the next step. And in play, first time using a new rule, explain what it is and make sure people understand.<br/><br/>But unless they ask to read the book, don't ask them to read it. Most likely they won't anyway, and at worst, they'll get overwhelmed and talk themselves out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95197/#Comment_95197" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T13:02:30+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  1:02PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 1:03PM by Remi.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is mostly for once you get them in the room.<br/><br/>Be prepared! Bring pencils, dice, and whatever else you need. Know the rules and procedures, but don't be afraid to say, "I don't know," and look something up. Avoid getting drawn into extended conversations about mechanics or metagaming. If the game works, the effect and use of the rules should be self-evident.  Have a settling-in dinner beforehand and make sure the room you're playing in is comfortable, well-lit, and has enough seating. <br/><br/>Be ready to have an amazing time. Be ready to facilitate and lend an unobtrusive hand, be ready to answer questions quickly and positively. Be vocal with your support when someone does something awesome, or surprising, or clever, or all three at once. Mostly let the game find its boundaries of comfort organically, but do not be afraid to occasionally push the thematic envelope.<br/><br/>Watch out for patterns. If you have three scenes that are-more-or-less the same, try to demonstrate different ways to approach scene framing.

It's crunchy. Making characters before playing can be a confusing step for first time gamers, because they don't know what they're creating for. It's like having to assemble a bike before ever riding one.<br/><br/>I have three suggestions for getting through this speed bump:<br/>1.) Pre-generated characters. I am really leery about this though, because having a solid connection to your character is ultra ultra important in this game.<br/>2.) Do the aspect Gains/Fallouts bit for them, and just get them to fill in the aspect titles.<br/>3.) Give an overview of the system as you go. So explain the society as you pick your Status and Archetypes, give an overview of scene framing as you do Certifications and Intolerances, and give an overview of crime tests before you do Aspects.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is the most delicate one, but the most successful one if you get it.<br/>Don't overload them by saying "okay, first I'm going to tell you all the fiddly bits, then you're going to make a character, then we'll play." It'll feel like a huge information dump with a rigorous exam at the end of it.<br/>Just tell them as much as they need to know to do chargen well, as you go through it. Explain the system and use Aspect creation as a way of reinforcing that knowledge, by giving them a chance to toy with how to win against that system.<br/><br/>Next, be clear on the GM role: you are a Facilitator (asking questions, provoking thought) while they do their crime vignette, and you are a Prosecutor (trying to win against them) and a Collaborator (doing back and forth narration) during the Crime Tests.<br/><br/>If you have any questions about Perfect, email me at joepub88 at hotmail dot com.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95223/#Comment_95223" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T14:07:22+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  2:07PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 2:09PM by jackson_tegu.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [edit: wrote concurrently with joe, here]<br/><br/>i'm of a slightly different school of thought - <br/>instead of going through the books carefully in order to play a game as written with new players,<br/>i would rather free-form a lot of things, sort of quickly discuss a setting derived from the game we <br/>want to play and start playing pretty fast.<br/>this is because Playing A Role-Playing/Story Game and Preparing To Play Such A Game<br/>are wildly different activities, and i've recently freaked a friend of mine out (with Perfect, actually)<br/>trying to build a character before play. making the character took a really long time<br/>(probably longer than it needed to take, as that i wasn't as familiar with Perfect as i could've been<br/>before we started) and he ended up feeling really unsure about the relative importance of different things and so on.<br/><br/>i think it's more important to start having conversations in-character and getting a feel for what role-playing is,<br/>then the specifics which make the game you are playing different from all the games you currently aren't.<br/><br/>as that i'm starting a bunch of friends (n00bs) on a story game today; is there a feeling that this approach is damaging? <br/><br/>for my part, i agree that noobs are just as likely to be totally awesome as other players you've not played with before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95226/#Comment_95226" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T14:15:13+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  2:15PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>i've recently freaked a friend of mine out (with Perfect, actually)<br/>trying to build a character before play. making the character took a really long time<br/>(probably longer than it needed to take, as that i wasn't as familiar with Perfect as i could've been<br/>before we started) and he ended up feeling really unsure about the relative importance of different things and so on.</blockquote>\nI've had this thought as well.  I've actually been sort of considering trying Psi Run out first with the non-gamers I'm thinking of, if they're all interested in the setting/theme/genre.  It seems like it could easily be done as a one shot, character creation is really fast, and the rules are very simple and light.  But otherwise, they're smart people used to reading and dissecting pretty heavy junk.  I think they could handle whatever, and when push comes to shove, we'd have to play whatever they think they can really hook into and enjoy.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Just tell them as much as they need to know to do chargen well, as you go through it.

I usually try to do this whenever possible both with roleplaying games and board games.  Playing Arkham Horror with someone who didn't know that game last week really drove home how important and also difficult this can be with certain games.  I'm not always completely successful at "explaining as we go" but I usually try to go that route.  Of course, one reason for that is because most of the games I've had in the past have had too many different fiddly bits to reasonably explain ALL of them from the start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95423/#Comment_95423" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T09:20:56+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  9:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>[edit: wrote concurrently with joe, here]<br/><br/>i'm of a slightly different school of thought -<br/>instead of going through the books carefully in order to play a game as written with new players,<br/>i would rather free-form a lot of things, sort of quickly discuss a setting derived from the game we<br/>want to play and start playing pretty fast.<br/>this is because Playing A Role-Playing/Story Game and Preparing To Play Such A Game<br/>are wildly different activities, and i've recently freaked a friend of mine out (with Perfect, actually)<br/>trying to build a character before play. making the character took a really long time<br/>(probably longer than it needed to take, as that i wasn't as familiar with Perfect as i could've been<br/>before we started) and he ended up feeling really unsure about the relative importance of different things and so on.<br/><br/>i think it's more important to start having conversations in-character and getting a feel for what role-playing is,<br/>then the specifics which make the game you are playing different from all the games you currently aren't.<br/><br/>as that i'm starting a bunch of friends (n00bs) on a story game today; is there a feeling that this approach is damaging?<br/><br/>for my part, i agree that noobs are just as likely to be totally awesome as other players you've not played with before.</blockquote>\nI feel that approach is extremely likely to be damaging, actually.  If the n00bs aren't familiar with the rules, and the GM is, then that simply exacerbates the difference in power that already exists.  It's an unhealthy dynamic.  "Free-forming" means "the GM says what happens," in my experience, and that's not likely to produce results that your new players like or that make them feel empowered.<br/><br/>Introducing new players with games that are relatively rules-light, however, is an excellent idea.  I've had success with PTA and 1,001 Nights, which were both recommended to me for that purpose.

You definitely got to know your audience.<br/><br/>Anecdote:  I recently introduced a friend to gaming who had never gamed before, though she is a big geek and is pretty much a part of the culture already, by running a Burning Wheel one-shot with her and some other friends.  Thing is, she's a fellow mathematician (actually physicist, and physicists tend to be better at math than mathematicians), so I felt confident that the mechanical part of the system wouldn't be a problem for her, and the support that BW provides in terms of character motivation is so strong, that it seemed a good choice.  It worked out very well, in fact.  She said her main worry had been not knowing what to do, not mechanically, but as in, "what the hell do I do in this scene?", and the Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits really helped with that.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I think many first-time gamers have the opposite problem.  They intuitively grasp things like character motivation, but have trouble grokking <i>how</i> the game allows them to play out those motivations, through combat or magic or seduction or whatever.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95821/#Comment_95821" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T05:01:39+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  5:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Interestingly, I think many first-time gamers have the opposite problem.

My experience with The Roach, and new gamers, confirms this.  I've seen a number of people new to gaming absolutely grasp their character, and the setting, and their motivations, and the interplay of all of them, but get stymied by die handling.  This is, of course, an argument for jeepform (grin).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96709/#Comment_96709" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T20:16:15+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  8:16PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say don't worry about following the rules too much. I was a newbie once. All of us hardly worried about following the rules. We'd play Undermountain with 1st level characters and it would work. I'm finding with introducing my gf to gaming (at her request) that I have to be more flexible than I've gotten used to being with gaming over the years.<br/><br/>I also introduced a friend of mine to Sweet Dreams, he really got it, had a lot of fun, but was made really uncomfortable by the relationship aspect, particularly the fact that his male character had a crush on my female character. I imagine it was a bit of confusing character and player romance and also having some homosexual overtones because of that, plus maybe just not being comfortable with roleplaying romance. I think had the game lacked that one aspect, that makes it really cool to a lot of people, he might have been into keeping playing it. So the advice I could give there, is if the game has a rule on something, and the player seems to be ignoring it, mention it once but don't push it. If that aspect just doesn't sit with the newbie, quietly move on to a different game that lacks it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97442/#Comment_97442" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T02:27:24+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  2:27AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This comes to mind:<br/><br/><a href="http://shootingdice.blogspot.com/2006/07/zero-to-gamer-in-15-minutes.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://shootingdice.blogspot.com/2006/07/zero-to-gamer-in-15-minutes.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
