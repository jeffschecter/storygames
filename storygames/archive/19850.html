To do that I need to be sure I am communicating clearly and quickly. However, I am now to the professional side of things and I want to avoid newbie mistakes.<br/><br/>Here is what I have so far:\n<blockquote><i>Epiphany</i> is an RPG inspired by movies like <i>Groundhogs Day</i>, <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i>, and <i>Freaky Friday</i>. Focusing on the journey of a single protagonist, <i>Epiphany</i> has only one "player." Everyone else takes on the role of a "Fate" building a cinematic world and vying for control over the protagonist's destiny.</blockquote>\nFor folks who seem interested but don't want me talking their ears off I have this which will probably appear on a one sheet description of the system:\n<blockquote>The mechanics focus on competing for narrative agency, the emotional development of the protagonist, and building on story events. <br/>-<i>Epiphany</i> uses dice pools that shift between the Fates and the Protagonist to represent the shifting balance in the story. Players wager resources knowing that the next action they could fall into the hands of other players.<br/>-The Protagonist's "stats" represent the her worldview and emotional state. So characters change develop as part of gameplay.<br/>-Key events in the story are linked together to provide every play-through with a clear narrative and strong sense of theme.</blockquote>\nShould it be shorter? Should it be longer? Is it clear or am I using buzz words?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>TL;DR I'll be pitching a game for the first time and I need pointers from folks with experience of a solid pitch.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439921/#Comment_439921" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T21:38:42+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  9:38PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2014 9:39PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aside from a few typos, that's a really solid pitch.

It's also unusually informative, for a quick pitch, which really appeals to me. <br/><br/>(I'm not a fan of all those, "Discover roleplaying like you've never seen it before! Maximum immersion!

You want to tell someone why the game will give them a compelling story first and foremost.  Then, once you have their interest, you can tell them what the mechanics look like.  But that's for after the elevator pitch.<br/><br/>If I strip away mechanical talk from your pitch, I'm not left with much at all.  It's a game about a single protagonist... who changes over the course of play.  And some movies are cited, that seem to be linked through weird, impossible things happening to the protagonist.  But I'm unclear on what that is about, exactly.  There's not a lot to go on there.  Tell us more about the sort of stories that the game tells.  Tell us who the story is about, what they do and why we should care about them.<br/><br/>One good technique is to end your blurb with a few questions that will be answered in play.  "Will you negotiate the peace treaty before the interstellar warships destroy the earth?" "Will you find the traitor before they sabotage the mision?" etc.  This creates uncertainty and engagement in the audience.  They want to know the answer to the question, and they have to play to find out.  (This is a trick stolen from comic books, which will often have a dangling question in the last panel of a page, to make you eager to read on.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439956/#Comment_439956" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T15:38:28+00:00" title="November  5, 2014  3:38PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually complain a lot over people's pitches - that they should tell the WHY, etc. - but I liked your pitch. <br/><br/>I would probably short down the mechanics bits.

Is that true?  I wasn't sure about that.  If so, then yeah, present it like that.<br/><br/>I'd also like to know if the competition for narrative agency is a matter of:<br/>- Fate vs Fate (your first blurb made me think this)<br/>- Protag vs Team of Fates (your part about "dice pools that shift between the Fates and the Protagonist" made me think this)<br/>- everyone at the table vs everyone else (combining the above made me think this)<br/><br/>I'd also like to know the object of this competition.  Is it to get the protagonist to a given player's desired outcome?  Or is it just for each player to be able to grab the reins when they'd like to (presumably when inspiration strikes)?<br/><br/>If the Protag player isn't competing, what are they doing?<br/><br/>The answers to these questions won't <i>be</i> the pitch, but I think they should help refine and focus it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ONE_SHOT" title="ONE_SHOT"><img alt="ONE_SHOT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ONE_SHOT">ONE_SHOT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439979/#Comment_439979" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-06T02:05:32+00:00" title="November  6, 2014  2:05AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> Great note, I'll adjust this to define the nature competition in the game. <br/><br/>Technically the Protagonist is trying to protect their free will from the Fates, however each fate as a different vision for the portraitist's destiny.

Well, in Epiphany you get to play those Gods. <br/><br/>We call them 'Fates', and we use dice pools to take turns controlling the narrative, with the protagonist 'stats' representing his or her worldview and emotional state. The story is not random though; there are clear milestones along the way, and a unifying theme. Give it a shot!"<br/><br/>Or maybe without the "give it a shot" at the end, lol.

Simply dressing a product as "non-gamer friendly" won't matter if the activity is 4 hours of makin' stuff up.  <br/><br/>Does Epiphany transcend traditional barriers?
