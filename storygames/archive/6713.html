Hey, I deserve it!<br/><br/>In amongst visiting my family and friends in Catalunya, exploring the Pyranees, Massif Centrale and disappearing into nature for a while, I'm keen to play some games that will work with the trip. However, there are some criteria that must be accommodated. To whit:<br/><br/><b>Low number of Players</b> There'll just be the two of us for the most part. Three for the first stretch of the trip, including a bunch of time on a ferry, which we could definitely play a few sessions of something fun.<br/><br/><b>Tone</b> I'm not after playing something twisted and disorienting, a La Lacuna /DRYH, but neither something light and adventure-like. My desired sweet spot would be something explorative, thought provoking, and affecting. This doesn't preclude tough or difficult content, necessarily. A point of light would be Sign in Stranger, from what I understand of it, but I gather it isn't released.<br/><br/><b>Mode of Play</b> We'll be driving a lot, walking a lot, and sitting crosslegged outside tents under starlight much of the remainder. A game that employs few or non-cumbersome mechanics (to this end, I guess Drama/Karma are favourable), and is light on book-keeping, or amenable to delegating this to passengers when driving, would really go a long way to being a part of the trip, rather than a fun intrusion. <br/><br/>I doubt anything entirely fits this bill, but I'm curious if there are some contenders, particularly in terms of the Mode of Play. If not, there should be! <i>Road trip, supported by the Story Games Community</i><br/><br/><br/>Finally, my trip is semi-determined at this stage (Santander-&gt;Barcelona via Aragon, Pyranees, possibly Belize, Centrale Massif, north to Paris) but not set in stone, neither. If any local gamers would be interested in crossing paths, whisper me. It could be really nice!<br/><br/>Thanks people.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148828/#Comment_148828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T08:52:04+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  8:52AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2008 8:53AM by Graham.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Polaris would be great, when you have three of you.

Folkloric horror  (DWiWW) fits my desired buzz a bit more than slasher type stuff - or am I misconstruing Dead of Night?<br/><br/>Bleakworlds - I think we will almost certainly bring this along, actually. Except all the tables could get fiddly, maybe. Bah, with my improv fu I don't need your puny tables in any case!<br/><br/>Polaris with three? Anyone care to give the details?<br/><br/><br/>It has to be said, these are enticing options, but I still feel like I'm not honing in on exactly what I'm looking for. <br/><br/>Back to the tone. I'm going to be cleaning my head out between jobs, my buddy is trying to sure up his Grand Plan for the future, and one ambition is to use the time chatting shit and solving problems, whether they be the west's, the world's, or our mums. Or our own. So exploring space and being spooked will be enjoyable as of themselves, but aren't necessarily facilitating the headspace I'm hoping to develop there. They could do! But that's not what they're built toward.<br/><br/>Take Death's Door as an example of maybe what I'm looking for. I've no idea how it does with the other criteria, but thematically it's doing the kinds of thing I'm after. Does anyone know the game enough to comment? Any thoughts on other games with this kind of approach? Solipsist does seem a good fit - how would it handle under the conditions mentioned?<br/><br/>Any thoughts gladly received!

Normally requires some dice-rolling and scratch-paper marking after each conflict.

I grew up playing car games of all sorts with my family, and my husband and I play a wide variety of car games when we go on long trips. They're mostly word games and guessing games, though. The closest thing we have to a story game is one where we take turns telling a few lines of a story, and the next person takes over the narrative when you pause. It's hardly a "game", though. It would be a lot of fun to have something with some sort of conflict mechanics, even as simple as "I'm thinking of a number from one to ten" and how close the guesser is determines the result. It would have to have, for me anyhow, pretty much zero record-keeping and zero dice-rolling, if it's going to be played in a car (especially when driving at night).<br/>I'll definitely keep my thinking cap on during the drive the JiffyCon later this month...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149405/#Comment_149405" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T15:01:17+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  3:01PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some really great ideas here, thanks!<br/><br/>Jule Ann and Jono: definitely.

Carl - you mentioned Nighttime Animals and I think this is a good example of design working in this area. I should definitely have a look over that before going.<br/><br/>Shock: is a definite possibility - I got it for Christmas, and it is orange, so hard to argue with, really.

Trollbabe would be good but I understand the content is being rejigged and I'd rather wait for the tightened up version. 1001 Nights (or Binary Nights, as I chucklingly call it) would be another option, definitely.<br/><br/>Rolling dice into a hat... hmm.

Any thoughts on other games with this kind of approach?</blockquote>\nHi, I think I'm familiar with that one. ;p<br/><br/>Death's Door would not, I think, survive well with active travelling; it tends to pull at your attention.  But in terms of sitting and playing under starlight, or on a long ferry, it would manage very well.<br/><br/>I would add my voice to chip in with 1001 Nights as a good fit.  The mechanics are simple enough that you could easily set one person in charge of the dice.<br/><br/>Also Amber Diceless is a fantastic travelling game.<br/><br/>thanks,<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154734/#Comment_154734" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T15:28:12+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  3:28PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I'm back.<br/><br/>I hope no-one's going to kill me when I say:<br/><br/>we played no role playing games.<br/><br/>.<br/>..<br/>sorry.<br/><br/><br/>Seriously, though, when you match it up against this: <br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3088/2632484504_d8eedba04e.jpg?v=0"/><br/>and the hairpin bends it takes to get there, it makes much more sense to be attending to the environment.<br/><br/>Lots of fantastic suggestions though - I did pack Shock: and some Polaris excerpts for the road on their basis!
