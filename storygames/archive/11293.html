Former Nazis.  Terrorists.  People whose background and/or attitudes place them outside the realm of the norm morally before they take a single action.  But I was thinking about something <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/account.php?u=1661" rel="nofollow">Z-Dog</a> posted to my discussion, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11165" rel="nofollow">Wars We've Fought</a>:\n<blockquote>We did RECON Cold War 3rd World Merc game: build your base and defeat the Red across the border, deal with drug running, etc.<br/><br/>It was scary.<br/><br/>There's something about being in a position of absolute power, or where the power is coming out of the barrel of the gun, and you have no laws, and only a mission: deal with this threat by any means necessary.<br/><br/>First mission: they execute a lazy local soldier they just recruited for stealing an M-16.<br/><br/>There is some scarrrrry racial/national/nation-building/corruption stuff lurking below the surface of white middle class America.</blockquote>\nIt <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=248150" rel="nofollow">that comment</a> is the seed of a new discussion \u2014 this one, hopefully \u2014 about what it takes to get players to tip over into the zone where they're committing heinous acts.<br/><br/>There's a certain school of thought that says even the most basic of roleplaying scenarios, the dungeon crawl, is nothing more than near-genocidal murder spree punctuated by paroxysms of looting.  I'm looking at something a bit more involved than that.  I'm talking about participating in rape in a <i>Carry</i> game or executing peasants in the Mexican Revolution or torturing a Communist guerrilla for information.  These are things that are <i>clearly</i> against the moral grain of the average person, but can and have been done in games before.<br/><br/>I know I've done it.  When playing games of <i>Merc</i> and <i>Recon</i> in the '80s I routinely tortured the bad guys for information and/or shot them when I was through with them.  That kind of casual atrocity was mirrored in the incredibly violent, <a href="http://readgoldeagle.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Gold Eagle Books</a>-inspired Cold War games of <i>Top Secret</i> I played.  If someone was a Communist it gave I and my fellow players free license to do the most awful things to them and sometimes laugh about it.  I mean, they were <i>Commies</i>.<br/><br/>Absent that sort of Cold War cold-bloodedness, I'm not sure what would flip that switch for players today.  Obviously there some fruitful roleplaying ground when playing out, say, the <i>Carry</i> scenario involving sexual assault.  That game is pretty much <i>about</i> the moral and ethical unraveling of the characters in war, though such a happening wouldn't be so much commonplace as nearly inevitable. But where and how does that sort of thing enter into a broader set of play?  And <i>should</i> it, as far as that goes?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie" title="RoninZombie"><img alt="RoninZombie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie">RoninZombie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250790/#Comment_250790" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T09:28:09+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  9:28AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing the <i>other</i> can bring out atrocities in play.

My game <i>The Rustbelt</i>, a sort of postapocalyptic thing, has PC-perpetrated atrocity fairly often.<br/><br/>1. There's a metaphysical force called the Rust that represents corruption, dissolution, and decay in all its forms. Its voiceless ultimatum to everyone (including the PCs): "Be corrupted or be killed." It's treated like a character, and it can talk people into giving in to corruption and committing atrocity.<br/>2. The GM is specifically instructed to set things up that, when a PC really wants something, the means to get it are either wrong or too hard. (I should note that "too hard" is something that PCs can always overcome -- for that matter, so is "impossible" -- so it's not railroading)<br/>3. If not outright encouraged, it's totally acceptable for your PC to be evil from the get-go, <i>and even remain that way</i>, as well as starting good or detached or merely ugly and sliding into actively bad. The subtitle of the game is "Tales of Tenacity, Depravity, and Hope," and for some people, the depravity is the part they want to explore (sometimes I do too). Plus there's some other mechanics that keep make sure that even evil, monstrous characters are still human, with compelling and believable emotions and psychology.<br/><br/>Don't yell at me, but it's not out yet, although it will be sometime this year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250809/#Comment_250809" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T10:24:52+00:00" title="January 14, 2010 10:24AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting people to commit autrocities is fairly easy to do - in real life and in games.<br/><br/>1. Give people absolute power with no accountability. You get no accountability when a superior tells them to do it. Just following orders.<br/>2. Dehumanize the "enemy" - in D+D it's done by calling them "monsters" rather than "innocent women and children"<br/>3. Insulate the people giving the orders by having two or three tiers of commands coming down the chain of command so they are just following orders.<br/>4. Insulate the top people by asking them to make a list of "proposals" on how to handle a situation. See, they aren't giving an order just a recomendation.<br/><br/>The trouble with this is that it emotionally hurts everyone involved with it. It's bad.<br/><br/>You can do this by recruiting child soldiers (where you immediately make them kill a family member in front of witnesses so they can't go home), run aways (where else do prostitutes come from) and the emotionally damaged (for whatever reason). Run through a dehumanizing basic training and bingo! You have badness.<br/><br/>Google Milgram and Zimbardo.<br/><br/>It seems to me that Dogs in the Vinyard games could go this way real easily. I've not played so I don't have any evidence for this but the set up is teenagers with absolute authority with guns. Put another way this means child soldiers, with guns, with no oversight, enforcing rules that they can't understand. I'm certain that groups turn on one another frequently over how far to go as well as getting into trouble with the territorial authority.<br/><br/>I must admit killing hordes of monsters is fun in a cartoon like way. I don't want too much realism because that puts me too close to seeing what I don't want to see. <br/><br/>So - can you get people to do this - sure, it's an easy manipulation. I'm wondering how far I'd want to go down this road. I'd need a very good premise to make me want to explore this very far. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250811/#Comment_250811" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T10:30:26+00:00" title="January 14, 2010 10:30AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've heard about The Rustbelt before, but now it sounds AWESOME.<br/><br/>Anyway, I mentioned to Sam over in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a> that I find myself slipping into the "Atrocity Zone" pretty much effortlessly, and then I related a story that he suggested would make a good example.<br/><br/>The story begins in an Apocalypse World game when my Hocus drug dealer got high and attempted to reach into the Psychic Maelstrom and failed. Long story short, the character was faced with just how shitty a person he really was and wound up sobbing with his crew laughing at him. I attempted to assault the one leading the jeers to intimidate the crowd into shutting up, and failed again.<br/><br/>Long story short, my character was lead around the room by the nose by his second in command while he made airplane noises. <br/><br/>I decided that my second in command had to die.<br/><br/>Next session I managed to round up a mob of my own men and some of the local big cheese's thugs who were armed with assault rifles. So they throw this guy in front of me, and I tell him he's going to die and he starts blubbering and appologising. He even tried to bribe me with candy.<br/><br/>That's about when I realized how psychotic my behavior really was. I had this guy humiliated and then gunned down in cold blood (yeah, I went through with it despite my second thoughts), just because he had embarrassed me (well, my character, but there was certainly some emotional investment on my part too).<br/><br/>So this thread has got me thinking back on how I've had characters act in the past and I'm actually slightly creeped out by what I see. I've nailed a hobgoblin spy to the floor and then tortured him while my friends (in and out of game) watched horrified, I've burned down a church full of sleeping nuns because my character had a beef with their religion (OK, they were EVIL nuns, but it still caused a reaction at the table), I had a cop character torture a vampire and gloat that he couldn't do anything about it since the dead lack legal rights, I've knowingly trained and equipped terrorists because they were in a position to destabilize my enemies . . . and that's just the worst of it. I've probably killed millions of innocent security guards without a second thought just because they were in my way, just like I'm sure countless other gamers have.<br/><br/>Now, the really weird part is that outside of games, I don't think I'm an aggressive or vindictive person, but for some reason when I'm rolling dice I'll unthinkingly (fictionally) do unspeakable things for revenge or simple expediency.<br/><br/>It sort of leaves me wondering what part of my personality it is that makes me want to play characters who are at best of questionable morality and at worst completely psychotic and what makes it so easy to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250895/#Comment_250895" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T15:18:20+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  3:18PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I had a cop character torture a vampire and gloat that he couldn't do anything about it since the dead lack legal rights</blockquote>\nOh.

In the end, it still takes out impulses in a way which doesn't harm any living being, isn't it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the most common roleplaying context, it's some cheerful orc-bashing and dungeon crawling, but a different atmosphere and expectations can open up the way for more intense expressions, i guess (the Milgram experiment, quoted by MatrixGamer, is right about setting and context-induced violence): when i was 15 and playing basic D&amp;D, or in such 'vanilla' games, torturing the goblin you  manage to get captive may feel distasteful, for me in the first place, but if everybody is older and more comfortable with violence, and maybe the game setting opens this possibility up in some way  (i've been playing a lot of  low-magic, gritty fantasy settings lately), it may just come. Introducing narrative games in the mix, shifting the focus from just beating the goblin and reaching the teasure to narration and emotional involvement may still raise the stake further, i imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250930/#Comment_250930" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T18:01:53+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  6:01PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam H: I wrote a game around this idea and I don't think it takes anything for anyone to "tip over."

[emphasis added]<br/><br/>I've been reading your various threads on along these lines for some time now, intrigued, but also staying away for reasons I couldn't quite put my finger until now.<br/><br/>Now, I write what I'm about to write knowing that there are many reasons people play, that different groups want different things, that different games are designed to do different things, and so on.<br/><br/>I'm curious why you want to get your players to do anything <i>in particular</i> on a moral scale.<br/><br/>That is, I love running games as a GM that allows the Players to make all sorts of decisions on a moral scale. This is the essence of the stories I love, from <i>The Iliad</i> to <i>The Shield</i>, and I really love to make stories with this kind of engine within them. Macbeth, the characters in the fiction of Nathaniel Hawthorne and so on all are capable of, and sometimes do, slip into the atrocity zone.<br/><br/>But -- in my view, or at least in how I like to play -- I expect that though the moral dimensions are laid out on the table for the Players to rummage around within during play, it is their choice when and how their characters will make one moral decision or another. This is, for me, part of the job as a GM -- to create the space for plausible, compelling and narratively rich moments of crisis or decision for the Players to decide how their characters will respond. Some might respond with noble behavior, other with atrocity, and all sorts of variations and change in options through play.<br/><br/>To assume that the Players <i>will</i> move to atrocity, or to try to move them toward it, in my experience usually leads to frustration. It's not just a matter that one or more Players might not want his character to be atrocious (though that is the most important point. It's also that I have found, unless the expectations are spelled out with absolute clarity as a group agreement ("In this game you are horrific Nazis and you will behave horrifically") any attempt by the GM to "get" the Players to do anything with any sort of clever and creative subterfuge invariable backfires as the Players quickly sniff out the GM's attempt to play a certain way and do everything they can NOT to do that thing.<br/><br/>My questions are these: <br/><br/>Give all you've written so far, what if you created, with your players, characters and character driven situations that allowed the Players to decide, within the context of a very wide and available moral spectrum, what they wanted their characters to do? Could you trust that if the choices were compelling that the choices would lead to great and fun play?<br/><br/>Given all you've written so far, why do you want to GM? From everything you've written I really get the feeling you want to be a PLAYER where you get to see what happens if you go all atrocious with your PC. Which is awesome in my view, but not what you're saying. You seem to keep exploring this one idea again and again: "What happens when the PCs become monsters, but of course I'm not playing one of the PCs."<br/><br/>I ask this second question because you seem to be walking down a line we've seen for a couple of decades -- when "story" meets "RPG" and the GM is really interested in seeing a story with characters that do "this" and "that" and it's really interesting and all... but, of course, he then hands the <i>his expectations of the characters to other people to play</i>. As stated above, things can fall apart really fast when one launches this way. <br/><br/>It strikes me you are really sincere in your desire to see what happens when a PC can be as morally flexible as the Player wants. But it also strikes me that you are the Player that wants to explore that.  You can't expect the other Players to explore these things for you. They are other people, with their own desires and moral interests and passions. <br/><br/>At this point it seems like you're ready to write another novel to explore these matters via a fictional character, or to step into the shoes of running your own PC as a Player.<br/><br/>But to "get" the Players to do anything on so vital and interesting a matter as moral decisions seems to me to be a losing proposition. Does this make sense? Do you have anyone who would be able to GM a few sessions of a game where you could be the Player and do things you've been writing about for weeks?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251138/#Comment_251138" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-16T11:19:23+00:00" title="January 16, 2010 11:19AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was playing a D&amp;D just after Fellowship of the Ring came out.

I'm not really all that interested in pushing players into it, though it would be an interesting exercise to create a situation where players are apt to go that way simply because it seems the most natural or expedient thing to do.<br/><br/>I'll admit I'm a little preoccupied with "bad guy" behavior and characterizations, largely because we see so little of it, at least in a self-aware way.  Most of the villainous behavior we get is of the kind I referenced before: kind of reflexive and only really apparent for what it is if we stop and unpack it from a remove.  This is quite different from knowingly and deliberately partaking in acts that run contrary to what we'd consider normative morality.<br/><br/>As far as playing this stuff out, I'd love to, but I'm generally stuck in a situation where I run games.  It's just the way it seems to shake out, so when I think about various and sundry situations it's often through the lens of GM presenting them to players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi" title="AnttiKi"><img alt="AnttiKi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.veljeskunta.info/anttiki/antti4_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi">AnttiKi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251222/#Comment_251222" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-17T22:12:17+00:00" title="January 17, 2010 10:12PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite> about what it takes to get players to tip over into the zone where they're committing heinous acts.</blockquote>\nWhat strikes me as peculiar as the rest of the text you wrote wasn't really about players committing heinous acts. I mean that for me, player doing anything in the context of the game is not really that bad in a moral way. Griefing and cheating are the most immoral things that I can think of in the context of play. To quote a friend of mine: "A pixel cannot feel pain".<br/><br/>So, the question you ask translates itself to me as 'How can I get my game to be about these certain kinds of acts and situations in my game that are most of the time left alone by the players?' <br/><br/>For me the first answer would be to discuss this with the players. Would they be interested in such a game? Why? Why not? Some players could be not interested, others may not want to play in that way because they think they are being judged by the fictional content they introduce, others may not be comfortable with this kind of content in their games at all.<br/><br/>In my opinion the prerequisites for covering any kind of delicate issues in a game are trust, motivation and interest. I wouldn't use any of the stealthy ways of 'let's drive them to act that way' but instead would try to provide a situation they could feel safe in addressing the issues they are interested in and also safe to introduce any kind of content they are interested in. Some of these methods would be strong separation between the fiction and the meta level of play (players may be discouraged if you comment on them committing heinous acts <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> and discussion on what are the subjects that players are absolutely not comfortable in play.<br/><br/>But still, for me it is all about the players. If they are not into it, they are not into it. You can influence them into acts of frustration like Judd described above but I don't think that that is what you are gunning for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251235/#Comment_251235" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T07:59:48+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  7:59AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wanmansou</cite>What strikes me as peculiar as the rest of the text you wrote wasn't really about players committing heinous acts.</blockquote>\nWell, if my discussion-starters have anything in common it's their tendency to wander around a point before getting to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
