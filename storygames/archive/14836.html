Everyone got really excited.  Then nothing happened.  Then people got excited again.  This is an attempt to make it go.<br/><br/>This is a thread for games set in that shared, collectively built world. Anyone can join in, but keep this thread clear of commentary.  It is for AP only.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>1. Choose a game<br/><br/>The campaign comes from actual play, so grab a game and start playing. You can use any system you\u2019d like, but to make coordination easier this is assumed to be a fantasy campaign, so pick something that will fit.<br/><br/>2. Start small<br/><br/>Build only what you need for you first session: small scale setting, situation, characters and maps. Leave large-scale politics, geography, and cosmology to develop as time goes on.  <br/><br/>3. Post Actual Play reports<br/><br/>Post descriptions of your play in this thread. Everything you contribute should come from play. The other participants will only have your AP to go on, so if you want to contribute something to the setting mention it in your report. Aim for AP about the length of a Bite Sized AP post, maybe two short paragraphs: one with an outline of the events in play, another with a list of important setting detail established during play.<br/><br/>4. Build on things others establish<br/><br/>Take the setting details from other people\u2019s AP and incorporate it into you own play.  As much as possible use \u201cYes, and \u2026\u201d as the template for your contributions.  When making up information about places that are far away or long ago, make up stories or rumours that might be true or might be false. Let your players or other groups find out which in play.<br/><br/>5. Build incrementally<br/><br/>Don\u2019t make large additions or changes to the setting at one go. Introduce new material a bit at a time and give other groups a chance to contribute to how things turn out.  No single session should radically change the setting as a whole. Keep even dramatic events relatively local so other groups have the option of including their effects in their part of the campaign or not.  Big changes should only come when multiple groups take up and build on the same material.<br/><br/>6. Have fun!<br/><br/>Make material that excites you because it will also excite others. This is a shared setting, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to reign in your imagination.  Go!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
