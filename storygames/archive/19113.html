Is there another Strange Fate-based game out there that might be a better option (a free option would be nice :-) )?<br/><br/>EDIT: Never mind this - I just learned browsing ArcDream's blog that Kereberos Club was part of the FATE Bundle of Holding - one of the games I didn't download because I wasn't interested at the time. So I just have to grab it from the Bundle page.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yasha" title="Yasha"><img alt="Yasha" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/535/nC2R7IBQNACRI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yasha">Yasha</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426628/#Comment_426628" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-05T12:56:43+00:00" title="January  5, 2014 12:56PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also an SRD available for Strange Fate -- <a href="http://arcdream.com/home/2012/10/strange-fate-system-reference-document-in-progress/" rel="nofollow">Info here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RedwoodR" title="RedwoodR"><img alt="RedwoodR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RedwoodR">RedwoodR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426629/#Comment_426629" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-05T13:39:07+00:00" title="January  5, 2014  1:39PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Yasha">@Yasha</a> - Thanks.

That said, I haven't read Kerberos Club, so I'm not 100% positive if that material is original to BR.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RedwoodR" title="RedwoodR"><img alt="RedwoodR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RedwoodR">RedwoodR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426678/#Comment_426678" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T13:29:17+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  1:29PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">@Joe_McGuffin</a> You're definitely right about rules for mash-up characters being important to the setting I'm looking at. As it happens, I was at my FLGS today and spotted Base Raiders on the "new stuff" shelf, so I grabbed it. (Figured a second perspective on the rules couldn't hurt, and it's nice to have hardcopy instead of PDF sometimes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
