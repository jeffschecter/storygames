Instead, I'll answer your second question (itself too wide to answer exhaustively all at once) by picking the first thing that comes to mind and focusing on that:<br/><br/>I'd say that the single most important rules element for sandbox campaigning is clarity on the envelope of potential goals that players may select for their characters over the long term. To me this means making the experience rules more robust and universal in nature; the default rules that assign an xp value to treasure and flirt with having "experience" measure in-fiction life-experience of characters has too many strange marginal cases that make it fracture in campaign play.<br/><br/>To fix this flaw that I perceive, I communicate the agenda precedence of play as clearly as possible. To wit, this is how the creative goals of the players should relate to each other from the more generic and abstract to more specific:<br/><br/>Want to experience the challenges of heroism in fantasy context -&gt; define characters with strategic goals within a milieu -&gt; determine score-keeping devices -&gt; select tactical goals -&gt; attempt to achieve goals, succeed or fail, gain score accordingly.<br/><br/>Traditionally D&amp;D explains this whole process in a more streamlined, simplified fashion:<br/><br/>Want to get your character to high level to get a castle -&gt; find an adventure location -&gt; slay and loot to gain experience points.<br/><br/>What this second, simplified model implies rules-wise is that experience points are the orienting motivation for players (that is, while players might have fun because of other things, they choose their course of action with xp in mind), and that those experience points are necessarily gained by looting dungeons. I find that while this is fine in the short term, for a longer sandbox campaign it is better if you can discuss the content of play more flexibly: the question is not just which dungeon to loot, but actually what kind of fun and exciting adventure content we desire to have in the game to begin with. And if necessary, we need to revise the xp system to support that other kind of play.<br/><br/>What all this means in practice is that I encourage and concur with the notion that gaining XP should be an orienting device for players, but I also think that this device should work with the players, not against them. Specifically, I never want to be in a situation where playing a character true to himself, while facing a legitimate challenge that we enjoy as content for play, causes a player to lose out on experience points. Some GMs enjoy these types of conundrums - should you take the treasure or give it back to its rightful owner, and so on; I think that it's a flaw in the game when players are forced to act like mercenary cut-throats because the game doesn't support other ways to advance.<br/><br/>A part of my approach is to accept that experience points are a score-keeping device and not anything real within the campaign setting: it is ultimately the cycle of challenge that causes experience points to be awarded, and things like learning by doing don't really come into it in any realistic and consistent sense. Thus it is possible to agree in the planning stages of an adventure that e.g. every rescued civilian is worth 100 xp for the party, like they were treasure parcels. Ready-made adventure modules often implicitly confess to this principle of scenario-based xp rewards by including various "quest xp" sources that are ultimately arbitrary in nature. Sometimes these quest xp sources are non-legitimate and arbitrary, as they reward things like "good roleplaying" instead of facing and overcoming challenges (the traditional format for this sort of thing is to give a big xp reward when characters decide to do something good and decent - bury an honorable foe, for example), but it's not uncommon to see perfectly fine applications of "freeform" xp, too.<br/><br/>By keeping focus on the idea that players strive to gain experience points, while simultaneously keeping the means flexible, we enable a sandbox campaign to breathe in the fiction: we have the opportunity to look around us in the fictional world we're developing, and ask ourselves what kind of potential for adventure (challenging and exciting events) exists within. In our campaign last year this meant traditional dungeoneering the majority of the time, but then there were also lengthy mercenary war episodes that would have been meaningless xp-wise if only treasures found in dungeons were counted xp-worthy. True freedom to discover your own adventure may only be found by realizing that xp is awarded for challenges, not just for treasure.<br/><br/>In practice the way I look at experience points is that players gain XP by declaring challenges in advance and then succeeding in them. In most dungeoneering adventures the challenge that players are taking on is implicit, and thus doesn't need to be pre-declared explicitly, but if players want to, they can re-negotiate the terms: just tell me in advance that your character does not want any treasure from this adventure, and we can work out some other measure of success instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405563/#Comment_405563" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T06:58:38+00:00" title="February  6, 2013  6:58AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a><br/>Thanks!

I'd say that it's not so much a question of how much you should have of either type of content, as it is a question of how much material the GM can juggle in the first place. All the GMing tools that we use to keep a handle on a sandbox setting are there to relieve certain bottlenecks that prevent us from just outright simulating an extremely complex world of adventure "for real" (as opposed to how we actually do it: we only imagine the immediate situation surrounding the player characters, and use various heuristic shortcuts to guesstimate the state of the rest of the setting). If your toolset and personal skills conjoin to create a world that has a lot of content, but it's passive, then that's a different campaign from the one that has relatively little content, but it's active in nature.<br/><br/>This might sound like a cop-out answer, as I don't recommend a specific amount or ratio of content for a sandbox campaign, but to me it seems like an intensely complex artistic question as to what kind of content your campaign setting is going to have at all: there is no right or wrong answer to something like that, because it depends in the first place on what your skills actually enable you to do. Those skills also determine which tools you can use to improve on your set-up, so I can't even directly recommend using hex maps, zoned geography, relationship geography, random encounters, special encounters, prepped arbitrary encounters, adventure locations, microdungeons, NPC prep, or any other tools you might care to name that have been used in running sandbox campaigns. The campaign in its entirety has its own unique set of tools and practices, and that set, when properly developed, is optimal for the specific GM and group, and the focus of their play.<br/><br/>To pick an example of what I mean by the personal uniqueness of the proper sandbox toolset, I'll reveal that I still haven't built proper overland random encounter tables for my campaign. This is something that I'd like to do, because I like doing random encounters in dungeons, but I just haven't had the time. So what I end up doing instead of random encounters off statistically realistic tables is an alternative set-up that takes less work, one that might be called "improvised special encounters": whenever a random encounter is indicated in the campaign, I select an appropriate semi-random idea off a constantly evolving list of possible encounters, and run that. It's a less objective method of determining and introducing white noise into the landscape of the campaign, but it's also more flavourful (because basically it's guaranteed that I'm going to improvise a more flavourful encounter off some unique notes rather than "2d6 orcs" or whatever), and more significantly, it's a method that I actually have the tools for right now instead of some theoretical future time when I've finished my random encounter tables.<br/><br/>When I compare my sandboxing methodology with other GMs, we always have massive differences in the specific set of tools we use. Very often the tools others use are completely legitimate in my eyes, I could be doing that same thing if I'd thought of it, or if it didn't partially overstep on some other tool I happen to be already using, or if it wasn't psychologically counter-intuitive for me. People have so different skills and preferences that it's no wonder at all that the practical field applications they end up with differ widely. Some are better at diligent preparation, others are great at improvisation, and so on.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that it is entirely legitimate to have your sandbox involve only passive concerns, especially at the beginning: you never need to have actively developing fronts (a good term to borrow from AW, that), especially if you're stylistically in a very hardcore place, a campaign that revolves around a band of ne'er-do-wells in a cynical and neutral world where they're just trying their best to survive and thrive. On the other hand, I could see an entirely legitimate sandbox campaign that didn't have a passive baseline of adventuring options at all: all content the GM preps is ephemeral and potentially constantly shifting.<br/><br/>Now that I think of it, while my current campaign is more on the passive content side (due to the adventure modules I use for most of the content), only going active after players provoke some events, the D&amp;D campaign I ran a decade back in Helsinki was the very opposite methodologically: there were no static adventure locations at all, there was just an ever-shifting rumour landscape where events came and went, and it was up to the players to grasp at the fleeting material to piece together an adventure.<br/><br/>Remember that a challenge-based sandbox campaign doesn't need to have a huge amount of content to be legitimate: it just needs to present an initial situation that the players have buy-in for, and it needs to provide a credible strategic context in which the players can make choices as to which content they wish to engage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405683/#Comment_405683" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-07T14:28:07+00:00" title="February  7, 2013  2:28PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of the fun points of confluence among "choose your own path" and "think tactically" is "choose <i>where</i> to employ tactics".  In a way, the entire available setting is a resource list for the players to choose from:<br/>- Let's set a trap in the room with the portal!<br/>- Let's hurry and sneak over to the armory before they know the castle's been infiltrated!<br/>- Let's lure the badguys to the clearing where we can take pot-shots at them from the trees!<br/>- Let's drag the corpses from the dungeon in here and walk on them to cross the lava!<br/><br/>The tried and true GM method for supporting this seems to be sticking a few pre-made tactical challenge locations vaguely near each other, and coming up with a reason why the characters can't simply leave, recharge, and come back whenever they want, such that there's pressure on the characters to ration out their resources like spells and hitpoints etc.<br/><br/>I was just, thinking, though, that I might enjoy GMing this more if I spent less time building discreet challenges and problems and constraints, and just rolled for opportunities for each new location.  Threats come in the form of agents the GM controls -- monsters and NPCs -- and it's up to the players to pick how best to confront these threats, using the available options which include location.<br/><br/>So, first, come up with the opposition.<br/><br/>Then, whenever the PCs enter a new physical space, roll on some tables that define relevant features in general terms, and then flesh them out with specific color.<br/><br/>I suspect that'd do it.<br/><br/>The roll-on table could include things like:<br/>- good hiding spot<br/>- high ground<br/>- lever, pulley, and great weight<br/>- closeable gate<br/>- narrow path<br/>- darkness<br/>- incessant noise<br/>- hanging ropes<br/>- native clothing<br/>- chained beast                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
