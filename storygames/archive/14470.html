Like Bible themes + Conan action + Klarion clothes + Cold War society.  Like if the English Civil War (or the Thirty Years War) was being fought with dragon-tanks and mind-breaking angelic hallucinogens.  I <i>definite</i> see Old West style locomotives halted on tracks that used to lead to Sodom.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe....<br/>\nThe Garden of Eden was an experimental laboratory testing and vivisecting the man-apes, who were fatted up and kept comfortably sedated during their (unwitting) incarceration.  A demon of some kind induced the man-apes to undergo a type of neurological uplift leading to self-awareness (and "Humanity" as a game mechanic).  The uplifted creatures were eventually ejected from the laboratory.  It's possible that there's some kind of wild animal in this setting that's exactly like humans physically, but just hasn't clicked on mentally/spiritually, they're simply beasts.  And under conditions of extreme emotional/spiritual stress, the uplift mutation undoes itself--you end up as a brutal, unthinking, cannibalistic animal living in the wilds.

How about <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6&amp;version=NIV" rel="nofollow">the time the Angels knocked up a bunch of human women, producing heroic super-people</a>?\n<blockquote>When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. Then the LORD said, \u201cMy Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.\u201d<br><br>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days\u2014and also afterward\u2014when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.<br><br>The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. So the LORD said, \u201cI will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created\u2014and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground\u2014for I regret that I have made them.\u201d But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nThere's a strong implication that the "wickedness" that causes God to cleanse humanity in a flood is none other than the Angel-human mating that produces monstrous/heroic demihumans. Like God feels threatened by the new super-race, maybe?<br><br>Kind of like <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11&amp;version=NIV" rel="nofollow">the time King Nimrod united all the peoples of earth in a bold plan to invade Heaven, and God fractured their civilization because they just might pull it off</a>.\n<blockquote>Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. As people moved eastward,[a] they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.<br> They said to each other, \u201cCome, let\u2019s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.\u201d They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then they said, \u201cCome, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.\u201d<br><br>But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The LORD said, \u201cIf as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.\u201d<br><br>So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel\u2014because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.</br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nOr hey, you're not up on your Garden of Eden? Let's back up and talk about <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3&amp;version=NIV" rel="nofollow">how mankind, under the Serpent's tutelage, attained enlightenment and God cast them out of the primordial paradise lest they usurp his place</a>.\n<blockquote>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, \u201cDid God really say, \u2018You must not eat from any tree in the garden\u2019?\u201d The woman said to the serpent, \u201cWe may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, \u2018You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.\u2019\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou will not certainly die,\u201d the serpent said to the woman. \u201cFor God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\u201d</br></br></blockquote>\n<blockquote>And the LORD God said, \u201cThe man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.\u201d So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.</blockquote>\nAnd not long after that, their son Cain's sacrifices were rejected by God while his brother's were accepted, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4&amp;version=NIV" rel="nofollow">so he committed the first murder, causing a taint upon the land, and recieved a divine mark to protect him from humanity's retribution</a>.\n<blockquote>Now Cain said to his brother Abel, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the field.\u201d While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.<br><br>Then the LORD said to Cain, \u201cWhere is your brother Abel?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d<br><br>The LORD said, \u201cWhat have you done? Listen! Your brother\u2019s blood cries out to me from the ground. Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother\u2019s blood from your hand. When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.\u201d<br><br>Cain said to the LORD, \u201cMy punishment is more than I can bear. Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.\u201d<br><br>But the LORD said to him, \u201cNot so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.\u201d Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. So Cain went out from the LORD\u2019s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nThat oughtta get you started. And that shit's just the opening chapters--the prologue, really, for the main plot of Abraham, Moses and King David. I recommend reading Genesis, bits of Exodus, and the book of Daniel for some core weirdness. You can also dip into Joshua, Judges and Ezekiel for some juicy stuff. And of course in the New Testament you've got the Revelation of John, which is where people usually go for some Biblical Freakout material. but I say don't neglect the Old Testament; it's got some great trippy stuff.<br><br/>I was raised Baptist, so I don't know from Apocrypha.

A priest consecrates the wafer, which transubstatiates into the literal flesh of Jesus Christ, and then the wafer is burnt as fuel which can make faster-than-light travel possible. Schisms in the church mean that some branches see it as the worst blasphemy to use the flesh of god that way, and others see it as a gift from heaven.<br/><br/>The ships fly around, still taking many years to complete their journeys, run like little flying monastaries. There are wooden planets, pykrete space stations, prison hulks, peasant farmers, and space-libraries. There are religious conflicts over the use of the communion. There are atheists dealing with incontrivertable proof of the existance of god - or of some kind of thing. There are the ruins of alien civilisations, vast and incomprehensible.<br/><br/>The issues are things like: "What if there is objective morality, and it goes against everything you believe?" "What if there was proof of the existance of a deity, but it wasn't what people expected?" "What if progress isn't always good?"<br/><br/>Maybe play it with Sorcerer? Or maybe Dogs?

Giant fish, two headed men from beneath the earth, a man born from a statue, and a rabbi who can <i>sing so well that your head will explode.</i><br/><br/>A lot of weird stuff sprang up around the edges of Judaic/Christian culture, but never is directly mentioned in the Bible.  The story of Satan being a fallen angel, kicked out of Heaven for rebelling?  That's totally extra-Biblical.  So there's a lot of other material out there to draw from as well, like the Jewish mystical sources cited at the above link, or the Gnostic Gospels.  (E.g., St. Thomas Aquinas said that angels and devils all have perfect knowledge of everything that happened and will happen, which is why you cannot beat any one of them in a theological debate.)<br/><br/>Which isn't to say that some judicious Google searching for weird Bible Verses is a bad idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329403/#Comment_329403" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T11:44:39+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 11:44AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a comedic talking donkey sidekick in the book of Numbers (22:21-29).<br/><br/>And a golden dildo at Ezekiel 16:17.<br/><br/>God moons Moses at Exodus 33:23.<br/><br/>Since God is unable to harm people inside iron chariots (Judge 1:19), you get <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.atheism/msg/58c1d61cbac28ecb?as_umsgid=ajgtt9$i9@nntpb.cb.lucent.com&amp;pli=1" rel="nofollow">this modern extrapolation of how angels would fare fighting against tanks</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Iskander" title="Iskander"><img alt="Iskander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.ajnewman.net/i/eye.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Iskander">Iskander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329426/#Comment_329426" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T12:46:47+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 12:46PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you can get a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outrageous-Tales-Testament-Tony-Bennett/dp/0861660544" rel="nofollow">Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament</a>, it's worth a look.
