<p>So, over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1979" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, we talked about different sorts of setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>One kind of setting's really easy because it relies on stuff we already know about, i.e. common knowledge, like "ninjas" or "robot pirate island" or whatever. (I really don't like to call this setting, but my usage isn't really important here.)</li>
<li>Then there's some other kinds of setting that rely on specialised knowledge, like WWII or TÃ©kumel or what have you.</li>
<li>Then there's the kind of setting that can't be written down, because it <em>does not</em> rely on preexisting knowledge. It arises in play. (Notice, this isn't precisely the same as setting accreting from a core of a known set of tropes, as like a "ninjas" game might accrete setting and eventually turn into a territory war between Razor Scream Mountain and the ninja clan of Battle Hill.) I'm gonna call this novel setting for the purposes of this thread, in contrast to common setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>That third sort is the kind of setting that I'm interested in talking about here. I am specifically <em>not</em> interested in talking about why you'd want to do this or why preexisting knowledge is awesome or any of that. That belongs in other threads. Now, clearly, novel setting is related to those other two extremes, and I don't think that they are completely separable</p>
<p>So, talk about your experiences of novel setting here, or techniques for bringing it about.</p>
<p><strong>In my experience,</strong> there is a HeroQuest game that I play with Thomas and Mike and recently Danielle, in which we are each responsible for our PC's homeland. Our homelands sometimes rely on external knowledge - mine's coloured by a sort of romantic mental image I have of medieval Mongolia - but they are not constricted by it, and they have a great field of forced novelty - their places of contact. We constantly have to think about what happens when customs clash, and the conflicts or coping strategies that arise from this. It makes the game very rich.</p>
<p>It's amazing and exciting to play with ideas about what one culture does when it touches another, and without that, the game would be a lot less fun for me.</p>

                            Shreyas - is novel setting just a sub-set of "simple common setting", just one with feather-light constraints prior to play?  Because that kind of sounds like the example you're giving.  (I'm assuming, without having played it, that HeroQuest assumes certain things about the imaginary world.)                        </div>

                            Fine, fine... I guess I don't see the hang-up.  What you're talking about, I think, is the major purpose of "Sorcerer &amp; Sword"--which is to generate just enough of a sketchy bare-bones framework of a setting, and then attach stuff to it authoritatively through play.  If we're talking about something else, please correct me.<br/>
<br/>
Basically it's handled through identifying some kind of genre, plopping down a couple of facts, a couple of stylistic notes--"Like this, but not like that"--and then improvising.  There was a pretty good thread--I think it was on SG--about someone's sci-fi game, where the GM essentially had three principles which guided his improvisation, and led to what felt like (to the players) to be a very consistent and satisfying setting after all.  It sounds like you're talking about something like this, just with everyone chipping in, not just the GM.                        </div>

                            I love this stuff, Shreyas, and this is my default setting preference for play.  In our current PTA game, we're in a clockwork pseudo-London; we only develop details of the setting as they become necessary, and it doesn't upset any applecarts doing so.  It's how I like to play everything from World of Darkness games (making up random duchies in Nebraska) to Full Light, Full Steam (where the rules support making shit up as you go).  Actually, <a href="http://kallistipress.com/?q=node/2" rel="nofollow">Conquer the Horizon</a> is a game designed around making that setting-building the core of play.  <a href="http://kallistipress.com/?q=node/11" rel="nofollow">Sailing for Atlantis</a> does this too, for that matter.<br><br>For me, the real key thing is that the generated setting needs to have some essential link to the characters being played; this can be homelands like your example, or it can be the settings for situations that will challenge the charactes in a new kind of way.  I think this sort of play goes off the rails (and in a bad way) when the players start making stuff up just to make stuff up.  That's great fun, but it's a different kind of game, and you wander out of roleplaying territory and into, I dunno, worldbuilding.  This is why the "you play gods of a classical world that you create" meme that keeps cropping up from time to time in the First Thoughts boards and elsewhere never quite grabs me -- there aren't characters to get a good handle on the setting to make it do something interesting besides, you know, sit there.                        </br></br></div>

For now I'll just say that while I may not agree with S's break down point by point, I see what he's getting at and its something well worth talking about. Rather than angels on the head of a pinning the exact definitions of things, I think focusing on the ties between character, world building, and shared authority may help me. <br/><br/>S, what areas do you want to focus on?

<p>Yeah, I was thinking about how my initial post doesn't pin this stuff down well.</p>
<p>I know that, in real play, we do create setting bits that are not based on preexisting knowledge. (For a particular value of 'based on' that is not easy to define.) What I'm interested in are tools - ways to avoid or destroy 'dead' setting, ways to constrain novel setting such that it's useful and fun to <em>create</em> as well as to play in (I'm sure that you can simply say things like, "Tell me something directly relevant to the characters that describes the principal exports of Nowheresville", but that is the opposite of fun for me), ways to partition authority in functional and equitable ways, etc.</p>
<p>Let's not mince theory here. If we want to talk about definitions, take it to another thread. This, here, is only experience and craft.</p>

                            I think (or at least speculate) that one of the keys to this may be that players are provided with resources to create mechanically significant setting. In other words, if you want to have something influence conflict resolution, you gotta pay for it (but you're encouraged to do that).<br/><br/>The example I give in the latest revision of City of Masks is that you can spend some of your resources on a Proper Action (= attribute) for your mask that says "I lead a gang of bully-boys". The gang of bully-boys then becomes usable in the resolution mechanism. Anyone else can also say "I have a posse" or whatever, but unless they spend resources on it, it's colour only - it doesn't affect resolution.<br/><br/>I realize, Shreyas, that the games you design often are a bit outside the square and this may not be directly relevant to you.                        </div>

<p>Mike, this is very cool. Can you tell us a little about how it works in play? Do you get the same contrast that you do in HeroQuest, between a character that has "I have a gang" as an ability and a character that doesn't? (I find this contrast really hard to describe, but it's palpable.)</p>

                            Unfortunately I haven't been in a position to playtest it yet. When I do, I'll let you know.<br/><br/>It could just as well be "I'm a member of an international order of assassins" or "My uncle is Captain of the Guard" or "I have a handbag dog", of course. You want the handbag dog to bite someone as part of conflict resolution, you need to spend the points on it. And it will be exactly as useful to you as the points you spend.                        </div>

                            How about what Seth does with Legends of Alyria?  There's a lot of setting in the game text itself, but it's left deliberately left open for the players to create setting in play.  Most importantly, he provides 'motifs'  to use in the construction of setting elements that help it all fit together cohesively.                        </div>

                            As Shreyas admits, actually there's always a lot of shared world to start, no matter what. I call what we do with Hero Quest with no setting to start "OtherWorld." What's interesting about it, however, is how we have to rely on words to understand the world we're creating. And how, in doing that, you automatically rely on shared experience.<br/>
<br/>
This starts out at the lowest levels. Skip the fact that Shreyas is working off of a Medieval Mongolian Romantic vision for his character's homeland for a moment, and let's just start with the fact that in the character's description there's the use of the pronoun "he." OK, so Shreya's character is male. But male what? We've never explicitly establilshed that he's human - but I'm pretty sure he is. Basically this is an automatic default assumption. But then there are context clues. I know he walks, he has arms, and a whole host of information from play that confirms that he's human.<br/>
<br/>
But he could be an elf. He's never mentioned his ears or whether or not they're pointy. But at this point, if, in fact, he decided to mention his character's pointy ears, Thomas and I would probably call foul. Unless he described his character as wearing his hair long specifically to hide it or something. Because it would be strange for my human character not to have reacted at all to his character's elfish-ness if it had been visible all the time.<br/>
<br/>
So there are definitely default assumptions that get made. The fact that he walks, and does not propell himself around by some other means indicates that there is gravity operating. The fact that they've been said to breathe hard indicates that there is air, and that the are air-breathing beings. Again, this is not established by the narration that says these things - only confirmed by it. Shreyas never thought to make a non-air-breathing being as his character.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the term "OtherWorld" is actually apt, then. What it's saying is essentially, "Like our world, except for the ways in which we establish that it's not like our world." So the characters are human by default. There is air and gravity. There are horses - and they so far act like real world horses. I mention this last because it's something that could easily be changed. We could all ride giant lizards instead. But we don't, we ride horses.<br/>
<br/>
This last part is established first by Shreyas' description of his homeland as being nomads who ride horses, and then followed up by the fact that my character has a horse that he uses to pull his cart around. Aha, there are carts! And so on and on it goes.<br/>
<br/>
What the homelands do in the HQ rules is to establish one of the most variable things in a world - the nature of the cultures in the world. It does so not only because it's interesting to play to know this stuff (since, as mentioned, the characters are linked), but also simply to understand some things about potential themes. That is, there's no reason that high tech cultures couldn't be introduced. There is an assumption in OtherWorld that it's a fantasy place. But many fantasy worlds have technology - see Final Fantasy. So far, our world doesn't have any high tech elements per se, but it does have magic in abundance enough to actually replicate some of the effects of high tech. For instance, I proposed a city of a half billion people. When asked how it manages to stay intact, I cavalierly threw out, "Must be the magic."<br/>
<br/>
So I've introduced a place where the topics of overpopulation and anarchy and such can be important in play.<br/>
<br/>
So I think that's what we've got:<br/>
<br/>
It's our world, except for the cultures, and the cultures exist to provide background themes from which to develop new themes.<br/>
<br/>
Then on a more micro-level, each character has an occupation. These exist then to further narrow potential themes. As do the magic keywords they have. The former to relate to social issues, the latter to relate to more philosophical issues (and, of course, all three cross over to affect each other).<br/>
<br/>
What doing this "Otherworld" style does is to constrict the themes involved to only those that players see fit to introduce in the keywords and abilities that are given to characters. At GenCon, Judd, and the Durham 3 (or is Jason's group another?) sat in on this game, and in short order created Basilisk Ranching as not only a set of occupations, but with a whole ethos and pathos around it - a subculture. Very greek tragedy. Since that introduction, even though those guys haven't played again, that's left an indelible mark on the world, since that stuff has been established though those characters and their keywords.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't limited to the players, of course, Thomas as Narrator for the game introduces stuff all the time to fit his whims. Recently he mucked around with Shreyas' character's religion (with Shreyas colaborating, IIRC), in creating these destroyer cultists. Who's sacrifice-the-virgin-priestess-to-the-dark tea-party we upset recently (oh, there will be repercussions no doubt). So the narrator is adding things in, too.<br/>
<br/>
What there isn't is any canon to the setting saying, "Oh, that's problematic, because the destroyer cult is part of a larger organization about rebeling in the city that would have been in the picture." We haven't had an urge so far to introduce those thematic elements, so we haven't. That's not to say we couldn't or won't. Merely that there's no set of information telling us that X exists that should be included for consistency's sake.<br/>
<br/>
Now, actually, I like canon to some extent. I won't get off on that tangent. But the point is that this is the advantage to this sort of play. It's not so much that you're free to create what you want, as that you're free from thematic information being introduced pro forma. You only get what you want.<br/>
<br/>
That helpful?<br/>

<p>I'd love to do that, if we had formal, well-described techniques for it. I'm not sure that we do, and I'm unprepared to play anthropologist and do a study of how it works with informal, unreliabe procedures.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>So, over in<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1979" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, we talked about different sorts of setting.One kind of setting's really easy because it relies on stuff we already know about, i.e. common knowledge, like "ninjas" or "robot pirate island" or whatever. (I really don't like to call this setting, but my usage isn't really important here.)Then there's some other kinds of setting that rely on specialised knowledge, like WWII or TÃ©kumel or what have you.Then there's the kind of setting that can't be written down, because it<em>does not</em>rely on preexisting knowledge. It arises in play. (Notice, this isn't precisely the same as setting accreting from a core of a known set of tropes, as like a "ninjas" game might accrete setting and eventually turn into a territory war between Razor Scream Mountain and the ninja clan of Battle Hill.) I'm gonna call this novel setting for the purposes of this thread, in contrast to common setting.That third sort is the kind of setting that I'm interested in talking about here. I am specifically<em>not</em>interested in talking about why you'd want to do this or why preexisting knowledge is awesome or any of that. That belongs in other threads. Now, clearly, novel setting is related to those other two extremes, and I don't think that they are completely separable</blockquote>
... in fact, the Amber game I ran, Born to be Kings (which gave birth to Fate), was a hybrid of novel setting and, uh, the setting of the novels.  There was definitely a lot of "common knowledge" in the playgroup -- we were all very familiar with Amber -- but I opened up Amber and its environs entirely for the players to define -- the territories, squabbling houses, all that.  Definitely made for a crazy-rich game.<br><br><a href="http://www.iago.net/amber/kings/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.iago.net/amber/kings/</a> is CHOCK full of material from that.                        </br></br></div>
