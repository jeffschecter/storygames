I am looking for some advice and/or help. Google Docs doesn't allow you to publish PDFs at the moment so I am stuck using e-mail. If you would like Book 1 I'll send it to you. For those that already e-mailed me I'll fire off the new version. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic premise of Wanderer is to use the CT and Mongoose system for a fantasy game. The idea is keep with CT style of system: Random tables for character generation and world generation, uses tables as a narrative tool, simple mechanics. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith all that in mind here is where I need some help:<br/>\nCombat section: Any ideas? I am beating my head against the wall trying to figure out how to make a smooth running combat. Right now it's in sorry shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo the tables for character generation make sense, what about the narrative process for character creation?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould anyone like to write up the section on player priorities?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Book 1 convey the themes of wandering (I know it might not without Book 3), going to far down the hero's path and not being able to return?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other ideas input would be welcomed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171808/#Comment_171808" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T18:49:10+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  6:49PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will read the doc tomorrow, see what I toss your way in a few days                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
