And what's in it? Translations?</blockquote>\nThis is the book: "Bakabaka RPG wo Kataru", or "Tales of Wacky RPGs"<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lsqME2X6L._SS500_.jpg"/><br/><br/>The story behind this book is this, from GenCon 2004 IIRC:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.robo-christ.com/gallery/streamimage.php?path=L2Ryb3ogZm9yZ2Vib290aC9ub25hbWUtNi5qcGc="/><br/>-----<br/>side notes first: <br/>There's Jonathan Tweet! ; <br/><br/>The girl in the white shirt was cute, and she was a new employee of "Group SNE" out of college (lit degree). She was a staff writer, but had never played an RPG before joining the company. Since then, she pretty much flipped out on geek culture, playing RPGs and enjoying them, and even later wearing fantasy costumes at GenCon. ;<br/><br/>The guy barely visible in the blue shirt I met for the first time that day, but we became friends. He's Kei Kitazawa, and recently released a line for an action-horror RPG called "Demon Parasite".<br/>------<br/><br/>So that guy with the glasses on the far right: Akira Tomono. He's a gaming Methuselah in Japan, has been pretty much on the scene from the beginning. He's founded his own gaming company, and at the same time is the pres (IIRC) of "Group SNE", a company that releases the original Japanese fantasy RPG "Sword World", but mostly focuses on translating GURPS and other SJGames board/card games into English, and running national gaming events.<br/><br/>When he came to the booth that year (and in later years) he was looking for games to talk about in his monthly columns for "Role and Roll", one of the few gaming periodicals. The book above is a compilation of his articles. Anyway, he was looking for "Bakabaka RPGs". There was a bit of a communication issue at first, because I know "baka" (means "stupid" or "silly", with a usually lighter tone), but didn't realize until explanation that in this case the whole "Bakabaka" thing is kind like how we here use "Nerd/Nerdy": A combination of "wacky, geeky and Awesome". In other words, he was collecting, reading, and showing off (in Japan) various wacky/crazy/awesome western/American RPGs in an air of fun and enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hooked him up with about $300 worth of stuff that year, and in later years he came back for more. Later, he would write articles about the games he bought, both mainstream and indie, and even did seminars at Cons where he would talk about the games.  Again, it was all in the spirit of fun, the only games that got genuinely poked fun at (still, in a good-natured ribbing sense) were ones that focused on Eastern/Asian culture and somehow missed the mark.<br/><br/>I don't have the book with me now (at work on break in between training sessions today), but here's a list from memory of some of the games featured in the book/articles:<br/><br/>Twilight 2000<br/>Macho Women With Guns<br/>Paranoia<br/>All Flesh Must Be Eaten<br/>Sketch<br/>Breaking the Ice (he actually played it, too!)<br/>My Life With Master<br/>Slayers d20<br/>BESM<br/>OVA<br/>Trollbabe<br/>Elfs<br/>Tibet<br/>L5R<br/>Fastlane<br/>Bushido<br/>Hong Kong Action Theater<br/>Feng Shui<br/>Ninja Burger<br/>Kobolds Ate My Baby<br/><br/>Anyway, the book is pretty much a series of 1/2 to 3 page articles, reviews, some (few) play reports, and an actual play "Replay" excerpt from a Slayers d20 game. I haven't gotten through the whole book yet, but it's an easy, light read.<br/><br/>My takeaways from it:<br/>* Interesting bits of culture clash, particularly when dealing with American-made Asian RPGs.<br/>* It's a good-natured roundup of a wide variety of major and minor games that have never made it to Japan.<br/>* I kinda want to make a similar set of articles about Japanese games.

So, that's a pretty Japanese analogy.</blockquote>\nThey actually seem to straddle both Ainu and Native American (in the "Terra the Gunslinger" book, a Steampunk American Western analogue world that happens "on the other side of the planet from Tenra", the Oni are there again, this time called "Ogres" IIRC. Same horns and culture and everything).<br/><br/>But yeah, there's lots of fun stereotypes of the West in Japanese RPGs:<br/><br/>* Everyone is packing, always. (then again, this is often a convention of US RPGs, too :-)  )<br/>* Nuns and Priests even regularly pack heat to shoot at dudes for Christ.<br/>* Edison is the most important person in America, Ever. Always.  <br/>(You know how we look at Japan and see "ninjas and samurai"? When Japan looks at the US they see Thomas Edison) <br/>* Everyone is white.<br/>-- Collary: Sometimes, it's just *almost* everyone.<br/>* Police get in shootouts and car chases every day (again, though, our games are often the same).<br/>* Everyone eats steak all the time. It's often the only menu item.<br/>* American businessmen always yell a lot and use emotion and big talk to coerce and get their way.<br/>* All priests are catholic<br/>* Many priests are crazy loners who wear candles strapped to their heads and perform superstitious curse magic.<br/><br/>Those are the ones that hit off the top of my head.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69982/#Comment_69982" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T08:46:26+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  8:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That. is. awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72930/#Comment_72930" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T13:30:58+00:00" title="May 31, 2007  1:30PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having just found this thread I am compelled to ask:  what sort of mention did <b>Fastlane</b> get?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72933/#Comment_72933" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T13:44:49+00:00" title="May 31, 2007  1:44PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>So that guy with the glasses on the far right: Akira Tomono . . .  focuses on translating GURPS and other SJGames board/card games into English</blockquote>\nMan, I wish his stuff got printed over here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
