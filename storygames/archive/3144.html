Most, however, focus on altering the character's state of mind - which will, of course, affect the player. Here are a few techniques from my Itras By campaign:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Suggestive countdown ritual</b>. At the start of the session, all players close their eyes and start a countdown - aloud - from 10 to 1. In between each number, the GM speaks a short sentence or a word, designed to evoke imagery, activate the imagination processes, get the symbol-processing parts of the mind to gear up. These phrases also point towards things that might happen in the session.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example:<br/>\n10. A metal apple.<br/>\n9. A leaf falls from a tree, twirling in the wind.<br/>\n8. A paper falls from a window, twirling in the wind.<br/>\n7. You can feel the rain on your tongue.<br/>\n6. Who's that, flying?<br/>\n5. It's warm under the coat.<br/>\n4. The metal squeaks.<br/>\n3. The smell of coffee.<br/>\n2. The smell of roast pig.<br/>\n1. On top of the Moon Tower, Nindra rests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Rue du Roi</b>. Named after a street in Itras By where the surreal takes over. One player controls his/her character as per usual; the other three play the character's longings, fears and self-image, respectively. The main player is not informed of what will happen before the scene starts. The other players can control objects, NPCs and events as they see fit. Perhaps the weather changes to reflect the main character's fears; perhaps he/she sees him/herself in a mirror.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Flashbacks from an alternate reality</b>. The same scene is played several times, with a major NPC (confronting a character) played by a different player each time. All versions of the scene are equally true, and have taken place in the character's memory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Text vs reality</b>. In the game, there's a book chronicling the life of one of the PCs - events that have happened, that might happen, that never happened. At a dinner among strangers, with a pretty girl serving, the PC starts remembering a text about this speficic event. However, in the text, the PC performs horrible actions. While the player plays through the dinner in a "straight" fashion, the other players "read" (that is, invent) pieces of text from the book, that the PC remembers. So, for example, while he's eating the main course and trying to have a chat with the businessman next to him, he remembers how the book describes him raping the serving girl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue" title="Metal Fatigue"><img alt="Metal Fatigue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://msen.com/~sethb/xkcd-sqrt-love.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue">Metal Fatigue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71930/#Comment_71930" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T17:40:31+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  5:40PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy crap!

But to me the structures in Mridangam and Waiting/Tea, specifically the way the narrative is structured so that you can move back and forth in it as if you move pieces on a board, seem to require a similar sort of... cognitive leap, or shifting of the mental frame, from the players as tactical resource management does. <br><br>(Also, an IRC discussion with Shreyas a while ago has left me pretty sure we don't see eye to eye when it comes to playing styles).<br><br>I'm quite open for further discussion and attempts at defining this vague "cognitive leap" stuff, if you're interested.

Why or why not?</blockquote>\nI see what you mean. Well, yes, it can definitely be a hippie method game, in my book. Hippie methods are very open to unconventional divisions of traditional GM functions and authority. The reason I talk about players and GM in the four examples (suggestive countdown, rue du roi, flashbacks from an alternate reality + text vs reality) is that they're all taken from my Itras By campaign, which by default has a traditional GM/player setup. However, many of the methods I've tried out there (along with other methods already in the game text) specifically change that setup, challenge it, play around with it. <br><br>There are, for instance, "chance cards" that players can draw - each player once every session. One of those cards requires the GM to give his/her notes to the player to his/her left, who is then the GM for the rest of the session.<br><br>The main thing about hippie method GM functions + authority is probably this: A setup where there'\xc2\xa8s a GM who controls just about everything (contents of setting, situation, resolution [GM fiat]) <i>all the time</i> is antithetical to hippie methods. However, a setup with rotating GMs, division of GM power etc is almost a requirement for hippie methods - it's part of what I mean by "communal creation".                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72228/#Comment_72228" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T16:32:58+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  4:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><br>Well, since this is a description of my personal design philosophy, I'm not sure whether we actually<i>can</i>disagree on it - but we can certainly have different tastes and philosophies!<br/></br></blockquote>\nI completely misunderstood the intent of this discussion.

It is, of course, just a personal preference; at the same time, it seems to be one that I share with many self-proclaimed immersionists, freeformers, jeepformers and LARPers. <br><br><b>Why I want to minimize the amount of resource handling in my games</b><br><br>Resource handling systems are logistics I don't want. I understand how they work to make a story; I like playing games with them sometimes, for the <i>end results</i> they provide. I see how Capes can end up making players listen closely to each other and provide good antagonism, or why Nicotine Girls' smoking rules are cool. However, the end doesn't justify the means - in this case, breaking the flow of the game.<br><br>Resource handling is, to me, a speed bump in the playing process. It makes me stop and think: "What if I use this point in this fashion? How will that affect what I can do in the future? What <i>do</i> I want to do in the future?" Instead, I want to think: "I need to do this thing. How can I express it? What actions should I take? What emotions am I going through?"<br><br>Resource handling also makes it easy to fall for "story point greed" - if I'm not sure exactly what I want, I can at least keep my options open by maxing out on tokens I can use later. (Like choosing what job you want based on what you might earn, instead of what job you actually like). Why use or abuse the system? Because it's <i>there</i>, and I'm human.<br><br>Finally, resource handling requires an added layer of explanation and understanding. When playing with (or designing for) others, if I use resource handling systems, not only do I have to explain the rules of the game, I also have to explain their implications. If not, players may easily have a bad experience the first time they play, because they don't get how the game works. "You mean just because I used the McGuffin point in scene 1, my protagonist has to become a slave to the Spider King in scene 5? Where does it say that?" "It doesn't. It just follows from the rules."<br><br><b>Dice</b><br><br>Dice, in and of themselves, aren't good or bad. However, they are very often used in resolution systems that tie in with resource handling systems, which I want to avoid. Other uses are for rolling up stuff on tables (which is old-skool); I'd rather use cards for that sort of randomization. <br><br><b>Resolution systems</b><br><br>Still thinking about those.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72280/#Comment_72280" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T01:14:24+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  1:14AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs,<br><br>Is this manifesto an "all of the time" thing, or a "sometimes" thing?
