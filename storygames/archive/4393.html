Then you play the scene.  Now, when we play in our Conservancy of Gears game, we get to the end of any given scene and only like half the time is the scene actually about that agenda.  Half the time that "what's happening" was just the sort of seed for the scene, and the Producer threw in some other stuff that quickly shifted the spotlight to other matters.  But the kicker is, the other half of the time, the scene really is about that stuff, and the spotlight stays trained on the "agenda."<br/><br/>This makes me wonder if perhaps there are two things at work, here: a scene agenda, the thing that the scene is about, and the scene pretense, which is sort of the spur for getting the scene started that is not necessarily important to the scene.  In requesting a scene, you're actually stipulating the scene pretense, which may turn out to be the scene's agenda, or it may turn out to be just that: a pretense for getting the action going.<br/><br/>I am reminded of a <em>West Wing</em> episode where the script needed Bartlett and Leo to talk.  They needed a pretense to have the two of the very busy guys alone in a room together.  So Leo walks into the room and is surprised to find the President there, who explains, and this is near verbatim, "Oh, I was supposed to be at some <em>thing</em>, but some other thing ran over time so the first thing got cancelled."  And then Leo and Bartlett had the talk that was actually important to the episode's plot.  That, right there, is perhaps the clearest example of a scene's "pretense" as I can think of: everyone recognizes that the pretense is just that, an excuse to get the characters in some specific place to do a specific thing, but what that pretense is is totally immaterial once the "real" scene agenda starts moving.<br/><br/>So it makes me wonder if we should be looking more towards scene pretenses, and rolling with things from there, or perhaps distinguishing between establishing a scene agenda (which is then honored by the other players and actually serves as the scene's focus) and giving a scene pretense (which can be ignored almost as soon as it's explained away).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99094/#Comment_99094" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T18:37:35+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  6:37PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is one of those vague things about PTA that I suspect gets shifted (drifted? ecch, pthui, that word) around a lot, because I have seen some groups (shows?) hew very closely to the scene agenda and when that agenda is over, the scene is over, and others who, as you say, shift focus away from the agenda freely and without worry.<br/><br/>Thinking back, it was a matter of content.

Surely, the fistfights when you end up with a red card stalemate are mandatory?<br/><br/>Seriously though, I noticed that I find the game much more engaging when scene agendas and character issues overlap heavily during a conflict*. I've had games where the connection was a bit more vague and the episode - while fun - seemed to lack a little something. It felt a bit like a two-level game, where you had plot on one side and character drama on the other. <br/><br/>I think a pretense is a story band-aid or shortcut. You know that there's something fun waiting for you if only X would happen, so you sort of handwave it away to get there. Like you would handwave a chase sequence, if the whole point of the adventure's climax is to fight the villain. I prefer to use it very sparingly for pacing reasons or to get over a creative dead-end. But a well-phrased scene agenda can be a boon to focussing everybody's attention and creativity.<br/><br/>EDIT: * - I just realized, that I mixed up what I was trying to say there. I didn't mean that the conflict should be the same as the agenda, but that the conflict should serve as a sort of link between character issues and scene agenda. The smoother the connection the more exciting the scene becomes for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99235/#Comment_99235" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T11:12:51+00:00" title="September 26, 2007 11:12AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>That's funny.

Maybe it's just me, but making this more deliberate feels like potentially taking creative constraint just to the point of becoming limiting rather than encouraging. I'm not sure what benefit you'd get from precision.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of improv, where you get a situation: "Okay, Joshua, you're a disgruntled customer service employee at Wal-Mart, and Lenny, you're returning a defective vacuum. Go." Depending on how we play it, the scene might range from centering around whether or not you're going to give me the return, to revealing a budding sexual attraction between these two men, and anything else between. Part of the fun is in rolling with the contributions and seeing where we end up. The purpose of the situation isn't necessarily to tell us what to do, but where to start from.<br/><br/>Joshua, I'm curious - when you've encounted this in your games, how closely tied is it to people changing stances between author/actor? I tend to notice that when a player steps back from the character and goes, "The next scene has to move things forward - let's say it's a plot scene where we discover a useful clue from analyzing the meteor sample at my lab," agenda tends to stay consistent, more often than when they go, "I'm going to investigate the meteor sample in my lab and see if I find any clues. That's probably a plot scene." Maybe just because in the former, the player's intent is being communicated more clearly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99324/#Comment_99324" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T15:11:23+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  3:11PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2007 3:57PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * sigh *<br/><br/>Well, at least I'm apparently somehow <i>charming</i> when I do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99349/#Comment_99349" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T16:53:12+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  4:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Alex, I mean in terms of being more precise.

If Agenda is capitol A Agenda, but the pretense might be anything, as framed by the Producer (or even other players input, "Oh, um, I'm just in the room because some other meeting schedules got thrown, so I have free time".)<br/><br/>But I imagine that's not satisfactory, since we're talking about drift.  However, I'm not sure its a big deal either.  I've been in enough meetings to know that the meeting agenda isn't always what's followed.  If you're happy with the drift, and its getting results when it happens, then there's not really a problem that I see. If you're unhappy, then its the Producer's job to keep everything on the Agenda.<br/><br/>Since that entire last paragraph could put cut and pasted directly into an email and fired off to coworkers, I can assure you that keeping everything on the agenda fits <i>perfectly</i> with the Producer's role.<br/><br/>But I think the more aimless scene pretense is common to the "story" games of the 90's.  The Vampire elders have called a meeting, and go.  That certainly can work, especially with strong players, and you can still end up with great developments and capitol A Agenda. But, depending on the game, and PTA is one of them, an Agenda can be pretty much mandatory, if for no other reason than to have a goal for the times when the pretense isn't enough to bring about some story meat.<br/><br/>Agenda, of course, could always be a question, too, specifically to keep open a variety of potential directions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

set him up with a decent job?"<br/>"Can Sol cheer Bullock up?"<br/>"Can Sol convince Swearengen that he and Bullock aren't a threat?"<br/>"Is the Doc's fear of Swearengen and Dority stronger than his
