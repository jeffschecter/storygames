It is a learned skill to make up for games that either are being played for long term epic fantasy play when they are not meant to be or have put together poorly wrought mechanics where the terms for failure are poorly put together.<br/><br/>Shit, it was a skill I had, a skill I cultivated.  I am not coming out of left field, not knowing what this alien practice is about.  I used to fudge a ton and thought that any GM who didn't do so was foolish and setting themselves up for a big let-down because that is just it, all systems were a big let-down.<br/><br/>Now I am playing games where I can trust the dice to fall where they may.<br/><br/>The act of fudging and having to dance around the system took a tremendous amount of energy, energy that I have found is better spent doing other things.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/><br/>I bear a warning.

"Dancing around the system" is exactly what drove me into the arms of "indie"/"Forgie" games in the first place.<br/><br/>Deep down inside, I want to be a lazy GM. I want to make fun just happen without sweating for it. Fortunately for me, relaxing a bit and downsizing my workload really does make me a happier, more creative, better-contributing player. Having to continually paper over little pockets of Suck hiding in the rules is work, it gets in the way. I've tried letting up on the rules altogether and just BSing a lot, but that just made me a sloppy GM rather than a lazy GM -- not what I wanted at all!<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247721/#Comment_247721" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T02:41:28+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  2:41AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 2:41AM by Matthijs.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Thus the circle of life continues.

I think that Judd, on the other hand, is decrying the tire-spinning energy-wasting "All you need is a good GM; system doesn't matter" mindset that sets up what is the definitely asymmetrical and arguably dysfunctional at-the-table group dynamic where the GM is responsible for bringing the fun and the players show up to be entertained.<br/><br/>Now there's a real but potentially unresolvable debate here. I thought at first that you had to come to grips with the claim that you can't judge another person's game. But it may be enough to show that fudging the dice is consistent or inconsistent with a particular philosophy of play; then, depending on the extent to which you agreed or disagreed with that philosophy, you'd know whether or not fudging the dice was for you. On the other hand, if the at-the-table meaning (in the sense of its impact on play) of "fudging the dice" is fundamentally unknowable except within the confines of a specific instance of gaming (per my read of Jason's position), then maybe you do have to decide whether or not you can make judgments about other games before you can say anything about specific techniques.<br/><br/>To sum up: Jason is a radical relativist of actual play ("You don't know me!"), and Judd is...what?...an actual play egalitarian: he's against the Cult of the Great GM.<br/><br/>That's my take on it, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247736/#Comment_247736" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T05:58:05+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  5:58AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 6:45AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know Judd, I similarly don't have much of an interest in fudging die rolls or playing games where I feel forced to do so, but I didn't realize how much it stressed me out until you just mentioned that. I remember avoiding die rolls because I dreaded them. In some situations in games, there are just outcomes nobody at the table wants. One I can think of recently was where I killed a couple of characters in a 4th ed. game with a random trap that was just supposed to be a simple obstacle, not a PC-killer of doomdeath. It was a shit scene and it took the wind out of my sails for continuing the game at all. It made me wish I was running The Shadow of Yesterday which doesn't stress me out because I don't have to worry about crap like that happening.<br/><br/>I remember the days of bragging about making it through a game session without rolling a single die, and in addition to it being some "roleplaying, not ROLLplaying" mark of honor, it was also just a big relief.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247742/#Comment_247742" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T06:44:29+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  6:44AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Longer post trashed because I think the justifications of positions are what are making this all sound more like criticism than is intended.

Here is what I think a lot of the "all a game needs is a good GM" comes from.  In a system where fudging rolls might be necessary to keep the outcomes in the realm of what the table thinks is acceptable, a much greater burden is placed on the GM.  To come up with obstacles and challenges that are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAIR.</span>  Bret's example of a simple, obstacle trap taking out 2 players when it wasn't really designed to do that in 4th Ed is a good example of this.  And yes, it killed the game (I think I was in that one) for Bret.<br/><br/>How do we arrive at Fair?  Because 4th ed d20 is based on a d20 and huge swings of luck can happen, (unlike the more predictable 3d6 for Hero or GURPS), and by the sheer amount of traps, monsters, spells, abilities to draw upon, the "Good" GM is one who knows all of these things, can juggle *just* how tough to make each obstacle.  With 4th Ed, there are some guidelines that are far better than previous editions... but still, a trap that one team could waltz by (because of high thievery skills or magic rituals) another team could be stymied far beyond the "level" of the trap.  The "Good" GM knows the PC abilites and all the myriad moving parts of the system.  So, I think it is the GMs who can do this who get that label as "Good" and the myth perpetuates.  <br/><br/>But dang... is that boatloads of effort to become a "Good" gm.  And d20 is not the only system that really relies on a GM being at the top of their game, Exalted with all of its crazy combos, I found Weapons of the Gods a bit tough, because running bad guys, they were very, very different from one another and abilities really ran a gamut of options...when confronting the PC's gamut of options... things could get crazy really quickly.  Which is somewhat forgiveable in a genre like WotG... as it is over the top.  And I think I was a "Good" WotG GM, but man, I poured over the rules time and time again, kept reading the powers over and over.. and my prep was nuts... i wrote out power blurbs for each NPC so I could access those abilities at the table quickly and seamlessly w/o going to the book.  Judging whether I could put up some really tough powers versus my cast of PCs abilities and would it be a fun experience.  Now, I'm a real fan of wuxia stuff, but shit that was a lot of work.  <br/><br/>On the flip side, a FATE game like Spirit of the Century or Diaspora...oh, the PCs and NPCs can be so very, very varied in Aspects and Stunts and such... but the rules boil down to the same bonus .... tag an Aspect, get a +2 (or a re-roll).  One gets all the power of variation, without all the headache of different Feats, Abilities, whether a Shaman's power is Primal or Divine.<br/><br/>Now, I've played with Judd... this is a man who likes prep even less than I do.  So, I wouldn't recommend to him running d20...or just the other day he mentioned an interest in Warhammer RPG.  Dude, play in that... don't run it.  It doesn't play to your strengths and a lot to what you don't like about running.  <br/><br/>So in conclusion, to me, the Good GM is one who does a lot of work in their prep, knows the rules of a crunchy system really well and is good at balancing encounters and challenges.  And those who are willing to do that, great, those can be really fun games.  So the label isn't worthless, IMO, but it is not accurate in of itself.  The label should be the "Crafts(wo)man" GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247745/#Comment_247745" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T06:59:22+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  6:59AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Rob --<br/><br/>Can you elaborate?

The idea was that if the game was adversarial in nature (as D&amp;D often seemed to y young mind) then what was keeping the GM from cheating? And in this, I do not merely mean fudging die rolls, but also giving monsters more hit points, better abilities and generally screwing us coming and going.  <br/><br/>Over time, I saw some solutions to this come up, and one of the bigs one was removing the GM screen. The thinking was that so long as all the GM rolls were out in the open, he couldn't cheat, and there would be sunshine and rainbows for all.<br/><br/>Except, it doesn't work that way. The GM could be 100% straight with the dice and still totally screw the players. He still designed encounters, determined the number and positions of enemies, control the opinions of NPCs and controlled a thousand other subtle things that directed play.  Now, in time I got past this, and got to the point of realizing the GM and players were on the same side (and any chating that was goign on was probably pro-player), and all was well and good, but it never truly left my mind, and it comes up a lot in this context.<br/><br/>The GM has PLENTY of tools to keep his thumb on the scales, even if all rolls are out in the open*. Some of those tools are constrained in some games, but plenty still remain available, enough so that if the GM wants to fiat things, then he can.  I don't really need to get into the details of sleight of hand and confidence games to elaborate on how: it's doable.<br/><br/>So I feel like the objection to fudging ends up lacking substance. If there is a genuine problem with how or why the GM is tipping the scales, then it should absolutely be addressed, but simply removing one tool seems like equating the tool with the problem.

They can't interpret.  They can't react to the events at the table.  And sometimes, you look around the table and see that everyone is dragging or not engaging or whatever. Maybe that's the system at fault, but maybe everyone's been shopping for the holidays for two weeks straight.  You just threw down the dice and you see that the result means your players are gonna have to slog through another hour of play to get to their goal. You could go with the dice, then, or you could fudge, give the heroes their victory in the next five minutes and do a nice wrap-up scene before closing the game and not seeing each other for a few months while the holidays play out. Hitting the pause button for two+ months isn't going to work, not in the middle of things like this. You're not a dick. So you fudge the roll.  The bad guy messes up badly, and the players spring into terminal action, the heroes take the day, and you get some tired and grateful smiles around the table.<br/><br/>Nothing was broken about the system, there. Fudging was just the right move. Because you're the GM. YOU have intelligence.  YOU can interpret. YOU can react to events at the table.<br/><br/>So thinking about this, the crux I come to is here: You can view your dice a bureaucrat or as an oracle. The bureaucrat throws up his hands, proclaims those hands as tied, and sits there and lets the dice (the rules) tell him what happens every time.  The oracle sees those bones land on the table, nods sagely, and interprets the fuck out of them.  The same fall of those bones doesn't get the same interpretation every time, and that's a good thing. It's also fudging.<br/><br/> (broad generalizing brush here) If anything, I'd say what indie games have done is remove the option to be a bureaucrat regarding the rules/the cards/whatever, and say it's okay, even desired, even supported by the system explicitly to do nothing BUT fudge the results. Sure, that fudging is dressed up in more acceptable terms, but a lot of the actual mechanics on the table do nothing to constrain narrative flexibility.  (most) Indie games are simply unwilling to be rigid enough about the rules for interpreting randomization that "fudging despite the rules" even shows up as a possibility; instead it's "fudging *according to* the rules".<br/><br/>At this point I expect some folks to have the usual forum reaction and wave their hands around proclaiming that fudging means going against the rules, so my entire argument is moot.  If you're about to have that reaction, step back for a moment and pretend I used words that don't drive you crazy and look at my point: the narrative flexibility in these indie games is very similar to the narrative flexibility the GM occasionally imposes upon the traditional ones. I don't buy for a second that the latter is any worse -- or any better -- than the former. It's the same thing, just sitting in a different seat.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite>Because if the whole freakin' game is based on the actions of these fictional characters, and we've all agreed that success or failure those actions turn on the roll of the dice - blind, heartless, unyielding fate- then it sucks for the GM to just invent the results out of thin air when it<span style="text-decoration: underline;">matters the most</span>(ie - dramatic, possibly fatal moments).</blockquote>\nFudging (whether done in concert with the game rules or in opposition to them) is best when done to preserve the drama, not to steal from it, FWIW. I've seen drama get killed plenty of times by plenty of behaviors. If getting fucked by fate is what the players want, and they've communicated this to the GM, the GM shouldn't and won't fudge in the cases you're talking about.  If the players want their characters to have a hard goddamn time winning and fickle fate dictates an anticlimax with a lucky shot that takes down the hardest opposition in a single blow, maybe the GM should fudge things and make that opposition just a little harder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247765/#Comment_247765" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T08:20:56+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  8:20AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Fudging (whether done in concert with the game rules or in opposition to them) is best when done to preserve the drama, not to steal from it.</blockquote>\nBut if fudging is necessary to preserve the drama, then maybe the game system isn't right for the game you and the other players want (which is, I think, the main point that Judd and others have been making).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247767/#Comment_247767" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T08:23:53+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  8:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 8:24AM by komradebob.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>So thinking about this, the crux I come to is here: You can view your dice a bureaucrat or as an oracle.

Then as our skill levels even out, I will play more and more by the rules. Boardgames have no way of knowing how skilled we are. We need a human element to observe and adjust as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will also modify the game based on how much time we have to play. Let's play to 8 victory points instead of 10 since the movie starts in 2 hours. In D&amp;D; this might mean cutting down hit points to make combats faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we playtested D&amp;D; 4E, we thought it was the end of having to fudge die rolls for combat. A big sell was that there was an underpinning to the system that balanced encounter design. I don't know if this was true. I think it was. But it failed in my opinion. We've found encounter design in D&amp;D; 4E to be unreliable. A difficult encounter might be extremely easy (but often long and boring). While an easy encounter might lead to a total party kill. And with every new supplement that is released, the problem seems to exacerbate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't mind fudging. Especially if fudging means customizing our play experience to our specific group. The game can't make complex observations and adjust itself as needed. But I don't want to have to fudge to compensate for very basic game features. That's why I bought the game. Double so if those features were selling points.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own opinion, if fudging means customizing play experience to everyone's benefit, I'm ok with it. If fudging means making the basic game work consistently as advertised, then I think the game needs to go back to playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247774/#Comment_247774" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T08:37:21+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  8:37AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>So I feel like the objection to fudging ends up lacking substance.

I think for me (and Rob perhaps) the "fudge friendly" stance comes from the notion that you want to put spin on results, to nudge them occasionally, to fit the play experience folks are going for. I'd certainly see it as a problem if it was done constantly, when we're talking about fudging as something done in opposition to the rules of the game, but then I see problems in anything that's done so excessively that it becomes the dominant note.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247777/#Comment_247777" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T08:54:17+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  8:54AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, you know what - we probably fudge all the time and don't think about it.

These are not interchangeable approaches, though, because they fundamentally alter the nature of the game. You can play GURPS Special Ops with the dice as bureaucrats: at this point you're using them to simulate how your tactical choices pan out as realistic chances of success, and the "game" might be "outsmarting the GM" or "showing off my gun-porn know-how" or "reliving my time in the service". But using the same base rules, you could play GURPS Illuminati while treating the dice as oracles: the dice are interpreted with each roll and are read for degree of success strictly for flavour, as the "game" is for the players to invent crazy conspiracy theories and have engaging interactions with zany NPCs. You have to pick one approach and stick to it, lest you fundamentally change the game's assumptions mid-stream.<br/><br/>Most "indie" / story-games I've seen and played use dice as bureaucrats for mechanical reasons like pacing, but attempt to make dice themselves very flavourful to act as oracles for the subsequent freeform narration. As you say, there is considerable overlap between "fudging" and using the dice as oracles in terms of thought process and procedures used. Notably, and as a bit of an exception to the "typical" "story-game "formula" (scare quotes galore here), DRYH doesn't give the dice much power over the fiction. Instead it gives considerable leeway to the GM to set difficulties and interpret as s/he sees fit, something I initially saw as a weakness but have begun to understand is central to the game's success as a horror-themed story-centric game. Yet I don't think people see this as "fudging", because this lack of dispassionate clarity is a feature of the system and clearly documented therein.<br/><br/>My concern is with sitting down to play a game where the dice are clearly bureaucrats as inferred by very clear, procedural rules - let's say, a game like DnD 4E - and have them act as bureaucrats for 90% of the time and oracles for 10%, depending on the circumstances and results, by the ruling of any less than unanimous table agreement. Game rules ought to be reliable and predictable, even if the extent of the rules is simply "this game is unreliable and subject to the whims of the infallible GM, for the great benefit of all".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247790/#Comment_247790" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T09:27:44+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  9:27AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 9:50AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>the tire-spinning energy-wasting "All you need is a good GM; system doesn't matter" mindset that sets up what is the definitely asymmetrical and arguably dysfunctional at-the-table group dynamic where the GM is responsible for bringing the fun and the players show up to be entertained.</blockquote>\nYou know, I still think there's something fundamentally wrong with this concept: I don't think the situation is nearly as asymmetrical as it's made out to be, even if you accept the idea that "the GM is responsible for bringing the fun and the players show up to be entertained" is actually describing what happens.  (And I don't accept that, not really.)<br/><br/>If I set aside my godlike perspective on the game as a whole and just look at things from the perspective of a GM, what do I see?  I see me, the GM, directing a lot of things.  I'm making rulings on the actions of the PCs, I'm playing NPCs and assessing their motivations, I'm throwing plot hooks and complications around, and yes, I am standing up in the spotlight trying to entertain the <i>hell</i> out of everyone at the table.  I am even, on occasion, fudging dice to make things happen that will be more entertaining.  It is, no lie, a lot of work and effort being put into the game.  So why do I bother?<br/><br/>I bother because it's <i>fun</i>.  Because the more entertaining I am for the players, the more entertaining the players become for me.  I'm taking on a slightly increased workload for the game (only slightly, though), but the effort and attention I put into it is reflected and returned by the players when I'm doing it right.  If I am entertaining, they are engaged; if they are engaged, their play is awesome; if their play is awesome, I have an easier time being entertaining; etc., etc., until we're all having a great time.  That's the ideal, right there, and the asymmetry (slight as it is) actually contributes to the fun, because they are doing things that I can't do, and vice versa.<br/><br/><br/>If I look at it as a player, I don't see much difference.  I show up (presumably thinking "I am going to be entertained").  If the GM is trying to entertain me and doing a good job of it, then I get to loosen up and play my character to the hilt; I can try to have my character do all kinds of things within the game, and know that something fun and/or interesting will come out of that.  The more entertaining the game is, the more work I am doing as a player -- making plans, performing, etc. -- and since it's the fun kind of work, I don't mind doing more of it.  I put in more effort, the GM responds in kind, and we both keep pushing each other until the session is over.<br/><br/><br/>I don't know, maybe I resent the dismissive "the players show up to be entertained" statement because it ignores all the work that goes into playing a game, by making it sound like the GM stands up on the table and does a frantic dance while the players all loll back in their chairs, slack-jawed and drooling; seriously, if that's what's actually happening at someone's game night, the problem is clearly <i>not</i> that the game they're playing has a GM role (or if he's advised to fudge dice rolls or not).<br/><br/>What should be happening, and what I think does happen in the majority of games actually played with GMs, is that the GM and the players are entertaining <i>each other</i>, using different methods.  That's not bad design.  It's a different kind of fun than you get with a GM-less game, yes, but good lord, if there was one type of game that was perfect for everyone, we wouldn't need to keep making new games.  We'd just all run out and buy a copy of The Perfect Game and play that and nothing else, forever, the end.<br/><br/>edit to add: Thinking about this some more, it occurred to me that it's the players' efforts that tell me, as a GM, if I am "bringing the fun" or not.  If they loll back in their chairs and give me nothing, I am <i>not</i> being entertaining: I am being boring.  The more the players become a passive audience, the more I know that I am being a lousy, terrible GM and need to stop.  When I am being entertaining, the players make their characters do things, they keep pushing me, and they work their asses off; I have to scramble to keep up with them, and it's exhilarating.  I have so much fun as a GM when the players are doing that, and I don't think it's an accident that those are the games where I am told afterwards that I was an awesome GM who ran an entertaining game.  How much of that success is <i>my</i> effort?  It sure as hell isn't 75% or more, I can promise you that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247791/#Comment_247791" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T09:31:42+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  9:31AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's my issue with "fudging":<br/><br/>If we're playing a game, and you roll the dice, and then you don't like the result, for whatever reason, so you decide to say a different result happens, you just lied to me.<br/><br/>Hyperbole for effect: YOU FUCKING LIED TO ME! Yes! You did!<br/><br/>If the dice give you an un-fun result, why can't you just admit it? If you called for the roll, admit you made a mistake, or if it's written in the rules, admit the rules aren't doing what you want, and then everybody can agree to ignore that result.<br/><br/>When I sit down to play, I have two things: the rules written down and an expectation of play. If those two don't match up exactly, then I want the rules to change so they are better suited to producing the kind of play I expect. Of course! I don't want to play by the rules if they screw up the group's fun.<br/><br/>But the rule in Dragon Age is asking players (GM specifically) to lie. It's patronizing and insulting, and I don't want it in my games. You can just say "No, that die roll was wrong, how about we do this other thing instead, because it's closer to the experience we want from this game."<br/><br/>I mean, sure, if you have players who want the GM to entertain them, and don't mind some fudging if it produces dramatic effects, by all means, do what you have to do. But you can't use that technique with everybody -- use it on me and I'll be pissed. And frankly, I think honesty is a better policy, and that it can be written into the rules. Sure, people make mistakes and life goes on like Jason says, but gaming skills can be communicated, and when they are, they are learned and improved upon much easier. We can improve on 1981.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247792/#Comment_247792" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T09:37:56+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  9:37AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Several thoughts here.  This is all IMHO, of course.<br/><br/>First, isn't this kind of related to "say yes or roll the dice" (aka Make It A Gimme, in Robin Laws' terms)?  If I take dice in hand and consider rolling, knowing that one of the outcomes would totally suck for the game--then fuck it, I'm not going to roll.  I'm just going to pick the outcome I want, right?  So why is this roll in the mechanics in the first place?  If there are circumstances where it wouldn't suck, the rules need to outline those and tell me when to roll and when not to roll.  Leaving it up to individual GMs with only the vague guidance of "if it isn't fun" is bullshit design.<br/><br/>Second, related to this, there are many rules in RPGs that people put in because they think they're supposed to be there.  For example, a huge majority of RPGs feature character death as a result of random dice results in combat.  Why???  Because that's how it's always been done.  How many times is random character death fun, really?  Why not have the mechanics exclude character death in the first place?  Then you won't have to fudge.  Sure, some games work well with it--but honestly, more often than not, losing a character you've been playing just because the combat rules tell you to is completely unfun.  You lose all your investment in the character, which leads to less investment in future characters.  I've been there.  So!  If you're using GM Fiat because you haven't thought through your design, that's bullshit design.<br/><br/>Third, Vincent said once (I believe) that rules are there to bring about unwanted results.  Now, these aren't "unfun" results of the kind I've just talked about; they are results you wouldn't have picked if you were just freeforming, but they don't ruin your fun.  In fact, they lead to more fun by taking you out of your comfort zone or motivating you to do things you otherwise wouldn't.  If you allow and encourage fudging, you undermine the very reason you have RPG rules in the first place, because you end up where you were without rules: freeforming in your comfort zone.  So if you put Rule 0 into your game design casually and without much thought, chances are it's a bullshit design because it'll circumvent the whole reason you've got rules in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247793/#Comment_247793" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T09:37:58+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  9:37AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Yeah, I agree.  It is a learned skill to make up for games that either are being played for long term epic fantasy play when they are not meant to be or have put together poorly wrought mechanics where the terms for failure are poorly put together.</blockquote>\nNonsense. Everything else you say follows from this, and it is nonsense. It is not to your taste but it is not poorly put together and it doesn't make up for anything.<br/><br/>Let me try another way. I imagine Judd's Perfect Game. In this game there is never any need for the GM to adjust the outcome of the system because all outcomes are equally wonderful.  Judd's group marvels at the drama inherent in both success and failure, their hearts pound with love for every turn of every card, the GM has nothing to do with it, all they do is relax and enjoy the wonderful outcome of the perfect system.<br/><br/>Sure (from the gushing I've-flipped-through-it-and-the-art-looks-great reviews on the Internet) that I too will enjoy it, I purchase the same Perfect Game and present it, hands a-tremble, to my group, whereupon they declare it a disaster, the worst game ever invented, each and every outcome worse than the last, less interesting, boring, unfair, and of course I as the GM, following the rules, sit unresponsive to their disgust. Forty minutes into the session my wife stands and leaves without further word. The other players go too, except for my best friend who remains behind and shrugs, clearly willing to sacrifice his own fun if I were to continue, for the sake of our friendship he will put himself through the horrific misery of playing Judd's Perfect Game. Nobody ever speaks of it again. It is quietly eBayed through a false identity, just in case the buyer wants to come shoot me afterwards.<br/><br/>"Oh," but you say, "JDCorley, come now, no game could ever be created that would satisfy every group in every moment of play forever, that would be insane, your criticism is silly."  And thus you have conceded my point and I react only with unbearable smugness. <br/><br/>The group must, must, must, shall, will always, customize the output of the system for their own satisfaction in some way. Sometimes all players have this power, sometimes one player does. It is not a mistake to make it one player. In fact, if one player, as Rob D notes, has absolute control over vast swathes of content creation, it is not a mistake to give that player the power to fix system outputs that would otherwise invalidate other sorts of control the system also gives them. You may not like it, and that is fine, some people don't like country music and others love it, but it is not a mistake, it is not bad design, it should need no apologia.<br/><br/>In games where the GM-like figure doesn't have as broad a control over the game world (Primetime Adventures, With Great Power), then it stands to reason that less control over unsatisfactory system outcomes need be concentrated in their hands. And of course in games with no GM, that power is spread around to everyone.<br/><br/>As for player fudging, my experience has been that most of the time the player is fudging to increase their own satisfaction, the other players at the table know about it long before I do, and nobody cares, so in that situation, it's a satisfaction-positive practice, so I support it and would not see it as bad design in such a case to include text permitting it. <br/><br/>If someone else cares (for example, if the game has a PvP competitive element for them), then it's more serious.  And I suppose the same is true if they really want to see the GM/game world as an antagonist, then GM fudging might be more objectionable.  But in your typical fantasy RPG, as Rob notes, the GM is not really an antagonist or competitor. The power of the GM is just too great.  <br/><br/>However, this is not always true. D&amp;D4 and Fantasycraft both have "budgets" the GM must stay within when designing opposition. Those numbers should not be fudged, or if they are, it should be put into a house rule. (Even if it's just "hey, I didn't work out every 100 XP in this, I just eyeballed it, it might be a bit high or low, but there ya go".)  This is not bad design either, by the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247796/#Comment_247796" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T09:40:38+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  9:40AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>You can just say "No, that die roll was wrong, how about we do this other thing instead, because it's closer to the experience we want from this game."<br/></blockquote>\nIs there some reason you will accept this "in the moment" but not, say, preprinted in the game manual you have decided to use for play?<br/><br/>Seems an odd distinction to me, but all right...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247797/#Comment_247797" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T09:46:54+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  9:46AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've confirmed with Judd that my understanding of his position is correct:<br/><br/>Judd isn't looking for a game to give him what he thinks he wants.

My group has several such people.  "I trust you to do this and I'd rather you make a mistake than me have to step outside my character's viewpoint to make story evaluations and decisions, your mistakes hurt me less than staying with my character benefits me."<br/><br/>You're right that it's a preference, and as a matter of taste we can never argue them, but tastes go the other way too.

But even in the realm of laser-focused play-style games, I see a lot of room for improved text. If you write a game with absolute GM-authority, then you shouldn't pretend the dice are there for fair and random resolution mechanics -- you should just come right out and say that the dice, for the GM, are just suggestions for when he needs an idea. Do that, and I'll laud you for good game design.

I think the text that says that the dice are normally the arbiters but in certain circumstances they might not be are implying, and perhaps trying to train, people's preferences to be a bigger circle on the dartboard, easier to hit. If I play Dragon Age and follow the dice 99 percent of the time, it might be technically accurate that the dice are all just suggestions, but it seems unfruitful to call them that or for me to think of them like that all the time.  That's not to say your idea is wrong, just that I'm not sure it's the best way to describe things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247824/#Comment_247824" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T10:49:51+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 10:49AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>I've had experiences like this.<br/><br/>I wouldn't trade them for anything.<br/></blockquote>\nThen what amazes me is that you love them when a designer's horrific blunder creates them but not when your own, or another player's blunder creates them, it seems that the latter is far more likely to be productive, as an actual conversation can take place about it free of the poison of marketing and the acid of salesmanship, and whatever you might like about the first could be present in the second.

or another player's blunder creates them, it seems that the latter is far more likely to be productive</blockquote>\nYeah, that is sort of amazing.  Let's see if I can break it down a bit...<br/><br/>With all apologies to Bill, I'm going to lapse into metaphor.  It just feels like the most clear and comprehensive manner to convey what I'm on about here.<br/><br/>Say I just bought this new cookbook all about Mongolian food, and I invite some friends over for dinner because, dang, Mongolian food!  So I start cooking and I see that a recipe calls for goat.  Now I'm pretty sure I don't like goat and I'm pretty sure none of my friends like goat, and dang it's not like I know how to cook goat.  So I'll just replace goat with pork and hope for the best.  Maybe I tell my friends I'm using pork instead of goat, maybe I don't.<br/><br/>So we have dinner and then what?  Maybe we like it.  Does that mean we like Mongolian food?  Maybe we don't like it at all.  Does that mean we don't like Mongolian food?  Just what have we managed to accomplish?<br/><br/>To come back out of the metaphor, I feel like rpg forums everywhere are stuffed with the wreckage of this sort of thing.  And nothing good ever comes of it.  "Hey guys we tried playing PTA but we didn't really enjoy it.  No we didn't establish scenes like the rules told us to and we threw in some player-vs-player opposed checks.  So why does PTA suck so much?"  Or, occasionally, "Hey guys we played Shadowrun and it was totally awesome.  We tore out all the dice pools and replaced the hacking mechanics and got rid of the racist trolls, but dudes, everyone should be playing this game."<br/><br/>I think our basic difference of opinions over this is that I don't think having an enjoyable evening of gaming is the highest goal, in and of itself.  And I'm okay with that difference of opinions, for what that's worth.<br/><br/><br/>Now, it might be fair to say that I'm more generally arguing against Drift of all sorts here, which is probably true.  One might then point out that numerous games have explicitly authorized fudging in their rules, so what's the deal with being against Drift and against fudging simultaneously with those games?  I'm... I'm thinking that one over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247826/#Comment_247826" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T10:55:06+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 10:55AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>So we have dinner and then what?

Some games are constructed to produce uncomfortable results.  Sorcerer is one such game.  When I first started playing it the game would get into a situation where it felt like I must be doing something wrong because there wasn't anyway to "escape" from the uncomfortable result.  I talked to Ron about it and discovered that was by design.  It's designed to "trap" players into making tough choices, live with the consequences and not be able to "wriggle" out of things.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>A character and his demon are searching a room.  When the GM announces that someone is coming through the door.  The player decides to hide.<br/><br/>Here's the thing.  The GM controls the demon.  If I announce ANY other action for the demon OTHER than hiding it, by the rules, becomes impossible for the the player to get both his character and the demon to hide.  It's impossible.  Can't happen.  Period.  The player has to prioritize: Hide himself and let the demon be discovered?  Stop the demon from whatever it's doing but get found out?  Help the demon?  Help who ever is coming through the door consequences be damned?  etc.<br/><br/>The first time I encountered this situation it was very uncomfortable.  I thought I must be doing something wrong.  The player wants he and his demon to hide, there must be SOME way to roll or whatever to get that happen.  Nope.  Turns out not.  Now, if I'd simply fudged the rules or otherwise jigged the results here's what happens in the long run.<br/><br/>1) I never learn to leverage that "trapping" feature of the rules to maximum effect.  I have since learned how to declare actions for NPCs that really put PCs in a bind and they have produced some of the most nail bitingly intense moments in all of my role-playing history.<br/><br/>2) If it turns out that I personally don't like or want this "trapping" feature in my gaming because I don't like (too tense, too uncomfortable, whatever) then I'm going to be fudging these results A LOT.  I'm going to be constantly, constantly fighting against one of the very things the system is designed to do.  That's in and unto itself a kind of uncomfortableness and stress I don't want.<br/><br/>It's better to recognize: What are the components of this game designed to help me do?  Do I want to do that?  Yes?  Great.  Learn it.  Master it.  Work within the design and grow from it.  No?  Great.  Leave by the way side.  Find something you do want to learn and master and grow with.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247835/#Comment_247835" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T11:14:14+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 11:14AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, sorry, Jason, miscommunication there.

That's not my experience at all.<br/><br/>Rather, consider this viewpoint: games provide methodical tools for structuring your activity in such a manner as to make it more enjoyable by whatever metric you care to choose. A good game provides a solid methodology that is easy to use, reliable and does what it purports to do. A bad game provides a set of instructions that sucks in some manner.<br/><br/>Now, this is pertinent for the discussion here because I totally agree with whoever first said that games with fudging suck ass. I just don't think that they suck because they give me the wrong results out of random dicing. Rather, the suckage is in the fact that the procedure of fudging is not fun: in a dramatically creative game, say, it requires me to make uncouched, pure dramatic calls with nothing to go by except my own aesthetic preferences. That's quite some pressure, and clear breakpoint from normal play wherein I can actually just follow a well-crafted set of procedural instructions without having to suddenly become Shakespeare in the middle of the scene. In fact, it requires me to play like I were freeforming - and if I liked doing that, that would be what I would be doing, obviously enough.<br/><br/>Also, claiming that all games require fudging is bullshit, at least if we understand fudging to mean stepping outside the defined procedures to arrive at material results. There are plenty of games that have complete decision-making spaces wherein all valid choices made by all participants are accounted for as methodological options. For example, I did put some considerable effort in writing the newest iteration of the Solar System rules in such a manner as to account for, name and regulate all decisions any player of the game might need to do to achieve the goals of the game - and that's a game with a rather traditional set-up and wide, wide leeway in the content of the game and the various situations it handles; simpler and tighter games are even easier to write to make fudging unnecessary. I'm pretty certain at this point that if you find yourself fudging the results in a game designed for non-fudging like Solar System, you're doing something wrong - either you don't accept valid results of the game procedures, or you failed at some intervening set-up, or you're misapplying the procedures to arrive at unacceptable results that require fudging.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247841/#Comment_247841" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T11:47:20+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 11:47AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, just wanted to say: I see a lot of exploring in the area which is often the "excluded middle" in these kinds of discussions (All Fudging is Bad----Fudging is Just Another Tool, and Good) here in this thread, and I'm liking that.<br/><br/>There's a lot of things here that are being labelled as Fudging, when they're probably different things. However, since we don't break our language down that far (or speak German, where I bet there's a term for it which incidentally includes a word for sausage) we'll just have to deal.<br/><br/>So, in lieu of a solid piece of prose, I'm here to shotgun some quick thoughts based on things said in this thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Amber DRPG is a great lesson in the ups and downs of GM Fiat</blockquote>\nProbably so. I think a diceless system (unfortunately there are so very few) would be a great experience to see the complexities of GMing where all interpretation is up to one person. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>So I feel like the objection to fudging ends up lacking substance. If there is a genuine problem with how or why the GM is tipping the scales, then it should absolutely be addressed, but simply removing one tool seems like equating the tool with the problem</blockquote>\nThere's a sub-discussion in here as well, basically one which Judd acknowledges as well. "Fudging as the GM completely discarding results, repeatedly, to keep the story on track", vs "Fudging (actually, maybe this should be called "<b>Nudging</b>"?) as the GM adjusting NPCs, background difficulties and the like to make up for rare and totally unforseen circumstances" ("Oh, I forgot that this NPC has one ability that will totally kill any player, because they can't defend against this. Oops, total oversignt on my part when I built this NPC. I'll lower the damage from 10 to 2 and play up the other abilities instead"). <br/>One depicts that GM as disregarding anything that gets in the way of his story. The other depicts the GM as leveraging a tool to correct for an oversight he made.<br/><br/>Personally, I think it's a tool to be leveraged. But working in computers, my metaphor for it is like issuing a Reboot: When you do it, it's good to make sure that the reboot is needed, that it's the only way to solve the problem, and take notes to make sure you can fix the problem next time without a reboot.<br/>When you're issuing reboots at the first sign of trouble (especially on non-Win systems), then A) You have a persistent problem, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> You suck as an engineer.<br/>I think this metaphor holds true for GMing as well.<br/>And... it is the same with other tools in the toolbox. I saw a GM totally overuse the "Fishing/Mountain Witch Trick" to drive an adventure where he had zero ideas of what to do next. He used it like 12 times in a 3 hour game, it was really transparent and kinda off-putting (like, "c'mon, can't you come up with SOMETHING for yourself?"). Just like that, I've been in games where the GM used fudging to that extent as well, but honestly it's been like 1993 since I was in a game THAT bad. Still, just like any other tool, like Story Games (tm) tricks, they are tools which can be functional in some places, totally overbearing and useless in others.<br/><br/>(more in a sec).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247844/#Comment_247844" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T11:55:12+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 11:55AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a very big and contentious issue.<br/><br/>Fudging ties in with Illusionism, as one oft-used technique of the playstyle.<br/>Fudging ties in with Rule 0, as the most common critique of this rule is its granting of a license to fudge at all times.<br/>Fudging as defined by Fred Hicks (bureaucrat vs oracle) ties in with all aspects of GNS.<br/>Fudging can be done by both GM and players, can be done in the open or in secret, and this makes a world of difference to most.<br/>In particular, fudging as a concept has a relationship with a number of major RPG Religions, either as the Saviour or as the Adversary.<br/>Fudging means many different things to many different people.<br/><br/>Because of this it is, as Rob D noted, difficult to discuss without poking at people's nerves.<br/><br/>Fudging may be less prevalent in story games simply because of the critique leveled against it by <a href="http://independentinsurgency.com/index.php?post_id=473352" rel="nofollow">die-hard anti-story-games fanatics</a>. Ofttimes it seems that play occurs on two distinct planes; the mechanics, character sheets, dice rolls ("boxes") and the narrative content ("clouds"). In many games boxes and clouds are completely intertwined - statistics in boxes mean something definitive in the fiction, and vice versa. In "Don't Rest Your Head" or the much-reviled "HeroQuest 2" this is not true - a challenge technically unchanged in the clouds may have a different "Challenge Rating" in the boxes depending on the needs of the story.<br/><br/>DRYH is actually an excellent example because of its, purposeful I'm sure, avoidance of describing outcomes in boxes as definitive outcomes in clouds. Would you ever fudge a roll such that Madness didn't dominate, if that meant that the last point of Discipline would be lost and the PC would become a Nightmare? I'm purposely picking this example because it's the only rule I can think of which mean something <i>definitive</i> in the fiction. Even collapsing from exhaustion does not, by the rules, <i>have</i> to mean that you are eaten by the Nightmares - only that, if it seems appropriate, that's a likely outcome.

Backing out of it afterward I think would kill the meaning of the choice that the players make whenever they pick up the madness dice or choose to add exhaustion. The tension of long term risk vs getting that you want now in the fiction is what makes a DRYH game in my opinion. Granted I could maybe see re-doing the roll if the player did not know that losing his last discipline die was a possibility and it was a mistake and all. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247852/#Comment_247852" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T12:21:58+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 12:21PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there ever a reason to fudge anything in Don't Rest Your Head?<br/>Is there ever a reason to fudge anything in DnD 4E?<br/><br/>Both are luck-and-resource management games with bolted-on narration, the main difference being that DnD 4E puts dice before narrative (=narrative used as needed) and DRYH puts narrative before dice (=dice used as needed).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247853/#Comment_247853" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T12:22:15+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 12:22PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot going on in this thread, wow.

Thanks for that metaphor, Fred.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>So:  Anyone on the "GM fudging rolls is okay" side of the fence want to take up the "Players fudging rolls is okay" banner?  If not, why not?</blockquote>\nThis might be a discussion for another thread, but I see this all the time in hippie games, especially ones where you get more dice or bonuses for bringing things into the game. Happens ALL THE TIME in Dogs in the Vineyard, for instance.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>Andy: I am going to bring my "I am a Dog for the Lord of Life" and "Knows the scripture back and forth" into my roll. That's 2d10 and 3d6.<br/>GM: [Rolls a shitload of dice]<br/>Andy: Fuck, no way I can beat that. **<br/>Johnny Shitpants (another player): Oh, hey, why don't you bring in your Coat into the conflict? That will give you 2d8 more you can use! ****<br/>Andy: Oh, good point. Yeah, I (adds bit about my coat, takes the dice)<br/>Andy: Hmmm.... Still not enough. Crap, I really wanted to win this one, too. Oh well, I guess I'll...<br/>GM: Actually, Andy, I can totally see you also bringing your relationship with the Steward into this conflict. Evoke him, or just drag him along, that's totally in line with what is happening here. ****<br/>Johnny Shitpants [nods in agreement] Totally! That would be cool!<br/>Andy: OK, I'll do that. <br/>Andy: YAY, I WIN.<br/><br/>In the above example,<br/>** ---&gt; This is basically when the player "rolled his dice and read the result". A loss. Too bad. Then the "fudging" begins:<br/>**** ---&gt; Now, mind you, a DITV conflict is a back-and-forth of bringing stuff into the fight, but I've seen this effect in every single game I've played or run, and I suspect other people have too: After the back and forth is "pretty much over", and the player realizes the odds are stacked against them, and the other PLAYERS recognize that this conflict is important to the character, they (and even the GM!) will suggest to the player more things they can do to bring more dice into the conflict. Basically, they player's "roll" is over, and they see the Result, and yet the other players push them forward to bring in more into the conflict, even stretching the narration thin a bit, in order to bring more dice in and win.<br/><br/>I submit that what happens in "****" is, on the player's side, exactly the same situation as what happens when a GM nudges/fudges dice. The roll was cast, the result accepted by the rolling player; and then players (and the GM) pushed for a loss to turn into a win above and beyond the "back and forth narration/conflict rules": Admittedly other players help out in that nudging/fudging, but it's there.<br/><br/>It's the same as if the GM rolled the dice in the open, made a mistake and accidentally framed up a conflict where losing meant "the game ends", and then the players see that result and suggest ways that the loss wasn't as bad, or that the game could continue, or where it should actually be a win but with some kind of setback, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247854/#Comment_247854" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T12:23:17+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 12:23PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 12:27PM by C_Edwards.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So is this just an issue of expectations then?

Hell, I have done the save vs. Death roll and then fudged the difficulty of the roll so that the player succeeded instead of failed on the roll that was out in the open. And each time it just seemed\u2026 well cheap or lame to me. I have much more enjoyed the games in which failure on the roll results in something interesting, something that continues the story or brings it to the end. <br/><br/>Now I have games that work much better for me in the way they handle un-fun failure and I definitely prefer my games to provide and support play in which failure is as interesting as successes. One of the common denominators I see in these games is in the way the failure conditions are reached. Stuff like BW in which the consequences of failure are decided before the dice are rolled, like Dogs and SotC where you can give on the conflict or like Sorcerer and TSOY where each intent is decided on and revised until the table reaches an agreement then dice are rolled. Sure if the end conditions are just not working for the game after the dice rolled, then we can discuss and nudge the game back on track. Mistakes happen. Which I suppose is still fudging. I guess it just feels more organic and supported when it occurs in a game where you are already discussing and working this stuff out already, instead of that oh fuck moment when you realize the fickleness of the dice just killed the fun in the room so you chose of ignore the roll instead. I never want to have to make that call as a GM again. <br/><br/>Sorry for the ramblings as I sort my brain out on this <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247895/#Comment_247895" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T15:29:33+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  3:29PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 3:30PM by blankshield.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fudging the roll is a symptom of the root issue, which is:<br/><br/>If this application of fortune does not give a particular result, the game will not proceed [at all/in the direction I want/to a satisfying conclusion before midnight/insert other personal or group motivation here].<br/><br/>As more than a couple folks have pointed out, this sucks.

Cheating ruins that fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\n- All games operate by consensus.  If everyone is happy, it does not matter that the GM is cheating.  The group has specific payouts that are being met.  And they don't have any turnoffs being agitated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact one might say that cheaters and honest folk have different creative agendas.  One wants the kindly GM to tell them a story, the other wants to play this cool game.

I mean, I think fudging is really just a subset of players using power, apportioned to them via the rules or social contract, to arbitrarily make judgment calls about stuff.  The controversy over fudging is really about when/which players should and shouldn't make what kinds of arbitrary judgment calls, yeah?

Usually these fundamental orientations are hidden, which is probably a good thing, since it means we don't have to confront them in play--most of the time. At other times, it can come as big shock, from either direction.<br/><br/>(1) "What!? You mean you LIED to me about what the dice said? Now my victory is meaningless!"<br/>(2) "What!? You mean you SAT THERE and let the dice kill me in this sucky way? Now my death is meaningless!"<br/><br/>I say that talking about this gets at fundamental orientations because you can hear in people's reasons for coming down one way or another a vision of the play experience they're trying to preserve. <br/><br/>In Judd's case -- call it the Karlman Diet; i.e., "No fudge for you" -- I hear a kind of striving for maximal player autonomy. We have a set of procedures that we go to when they're called for, and we want to know that we can rely on them so that we can drive for story, advocate for our characters, and in general <i>play hard</i> without having to worry that social- or table-level factors will insert themselves between us and the fiction. I think Eero comes down here too: You only need to fudge when shit is <i>broken</i>.<br/><br/>In Rob and Fred's case -- call it the Hicks-Donoghue Menu; i.e., "Try a little fudge; you might like it" -- I hear a more communal or collectivist aspiration. Play is a social experience, and the GM's role is to facilitate that experience by stage managing it if necessary. I think AFT gets here, too, with his vision of the GM and players in a relationship of reciprocal and mutually sustaining entertainment of each other.<br/><br/>I think that Jason is at an extreme that I want to call Corley's Candified Cosmology, i.e., "It's all fudge, all the way down." In his view, the unique configuration that is the interaction of the play group with the game text cannot reliably be classified, so that a procedure that means one thing in one group can mean something radically different in another group. You can't talk about an experience of play, in other words, without knowing about its context.<br/><br/>Of course, there's a lot of slippage with respect to what people mean when they say "fudging"; some take it as encompassing the entire repertoire of in-play GM fiat and pre-play prep that has to take place. I'd prefer a much much narrower definition, like say "when the die or other randomizer says X and you pretend it says Y."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247917/#Comment_247917" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T17:35:16+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  5:35PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, that is damn fine summation and I like your defination of "fudging"... prob cause it matchs the way I use the word <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I would consider myself on the Karlman No Fudge Diet, but hey I am weak and sometimes I cave and order off of the Menu.

Maybe it's a problem with the game system, maybe it's just a problem with you, but it is definitely a problem either way.<br/><br/>But assuming that you are as imperfect as every other living creature on this or any other world, at some point you're going to screw up.  You'll put an outcome up to a die roll when you shouldn't have, and realize only too late that you shouldn't have done that.  You will feel that sticking to the letter of the rules will be less fun, less productive, and less correct for you and everyone at the table than it would be to give the rules a little nudge to make things take a different course.  And as has been mentioned already in this thread, you may even find that there is a particular subsystem that you are constantly having to fudge, and now you've learned that you should probably drift the system or switch to a different game entirely (fudging in this case is a sign that you need to re-evaluate something).<br/><br/>I have no complaints about a game text specifically saying "if something doesn't come out right, go ahead and fudge it," any more than I would with rule-zero text or what have you.  I do sort of wish that they made it clearer that you should <i>think carefully</i> about fudging or rule-zeroing things before doing it, and devoted a little time to discussing the whys and hows behind the rules so that you could better understand what you might be changing and/or ignoring to suit your own preferences, but that's apparently a lot to ask of a game developer.  On the whole I'm happy that they at least acknowledge that the rules as written are inevitably going to have to be tweaked, stretched, or adjusted to fit the actual situation at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247930/#Comment_247930" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T19:13:31+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  7:13PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite> in general<i>play hard</i>without having to worry that social- or table-level factors will insert themselves between us and the fiction.</blockquote>\nThis.<br/><br/>Right Here.<br/><br/>This is most important to me.<br/><br/>As a GM, I'm not here to "protect" or "service" or "deliver" your fun.

He don't only because they are good for the show.<br/><br/>And the players... they know what they are playing? They know that it's only a show? And if they don't... how would they react when they will discover it?<br/><br/>I can't answer these question for other people. But for me, being the "entertainer" sucked, year after year, every drop of fun from role-playing. At the end I was doing it only to avoid disappointing my friends. But at the same time, I blamed my friends for "making me do it", not a good way to play, at all.<br/><br/>Discovering that I did not need to be an entertainer, that there are a lot of game system where you are a player who play with other people, even if you are the GM, was what made me return to the hobby, and improve my play 1000%<br/><br/>In my experience, it's a one-way road. I know a lot of people who stopped fudging rolls when they discovered games with rules that work without fudging. I know no one who began to fudge roll after playing with rules that work. Ever. But your experience may be different.<br/><br/>P.S.: I see people in this - and other - thread using some very strange definition of "fudging rolls". I think it's only a way of muddying the waters.

If they keep trying different things with the system, eventually they'll hit the wall: there is no rule system for a roleplaying game that can adequately cover every situation for every gaming group.  It is an impossible standard to ask of any game designer.  By all means, game designers should strive for that ideal -- they just shouldn't be upset or feel like failures when they inevitably fall short.<br/><br/>Now, what people do when they hit that wall where the rules stop working is a different matter.  I actually have no problems if some people want to say, "Fuck it, we're sticking with the rules to the letter no matter what," as long as they know why they're choosing that option.  If other groups say, "Okay, we've gotta change this," that's fine, too.  Because honestly, they're the ones at the table playing the game, they're the ones who have the best chance of finding the solution that works for them.  The game designer can't do that for them.  Internet outrage can't do that for them.  The decision is entirely theirs.<br/><br/>I do think it would be nice if a game text addressed that more directly and gave useful advice on how to make that decision, but I'm not holding my breath waiting for it to happen.  I think we're going to be stuck working out answers to these problems entirely on our own for a very, very long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247958/#Comment_247958" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T22:16:21+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 10:16PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should note that all games fail when applied to my group, forever, so no matter your experience in your group, my experience in my group disproves the notion that there are some rulesets which in every group produce felicitous outcomes for all possible actions.

You trust me about this, right? If you don't, why don't you?</blockquote>\nBecause you don't alter how you play to conform to the expectations of individual games.  From what I've seen you post you just decide what you want to do with the game and make it do that rather than learning and growing and changing to MASTER the game from within its design assumptions.<br/><br/>How I run Sorcerer?  Not how I run My Life with Master.  How I run Dogs in the Vineyard?  Not how I run One Can Have Her.  How I run Primetime Adventures?  Not how I run Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>I try (don't always succeed) to approach each of these games like I've never heard of an RPG before and see what it demands of me.  Just like when I buy a board game I read the rules and ask: What do I need to do become good at *this* game.  Because being a master Chess player is completely different from being a master Poker player is completely different being a master Dominion player.<br/><br/>Sure there are some general "gamesmanship" skills that apply across board but playing and studying chess for 10 years ain't going to make you win any poker tournaments. <br/><br/>That's how I approach RPGs and I have yet to see anything you've posted indicate that you put in similar effort and focus.  If you do then I apologize but I haven't seen it in anything you've ever posted.  Everything has always been about how you alter or gut a game to suit your own purposes, which is fine, but it's not how I like or why I play games.<br/><br/>I've never encountered a problem with a situation in Sorcerer because every time I've encountered any kind of hitch I've considered it carefully.  Asked myself the question: how does the design philosophy of this game enable me to solve this problem?  I have never failed to find a solution from within the game when I approach the game on its own philosophical terms.<br/><br/>Same with My Life with Master.<br/><br/>Same with Primetime Adventures.<br/><br/>Etc.  Etc.<br/><br/>Are there things I don't like about these games?  Yes.  Sometimes that's an uncomfortableness that is intentional and is supposed to stretch the creative legs of the play group.  Sometimes it's just a feature I don't like or don't handle well.  But I still have always found a way to handle it *within* the context of the game even if I don't find it particularly satisfying.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247967/#Comment_247967" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T22:45:24+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 10:45PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh? <br/><br/>So if I need a 19 to-hit in a d20 game, roll a 19, decide that hitting would be lame narratively, and instead of adjusting the die roll, adjust the NPC stats on the page, that is not fudging? That is merely following the rules?<br/><br/>So if I think it would be cool for this guy to throw an electricity ball in a Unisystem game, but there is no power for "electricity ball", so I just use a "fire ball" power description and call it an "electricity ball", that is not fudging? That is following the rules?<br/><br/>So if I think, "ugh, this town is dragging on and on and look at that asshole player there smug as shit, he's not even listening, I'm going to wrap this up fast and move on" in a Dogs in the Vineyard and I manipulate not the dice on the table but the numbers on my notes, everyone at the table is relieved, relaxed, even the smug guy is happier, I haven't fudged? That is following the rules?<br/><br/>Is this only about changing a number on the dice? I thought it was about something much more than that. Because virtually no GM fudging is about ignoring a die roll, but as Rob D notes, manipulating the numbers around the roll. They're more opaque and easier to control.  Seriously, if all this is about is when to look at the dice, it would be better for everyone to wave their hand dismissively and laugh a haughty laugh. Let the servants clean up that question, we have more significant things to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247968/#Comment_247968" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T22:47:54+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 10:47PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 10:50PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I try (don't always succeed) to approach each of these games like I've never heard of an RPG before and see what it demands of me.</blockquote>\nThe hell? What does this have to do with fudging or not fudging to increase your enjoyment? Of course you have to understand the game, otherwise how do you know when to deviate from its results? It doesn't sound like you're searching for mastery at all, in the sense of knowing how to use what you've got to maximize your satisfaction. It sounds like you're nestling, secure and protected by someone else's judgment (the designer?) that you can foist off responsibility on when things go badly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11153/continued-from-dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review-gm-fiat-and-fudging" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11153/continued-from-dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review-gm-fiat-and-fudging" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11153/continued-from-dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review-gm-fiat-and-fudging/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11153/continued-from-dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review-gm-fiat-and-fudging/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11153/continued-from-dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review-gm-fiat-and-fudging/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11153%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11153%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>continued from [Dragon Age TTRPG] a brief review: GM Fiat and Fudging - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11153/continued-from-dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review-gm-fiat-and-fudging/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="continued from [Dragon Age TTRPG] a brief review: GM Fiat and Fudging - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11153/continued-from-dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review-gm-fiat-and-fudging/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Yes, JD, it is solely about ignoring the result of an already rolled die result.

It's only possible to get to those points with *every* game if you play in bad faith, or more charitably if you go outside the scope of what the game is intended to do, i.e. try to get PTA to do detailed tactical skirmish combat.  But just because your car doesn't fly doesn't mean it's not a great car.  If you need to fly somewhere, take a plane.  (I suspect this point I've outline is one side of another dichotomous spectrum in which there are basically two camps.  I say, "the game does work fine, so long as you stick within its boundaries," you say, "Aha! So you admit there are places where the game breaks!")<br/><br/>And when I play RPGs, do I stick to what the designer intended?  Hell yes.  Remember that oftentimes the rules texts give participants broad input into the fiction (this is what Iago correctly pointed out, but it has nothing to do with flat-out ignoring rules).<br/><br/>Asking whether every scene of every Dogs game I've played is equally dramatic and wonderful is a bit of a red herring.  Of course not.  The question is, could I have improved lagging Dogs games by simply ignoring the rules about how the dice work?  I don't think I could have.<br/><br/>I also think the "Judd's Perfect Game" thing upthread was badly misinterpreted.  The idea that a particular game should work for all possible groups of players is ludicrous.  There are certain techniques that some gamers just haven't mastered and never will.  Again to return to my vehicle analogy: you may have to have a driver's license to operate the thing; doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247972/#Comment_247972" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T22:52:31+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 10:52PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 10:53PM by droog.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD:<br/><br/>1.

they've found a game with rules that work without fudging just haven't found the point at which those rules stop working yet.  If they keep trying different things with the system, eventually they'll hit the wall: there is no rule system for a roleplaying game that can adequately cover every situation for every gaming group.</blockquote>\nOh, yes, I believe that you think this, but I know better.<br/><br/>Every single game I play, these days, work without any fudging. At at all. No matter if I play it with my usual group, with friends from afar, or as a demo in a convention. There is never any time where I need to fudge rolls to make them work.<br/><br/>Oh, I know that there are scores of people who say that these games are "all fudging". Because they are not able, mentally, to see the difference between a game system and a so-called "model of reality" build from tables and dice. So when a game system say to the GM to assign, for example, NPC stats on the fly, they are not able to see the difference between following a rule and cheating.  It's like someone caught with an ace in his sleeve playing poker, that try to defend saying "well, everybody cheat at Poker! When you decide to bluff or not, you are thinking for yourself, so that is cheating, exactly as having an ace in my sleeve". I see this sort of strange rule-blindness every time this topic is argued in any forum. It's so simple a concept: cheating. But some people really can't seem to see the difference from following the rules. <br/><br/>I think that is a matter of self-preservation, of self-image.  For years (too many years) the "best" GM was the one who was better at cheating. Some people was bad at this, and only ruined the game for everybody. Some people, like me, was good at this, but did not like it, and ruined the game for himself. These people see games with rules that work as a liberation, as a way to being free, at last, to play with my friends instead of playing my friends. <br/><br/>But the people who was good at cheating, and was not bothered by it... the one ones who were PROUD of that, that still, after all this time, thing that they "saved" the games, that the other players would have "ruined" the game without them having "saved" them with their cheating...  they see all this talking of better games, of games that work without all the skill they have learned, the skills that, in their mind, MAKE THEM GOOD GM, and they react. It's live every single GM who tell his personal experience, of being finally free to play as a player between player, is a personal insult or a menace (and, for some of them, they were: I personally know some GM who lost their entire group when their players discovered games that worked without fudging and they refused to stop "improving" the game by cheating...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>It is an impossible standard to ask of any game designer.</blockquote>\nReally? A game that work without fudging is an "impossible standard"?<br/><br/>I think that, if one is not able to do a game that work without fudging, how can call himself a game designer? It would be more honest call himself a setting designer...<br/><br/>For me now is the bottom line: to be at least considered for play, a game MUST be playable, must work. But it's really no problem, there are so many games now that play without any fudging, that I could never buy them all.  The  games I play do much, much more than simply "work"<br/><br/>For all the rest, Jesse already said it.<br/><br/>P.S.: I didn't want to name games in the post because it's a very general comment. The games that work are really a lot, and it would have been not right to name only a few. But if you want some example (and they are only this, examples) these are some titles: Trollbabe (the new version), Spione, Dogs in the Vineyard, and even good old The Pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247987/#Comment_247987" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T23:26:49+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 11:26PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>But just because your car doesn't fly doesn't mean it's not a great car.</blockquote>\nAnd just because some people want to take the car into the garage and make that son of a bitch fly like cars are supposed to in the 21st century doesn't mean that they are making the car worse.  Or that they don't know what a car is.  Or that they don't like cars.  Or that they don't understand how a car is supposed to work.<br/><br/>I think we're getting distracted by a philosophical difference, between people who want to tinker and people who don't: this has little (if anything) to do with fudging in any of its various definitions, and is also not something that can really be argued.  Some, like JDCorley, want to push the limits of what a game can do and use anything and everything he's ever learned from every game he's ever played to make his gaming sessions as good as they can be:  others, like yourself, want to stay firmly within the prescribed limits of the game they are playing and use nothing beyond that.  One side is not more right than the other, or more pure, or more commendable.  They are just different ways of approaching games.<br/><br/><br/>For me, with RPGs, I'm more in line with JDCorley: I like tinkering with the game and using everything in my bag of tricks.  I want everyone at the table to be responsible with me for making our session not suck: if that means changing the rules, awesome, we're changing 'em.  If it still sucks, we'll try something else until we find the combination that stops sucking.<br/><br/>But with boardgames, I'm more like you: I want to play it strictly by the rules, and if the game sucks as a result, well, at least we tried to play it "the right way" and now we know that it's because the game sucks and not because we suck.  I'm not going to tinker with a boardgame -- that's not fun for me (or at least not as fun as tinkering with RPGs), so I'm not even going to waste my time doing it.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure why I make this distinction in my head, but I do.  To me, RPGs have <i>always</i> been open for different rules interpretations, house rules, etc.; but boardgames have hardly ever been (I still get a little frown at the thought of people collecting money on "free parking" in Monopoly, for example).  Maybe that's my high school AD&amp;D experience, since that was a system that was so fucking miserable to play that house rules were practically required.  Maybe if I'd been brought up on a strict diet of better RPGs, I wouldn't feel the need to evaluate them on my own terms rather than within whatever boundaries the designers established.

It is a learned skill to make up for games that either are being played for long term epic fantasy play when they are not meant to be or have put together poorly wrought mechanics where the terms for failure are poorly put together.<br/><br/>Shit, it was a skill I had, a skill I cultivated.  I am not coming out of left field, not knowing what this alien practice is about.  I used to fudge a ton and thought that any GM who didn't do so was foolish and setting themselves up for a big let-down because that is just it, all systems were a big let-down.<br/><br/>Now I am playing games where I can trust the dice to fall where they may.<br/><br/>The act of fudging and having to dance around the system took a tremendous amount of energy, energy that I have found is better spent doing other things.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/><br/>I bear a warning.

That JDCorley would find the discussion uninteresting because Judd defines fudging as changing values on dice while JD's technique relies on modifying underlying stats compared with the dice rolls is incomprehensible to me; that's just two sides of the same coin.<br/><br/>I think there's also a bit of misunderstanding regarding JDCorley's playstyle. <b>From what I have gathered</b> in previous discussions with him, he doesn't use a toolkit like GURPS for its "reality-modeling" properties. Rather, it's a useful mega-set of rules to mix and match components from in order to arrive at a totally customized and yes, rather focused play experience. Consider these two scenarios:<br/><br/>I want to play a scenario where the players portray God-fearing enforcers come to clean up a frontier town of sin.<br/><br/>I could play Dogs in the Vineyard and engage with rules about Just Talking, Sorcerers, Gunplay, Escalation, etc.<br/><br/>Or I could play GURPS with the following set of skills <i>only</i>:\n<ul>\n<li>Brawling*</li>\n<li>Diplomacy* (but <i>not</i> Persuasion)</li>\n<li>Fast Draw*</li>\n<li>Guns*</li>\n<li>Interrogation* (but <i>not</i> Detect Lies)</li>\n<li>Intimidation*</li>\n<li>Religious Ritual***</li>\n<li>Theology**</li>\n</ul>\n* These skills may only be attempted once per subject - once attempted, you must use a more "severe" skill if you want your intentions to have any effect<br/>** After succeeding at a Theology roll, may specify or contest a Truth about the Faith<br/>*** Success at a Religious Ritual roll may yield seemingly "supernatural" results at the GM's discretion<br/><br/>The same town-creation rules and guidelines for pacing are used in each. In the GURPS setup, because only a very small sub-set of skills are defined as valid choices, all conflicts will revolve around and be coloured by the nature of those skills.<br/><br/>For the most part, the GURPS method will work well at providing the same play experience as DitV, which is what the fictional JDCorley is after in this case. His players know the system well and can jump right in without having to worry about the finer system details.<br/><br/>However, partway through a session some unintended GURPS rule sneaks in and rears its ugly head - say, for example, the player is engaging in a high-noon showdown with his nephew, as a dust storm sweeps through the town, but due to blood loss he's out of Fatigue or somesuch and can't actually engage in combat. Well, that's really quite dull and contrary to the source material. Everyone at the table really wants the fight to happen on equal terms for dramatic reasons, so they agree to ignore the rules about blood loss and Fatigue for this particular conflict (or, for the nitpicky, agree to change the stats on the PC's sheets to not confer the crippling penalties).<br/><br/>If JD's still sneaking around here he may confirm or deny that this is how he runs his games, but this was my impression after discussing GURPS as a sim-engine with him a while back. I'm actually pretty intrigued with the notion of using a fuzzy toolkit to do rapid prototyping of highly thematic scenarios and then using something akin to "fudging" to keep it at-pace and on-theme. I'd like to hear more about this method of using fudging as a tool/technique and as a measure of sharpness in design for playtest.<br/><br/>By the way, compare <a href="http://imaginationsweatshop.com/?page_id=10" rel="nofollow">playstorming</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248025/#Comment_248025" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T07:13:59+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  7:13AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2009 7:29AM by komradebob.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. Thinking about this a bit more, isn't all fudging essentially about avoiding play stoppage when it comes down to it?<br/><br/>I mean, if a GM fudges to keep a PC from getting whacked, basically it also prevents that player from being excluded from active group-play until they've come up with a new character.<br/><br/>Fudging to stop a TPK means also preventing all character players from being knocked out of active play.<br/><br/>Fudging to prevent PCs from missing THE key clue in an investigative game keeps the game going forward, which prevents everyone from being knocked out of active play, GM included.<br/><br/>Fudging to overwrite an easy victory by PCs by way of lucky rolls against key enemies does something similar, in this case primarily by keeping the GM in active play, and the others due to a cascading effect of the GM being knocked out.<br/><br/>I've done all of those kinds of fudging at different times, and ultimately it all came down to a desire to keep the whole group in active play, <br/><br/>So anyway, I'm thinking that addressing those issues somehow gets around the urge to band-aid things by way of fudging die results.<br/><br/>This does lead me to another couple questions:<br/>Why is continued play important?<br/><br/>What is the minimal amount of group-play that is acceptable before a group will choose to accept a stoppage result and not choose to fudge it instead? <br/>Does it bear some kind of relation to the amount of effort involved in pre-play? <br/>Does it involve assumptions about genre conventions?<br/>(Both or of these have been my own reasons for fudging)<br/><br/>How much of this is wrapped up in long-developing styles of the culture of rpgs? Specifically, I'm thinking of stuff like lots of pre-game chargen work, the ideal of the on-going campaign, and just plain thick-ass rules texts, single player-to-single character play, small-regular-group play, GM responsibilty for setting/situation/world building.

And it's difficult to say what I think about the opposing view without sounding insulting. My only defense is that I don't <i>myself</i> consider it an insult if I factually state that I think that you don't know what you're talking about, and are indiscriminate in voicing your ill-informed opinions anyway. In the Internet I am a clear minority in this, of course, which is why I decided to not write full-length debate on the issue.<br/><br/>For instance, what you said about "interpreting" dice rolls... are you being intentionally obfuscatory by equating fudging with dice roll interpretation, or don't you just understand the difference? Or do you just prefer to pretend that all games are built to rely on GM fiat when this is clearly not the case? Or were you just purely stating your own limited, practical experience on the matter, effectively claiming that you've never played a game that made a distinction between interpreting dice rolls and fudging them? I don't really understand what you wrote in any way that'd make your thought seem well-considered.<br/><br/>Also, for what it's worth: I emphatically agree with Bob in that fudging is very likely a symptom of exposure to bad rules-design. If faulty procedures in a game didn't make it necessary, I suspect that we wouldn't see many people acclimatized to do it routinely, either. To me it seems that the things you achieve by fudging would be more cleanly and reliably done by not using dice in the role they are usually used at all; therefore it seems to make sense that if people weren't stuck playing games that don't fit their goals, they'd either play games that allow the GM to control outcomes without fudging, or games that don't require the GM to control the outcomes to prevent the game from breaking. It's only in this rotten middle ground that fudging lives, you don't usually see fudging in Nordic freeform nor well-designed structuralist games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248030/#Comment_248030" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T07:34:07+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  7:34AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, to clarify: I think that players who fudge in games they play are being quite rational.

My ire in this matter is directed purely at designers who continue making games that require this unfun (for me) practice, and for GMs who elevate this emergency measure into an exalted technique, which tends to mess with my fun when I end up playing a game with such a GM.<br/><br/>In other words: play on, it's no skin off my nose if you fudge at your own game. If you're stuck playing a game that requires fudging (because you like other parts of it so much, presumably), I even condone the practice. It's a much better alternative than having the game break down, I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248033/#Comment_248033" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T07:44:58+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  7:44AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The more I think about it, the more I suspect that fudging being okay must have bloomed as RPGs moved out of the hands of wargamers playing rpgs as an alternative type of single character based side "adventures" as part of a greater multiplayer competitive wargame campaign, and more into the hands of non-wargamers playing with smallish groups of friends playing to follow on the adventures of developing heroes.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, it gets an even bigger push to acceptability in that next stage of rpg style evolution where play moves from location based missions, to more flexible long term play, with individual characters being very important at the same time GMs are being expected to come up with at minimum "worlds" if not actual storylines (background plots in motion, Evul NPCs, whatever). It's also when chargen starts moving away from the random to the point buy (or at least template).<br/><br/>Except, of course, mechanically, a lot of the old stuff, built for the earlier style of play is still in place, if only because that's what the designers of newer games know and are working from. Also, the player base itself, especially the types of players likley to recruit entirely new players, are also familiar with that stuff. And, if it doesn't give them exactly what they want, it's vastly easier to kludge a band-aid than redesign from the ground up <b>and</b> retrain a whole bunch of players.<br/><br/>Which would kinda be the whole point of hacking gurps to play DitV, as per the example upthread, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248035/#Comment_248035" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T07:46:00+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  7:46AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Hmm.

Being killed, in most games, removes your agency. In games of player skill as embodied in character performance (DnD, Call of Cthulhu, etc) this keeps you at the top of your game due to trying to avoid the stick of having your player agency removed for a lengthy period of time. It doesn't have to be character death either - presumably something like Petrification or extended loss of sanity (where the Keeper removes your character) could be as bad or worse, and plenty of players would rather see their Special Ops guy killed than crippled due to that same loss of agency. Other games - like Zombie Cinema, for one example - does not remove your agency after your character has been killed. Thus, players are not preoccupied with having their characters succeed, but can rather focus on crafting a compelling story.<br/><br/>So, in games of skill (in tactics, resource management, investigation, etc), the ever-looming threat of agency loss improves the game by ensuring everyone's playing to the hilt. By short-circuiting the threat presented in the system you're also robbing the players of potentially thematic or intriguing gameplay - DnD 4E, for example, encourages teamwork by putting fallen comrades on a timer. During the average of 6 turns a character is dying, the rest of the party should have plenty of opportunities to revive her, stabilize her, or in the worst case scenario escape from the combat. By causing the felling blow to miss, the DM is robbing the group of a compelling and bonding gameplay experience.<br/><br/>When you're using a ruleset intended primarily as a game of skill as a means towards a game of dramatic storytelling, you might be right in that fudging is one appropriate technique to ameliorate the initial poor design choice, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248042/#Comment_248042" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T08:10:23+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  8:10AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When you're using a ruleset intended primarily as a game of skill as a means towards a game of dramatic storytelling, you might be right in that fudging is one appropriate technique to ameliorate the initial poor design choice, however.</blockquote>\nWell, I tend to be pretty forgiving of designers in the sense that they build from what they've seen before + what they can conceptualize + what they believe an audience will accept as a commercial product worthy of purchase ( something even more important in ye olden days prior to stuff like downloadable electronic copies).<br/><br/>(But yeah, lack/removal of of player agency is a killer.

Fudging:  the fraudulent claim to the authority granted by the rules.<br/><br/>2.  Fudging:  the ad-hoc overriding of a Fortune mechanic (or, more unusually, Karma) with Drama.<br/><br/>3.

Either simply "because I'm the GM" or because "oh actually we don't play with that rule".  The most maddening example, perhaps, was, "No you can't take 10 on that roll" (in D&amp;D3.5) when we were out of combat and not threatened.  (Followed by, "Well, just roll, and don't get a 1," which was equally annoying since a 1 isn't an auto-failure on skill rolls.)<br/><br/>I think that's a different kind of "fudging," though I actually think it's better labeled as pure GM Fiat.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248281/#Comment_248281" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T10:03:41+00:00" title="December 23, 2009 10:03AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I'm noticing a contextual pattern in this thread that I find interesting.<br/><br/>A lot of folks in this discussion are tending to, implicitly or explicitly, associate fudging dice rolls with some sort of... I don't know, duplicitous unilateral action on someone's part, usually the GM. I find it curious, because it speaks to an assumption that if you're going to fudge die rolls, you're not acting in good faith by default.<br/><br/>I haven't seen this kind of situation since I was a teenager, and it doesn't speak to any experiences in play I've had for years. And I think that different assumptions about intent and context are muddying the waters here a lot - there's a vast, vast amount of difference between secretly fudging a die roll result because you don't want the players to have killed your boss monster so quickly, and fudging a die roll because everyone at the table looks at the result and groans out their displeasure, because it's already 12:30 and that means we're going to have another round of combat and we have to work in the morning etc etc ad nauseum.<br/><br/>In the former situation, the problem has jack-all to do with whether a design is good or bad. It has to do with the fact that someone's not communicating their assumptions - it's a social issue, whether that person's being a dick and cheating or honestly believes s/he's altering the experience for the "benefit" of the play group.<br/><br/>I remember one World of Darkness game I played where I screwed the pooch and called for a roll when a player was trying to get some plot info out of an NPC. Fun scene, well-roleplayed, all that jazz, and the roll came up terrible. I knew I should have just given it to him, but you know, habit. I looked at the dice, looked at the player, and said, "Man, I'm really not comfortable with that result, after how we played that scene."<br/><br/>The player said, "Are you kidding? Because I failed, I was thinking I was going to wait until he's leaving his office that evening, jump him, and beat the info out of him." That turned out to be an excellent follow-up scene.<br/><br/>Talking helps. Context is king. I don't think you can look at a particular technique, like fudging dice rolls, in isolation of context and make a blanket value judgment about it. Well, strike that... you can. I don't think you should.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248283/#Comment_248283" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T10:10:29+00:00" title="December 23, 2009 10:10AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But don't you see, Leonard, the game should have ended before 12:30 at night, it's just bad design to count on fudging to end the game at a reasonable hour.

'Cause I think it can be hard to tell the difference, depending on your expectations. Hence my example - what I found interesting about that moment is that the system *did* give me a consequential result, and *I* was the only one who really had a problem with it. The player took up the challenge and interpreted it as, "Well, this approach isn't working, so clearly I need to take more drastic measures," and made a consequential choice. So for him, it kinda *was* something he didn't know he wanted (I mean, obviously, I don't know if he'd put it that way, but bear with me).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248309/#Comment_248309" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T11:50:33+00:00" title="December 23, 2009 11:50AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Leonard, to be clear for my part, I consider it bad game design when the game leaves a blank and says, "Uh, I dunno, fix it yourself however you want."<br/><br/>Give me something, ANYTHING, that YOU, the designer, found functional in this case -- take whatever ad-hoc procedure you followed to make the game continue, and write it down for me.

That's another interesting dichotomy in the thread - the discussion of fudging (or the need for it) as good/bad design, and the discussion of fudging as good/bad play. I think those are two different discussions too, that we're trying to have at the same time.

Assumptions and expectations are powerful things, and they can color our behavior unconsciously. While I think it's the responsibility of the designer to provide a complete set of tools, the fact is, people are going to do what they're going to do in play regardless of how complete that set is.<br/><br/>Or to put it another way, if I'm fudging dice rolls because I feel I have to, there's no real guarantee that the quality or intent of the design has any influence on why I feel that way. It might, but it might also just be an assumption I'm carrying from past experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248332/#Comment_248332" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T14:11:19+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  2:11PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True.
