I'll even take the hit of the IPR cut, because the simple act of you playing it at GenCon will probably result in five other sales.  Yes, even if the game you played at GenCon was a complete failure.<br/><br/>If you buy my game at GenCon, take it home to your side of the ocean, play it and dislike it... are you paying shipping to get the damned thing back to me?  Cause the five bucks shipping, plus the handful-of-bucks IPR cut, is going to very quickly add up.  Even selling that copy again (assuming it's still in salable quality) may not make that money back.  All of which is not to say that the answer would be no.  Probably, my answer would be "Sure, here's your money back," since I'd pay a couple of bucks for your goodwill as a (potentially future) customer.<br/><br/>I don't have an explicit refund policy, but I have given refunds before (usually for shipping errors).  Cultivating customer goodwill is almost always more important than a single sale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160486/#Comment_160486" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T14:34:34+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  2:34PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!<br/>Good luck with that one, Graham!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160488/#Comment_160488" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T14:47:56+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  2:47PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about a shareware deal?

The idea is give the basics of the game away for free and let folks play it, but then sell them on the umpteen micro sourcebooks, the deluxe edition of the game and a variety of world setting box sets and PDF content. That and to get them to engage, in mass, in an online community built to support the game and online shared world building.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly problem is that we are focused on our online strategy games right now, on the interactive side of things, and are a ways off before we can even think about solidifying our plans for the online support for the RPG. Further, the give away program calls for about $500K in capital to the program running in earnest with possibly another $500K needed to see the program to maturity. Once fully established, however, the giving away of the game should be a profit making venture unto itself. The challenges, besides setting aside the starting capital (we could open 10-12 retail stores or possibly more for that amount) is the development of large and steady distribution channels for the game give aways. To the tune of, say, 3 million copies finding good homes every 30 to 90 days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we're aways away from trying to put that particular venture into motion, the next best thing is adaptation of a core rules set that is designed for sale through the dollar store markets. We figure $1 is a fairly low risk amount to let someone get the taste of the game (well, that and the dollar store market skews to a different demographic and one we think is extremely important for building that game to where we ultimately want it). Unfortunately, entering the dollar store market is not itself an easy undertaking. In order to sell to a good half of the chains in that market we have to figure out how to become EDI compatible and preferably without having to hire a specialized EDI consultant to get us there (because they are darn expensive). We are not entirely sure that trying to enter the dollar store market without access to such chains as The Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, Dollar Genera and a few others is worthwhile. I mean, it probably would be worthwhile, but entering it without giving attention to the big chains at first might be shooting ourselves in the foot with regards to doing business with them later. The best possible solution might be finding a distributor that is EDI compatible, but on dollar store items, there isn't a lot of breathing room for introducing another tier to share the money with.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

And that would really tempt me to buy it.</blockquote>\nThere's a really, to me, interesting idea buried in here. Will your game appeal to Graham? Or, larger, will your game appeal to the person you are selling it to? Or, even larger, does the game go out of its way to figure out its target audience and only sell to them?<br/><br/>If I step into my local RPG shop, they will gladly sell me 4th. The game book will make little effort to tell me if I (or someone like me) will enjoy it and it will try to convince me to buy it, regardless of whether I am the type who will enjoy it. In the end I will hate 4th and that money is gone gone gone. Personally, I think it's a little disingenuous for the product to not try to select me out of its target audience. The same goes for a lot of other RPGs.<br/><br/>So yeah, if a seller of a game talks to me, Christopher Hearns (recall, Graham isn't talking about money back guarantees for everyone, just for him), and then sells me the game, I'd like them to know, or at the very least feel money back guarantee confident, that I will enjoy the game. Is that likely to happen? Maybe not, but then I'll just continue buying games the way I'm buying them, which is to say I will play (and most likely read) them before I purchase them.<br/><br/>Note, this is similar to one of the objectives of the Design Matters group if I understood it right. To match a game to the customer. Not so much to sell them a game. Although I do wonder if they would say to someone, "hmm... I don't think any of our games are a good fit for you."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160866/#Comment_160866" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T14:44:09+00:00" title="August  5, 2008  2:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing about a money back thing isn't that "Oh, no, I cheated you."

To match a game to the customer. Not so much to sell them a game. Although I do wonder if they would say to someone, "hmm... I don't think any of our games are a good fit for you."</blockquote>\n*shrugs* personally, I've had a good deal of practice telling people that <strong>carry</strong> doesn't sound like what they're looking for. I don't want anyone going home with a game they won't like, even (especially?) if it's a good game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
