It's GMless and the focus is on creating a layered narrative, based on the conceit that the players are all academics investigating and putting their own spin on some imaginary past event.<br/><br/>From the website:\n<blockquote>Revisionist History is a game meant for play by post (PBP) or play by e-mail (PBEM.) This game builds on inspiration from novels that present their stories as the diaries and letters of their subjects, novels like Dracula by Bram Stoker and House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski.<br/><br/>This game aims for a multi level narrative. You play a scholar studying the lives of people in the past. In the course of the game you simultaneously create the story you are researching as well as the story of your scholar. The game is created and presented as a narrative of a group of scholars who are piecing together the story of some event from various sources and who have their own agendas to fulfill with the story that is told. </blockquote>\nRead on.
