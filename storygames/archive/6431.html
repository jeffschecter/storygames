Witnesses tend to be naive to the true nature of the organization, Internal Hires are much more jaded, and Field Agents used to be hunted themselves and their loyalties are highly questionable and can change over time. However, there are alternate views of these employees: Witnesses are very new to this world and don't have too much influence, Internal Hires are taught from the beginning and have lots of influence, and Field Agents have prejudices to deal with, but some connections, too. Finally, if you look at it in terms of supernatural power, you'd have Witnesses in the middle, being exposed but new, Internal Hires as sub-par, suffering from their banal surroundings, and Field Agents with high power.<br/><br/>That is:\n<table>\n<tr align="center">\n<td></td>\n<td>Loyalty</td>\n<td>Influence</td>\n<td>Supernatural</td>\n</tr>\n<tr align="center">\n<td>Witnesses</td>\n<td> + </td>\n<td> -- </td>\n<td>  [ ]  </td>\n</tr>\n<tr align="center">\n<td>Internal Hires</td>\n<td> [ ] </td>\n<td> + </td>\n<td> --  </td>\n</tr>\n<tr align="center">\n<td>Field Agents</td>\n<td> -- </td>\n<td> [ ] </td>\n<td>  +  </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\nSo, you can label any type of agent on any of three views with the faces of a Fudge Die.<br/><br/>Anyone know what I can do with this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142627/#Comment_142627" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T08:45:18+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  8:45AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  Two things:<br/>\n1) I notice that no one has a "-" for Influence and no one has a [] for Supernatural, is that intentional?<br/>\n2) That answer seems obvious to me, bonus dice in regard to abilities in those realms. Or you could go the other way and provide cultural secret(s) (maybe even 2 or three tro represent the pluses and minuses) for each "culture"...<br/>\n  Good luck man!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142644/#Comment_142644" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T09:47:53+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  9:47AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I screwed up the Witnesses line. It's fixed now.<br/><br/>I was thinking more along the lines of this: In certain situations, after determining success or failure on your roll, look at which die type is in majority; this is the overriding motivator to your success or failure. For example, if you were arguing with a rival faction member who saw something they shouldn't have and you're trying to Sway them to back off, you could:<br/><br/>Succeed, with Pluses: You bring them to becoming loyal to you.<br/>Succeed, with Minuses: You call on your superiors, who pressure them politically.<br/>Succeed, with Zeroes: You alter their minds with a gadget you recovered from your stint in Atlantis.<br/><br/>The key point here is this: WHEN would this be appropriate? I'm not trying to solve a problem, but I'd love to see where this would fit in and add to the fun.<br/><br/>Maybe, also, the player could define their own categories of Plus, Minus and Zero?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
