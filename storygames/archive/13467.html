But I also thought about JDCorley's responses indicating that he'd gotten quite a bit out of the various "What is an RPG?" sections over time.<br/><br/>Now all of that swirling around together made me think more about player level procedures that make games work (or not!). I also got thinking that in a very real way, that stuff should come before any nitty-gritty discussion of procedure, and also that it shouldn't be buried off in some "advice" section. <br/><br/>So here's the excersise and what I'd like a response on:<br/><br/>You as the designer or GM/initiating player of a game have basically five main bullet points (with only a sentence or two of follow up at most) to describe what players* need to do to get good play from a game/style of game and why. Further, this stuff is going to be front and center in either a rulebook or a convention handout, and it of necessity might be the only real thing that the players read (or have read to them) prior to jumping into play.<br/><br/>(*For now, I'm going to assume character-players, not any sort of GM player.)<br/><br/>Feel free to choose a particular game or a style of play as you will, keeping in mind that if you're really specific about an indie game that I and any other readers may actually be in the position of that hypothetical convention goer reading one of these things!<br/><br/>( I suppose a short explanation of the overall rub of the game, a 3-4 paragraph sentence is also allowable before the bullet points if you really don't think folks are familiar with the game).<br/><br/>GO!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303702/#Comment_303702" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-08T13:17:08+00:00" title="December  8, 2010  1:17PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2010 1:17PM by David Artman.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For LARP (particularly boffer/airsoft):<br/>* You will act as your character at all times during the game (downtime is optional); <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and</span> but YOU ARE NOT YOUR CHARACTER.<br/>* You will engage in martial and ranged conflict safely, with controlled swings and aimed shots.<br/>* You will be clear about the effects you apply to others, but understanding if they can't hear you at times.<br/>* You will move about the venue safely and carefully, respecting out-of-bounds areas and other players' personal space.<br/>* You will help to entertain the others, help others portray their characters, and cooperate with organizers on both rules adjudication and venue maintenance<br/><br/>I figure if every player that came to LARPs did those things, all the other confusions, mistakes, and rules blunders can be hand-waved, forgiven, or corrected when the action isn't fast and furious.<br/><br/>Funny how they sound more "rule-like" because of LARP--no "advice" stuff here AT ALL, when it comes to player safety, maximizing the fun for the most folks, and the good of the LARP organization's reputation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303704/#Comment_303704" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-08T13:37:39+00:00" title="December  8, 2010  1:37PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David- if you were to add one or two sentence explanation/expansion on a couple of those you think are really important (especially if they're regularlymisunderstood) which ones would they be and what would you say?<br/><br/>(The last one in particular is interesting to me.

LARP is an escape, but only if it is free of constant reminders that it's unreal and, to some extent, contrived.<br/>That said, remember that others are in character also, and NEVER take in-character actions personally, as a player. Another PC might hate your PC, even as its player considers you a friend, enjoys your company, and is playing to make you have more fun and get spotlight time. After all... if that player didn't want to engage with you in-game, it is easy enough to ignore your character and its agendas in favor of other PCs and plots. Be flattered that the other player is using their precious game time to play with you.\n<blockquote>* You will help to entertain the others, help others portray their characters, and cooperate with organizers on both rules adjudication and venue maintenance</blockquote>The first clause of this rule reminds players to try to be "on," because nearly all social rewards of LARP result from appreciation of your efforts by the other players. It doesn't matter how "awesome" your PC is if no one ever enjoys the evidence of that or no one finds that it enhances their own game time.<br/>The second clause is a large part of improvisational acting: do not block others' efforts to entertain YOU. As much as you can while staying in character, "go along" with the leads given you by other players. Maybe their acting is awkward--so what? Help them be awesome, and they will become more confident of their voice and abilities to entertain, which will have a knock-on effect of making them more fun with which to play.<br/>The third clause reminds players that the organizers are in-game for all the same reasons that you are: to entertain you, to help you explore your character and pursue your agendas, and to help you be awesome (which makes you even more entertaining--see the virtuous spiral in action?). So when they make a rule decision, it's not to block you or to play favorites; it's to be sure everyone has similar spotlight time and be sure each spotlight shines as brightly as the other. Go with their judgments.<br/>Finally, it is just plain HARD to get a venue consistently, and all come with the classic Scouting duty to "leave the site better than you found it." Clean up when asked, and volunteer to do so if not. Never litter, and pick up the litter of your fellow players (or even previous venue users!) without complaint. When a host finds their venue in immaculate condition after a game, they are far more inclined to invite your group back, or even give your group preferential scheduling!<br/><br/>In a nutshell. Hell... that's going into GLASS.

A little of both I guess. The original thing that got me thinking about this was trying to figure out how to describe playing Bad Guys in a specific game ( Astounding Tales) to folks coming from a minis gaming background, presuming some limited experience with TT RPGs.<br/><br/>That game in particular has some very different constraints from most minis wargames and RPGs, so I was trying to figure out how to bulletpoint the player behaviors specifically appropriate to playing Baddies in that context. Essentially Baddies players in that context are shooting for an in-fiction loss to the Goodies ( with perhaps some minor victories along the way), but with a kind of MVP social level recognition at the end of the game.<br/><br/>This thread is kinda trying to suss out how that question relates to other sorts of games, especially some of the dirty-hippy games we talk about around these parts, which mess with the more common In-Fiction character win= Player level Win.<br/><br/>Make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303786/#Comment_303786" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-09T10:33:16+00:00" title="December  9, 2010 10:33AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to use this thread to try this out for the design I'm working on for next year's Gen Con games.<br/><br/>Title: Madness<br/><br/>1. This is a game about saving the world and slowly going insane. It is played in two parts: Investigation and Adventure<br/><br/>2. In Investigation you make up scenes about the wierd evil plots that are happening in your town. Roll a 7 or less on 2d6 and your scene passes the first check. Other players can add to or contradict you. If they contradict then roll again and the high roller wins.<br/><br/>3. In Adventure you make up scenes about the horrible things you find in the cultist lairs (which drive you insane) make jokes (which relieve insanity) and kick cultist butt. One player is the bad guy the others are heroes. Roll for scenes as above.<br/><br/>4. You get ten scenes per adventure but in the next round of investigation you only get as many scenes as you made scenes to drive yourself mad.<br/><br/>5. If you don't defeat the cultists the "Catastrometer" moves one step closer to the apocalypse (six levels). You move one step up the insanity scale each time you come back from an adventure insane (six levels before you are out of the game. <br/><br/>That was hard - and is not complete - but I like the idea of starting a rule book with this kind of overview.
