I'm always telling my players if I'm railroading or not. I don't see the point trying to hide it. That's why I think "illusionism" is a pretty strange term.<br/><br/>The thing is, even if I'm open with railroading my players, I can still give the illusion if player choice. Things that happens in the first scene may have importance in future scenes. Is it still illusionism? I define railroading as I got place A, B, C and D and the PCs have to get to those places in order (in looser rails: in any order). But when they are there, they may do whatever they want, probably creating consequences in future scenes. Is it still railroading? Illusionism?<br/><br/>Is railroading bad? No, it's a technique that can be used for several purposes. I usually use it for cool twists, like in The Usual Suspects, Stay or The Sixth Sense, but I can also use it as a scenario structure. In Feng Shui, I got a combat in the beginning to start things off and a combat at the end. What happens in between is up to the players. It's their duty to find a path to the end scene.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391663/#Comment_391663" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T12:33:30+00:00" title="September 28, 2012 12:33PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The critical issue is assent rather than knowledge.

Like in Old School Hack, the GM can use some of their Awesome Points to do things like say, "You get overwhelmed by guards and get arrested." or "Despite your best efforts, the villain slips out the back and lose him." Those can be railroad situations, arguably. You're not really giving the players a chance to react. But then again, this is basically just an AW Hard Move which seems to be an accepted tactic now-a-days.<br/><br/>This goes back to that GM fiat discussion that was going on not too long ago.

RPGs are primarily a mode of collaborative storytelling, and just like when a player can steal the spotlight and make a situation uncomfortable, I think the same thing applies with the GM too, and when it becomes a case of the GM telling the story they want to tell, rather than a story with the other players, then the railroading has gone too far.<br/><br/>However, light railroading is useful in some styles of game. In Adeptus Evangelion, for example, it is a great method of reminding the players that they are children and will be treated like that, no matter how big the robots they pilot, as well as increasing the overbearing atmosphere to drag out the social anxieties that all the players possess at their core. Similar styles can be used in any situation where the villain is particularly pro-active. GM fiat I would argue is useful to speed things up and as rulings, but it isn't OK to take choice out of the hands of the players (Exceptions being a one-shot where you need to get a viable plot out fast).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391689/#Comment_391689" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T16:15:29+00:00" title="September 28, 2012  4:15PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'Railroading' (using your authority over the game or over the other players to push the game towards a pre-planned outcome) is certainly a technique, and a nuanced one. Its appropriateness depends on the game and the attitude of the players. These are all quite different:<br/><br/><b>* You are playing a traditional game (GM + players) with a pre-set "plot" structure (Scene A, then Scene B, etc.). <br/></b><br/>A range of possible ways it plays out:<br/><br/>A. The players know the sequence of Scenes, and have assented to follow them.<br/><br/>B. The players know that there EXISTS a sequence of scenes, and have assented to follow it, but do not know the scenes themselves, and are looking forward to finding out what those are.<br/><br/>C. The players know that there EXISTS a sequence of scenes, but are interested in pushing the story in other directions (towards their particular characters' pursuits -- in other words, are not assenting to follow the sequence), while the GM tries to keep the game "on the rails". This is known to the players, in other words, but not explicit.<br/><br/>D. The players do not know that there is a sequence of scenes, and the GM tries to keep the game "on the rails". The GM doesn't mind if the players discover this fact, however.<br/><br/>E. The GM and game system/rules claim that the game is completely open to player initiative, but the GM is trying to "railroad" the players into a specific sequence of events without letting them know that's what he or she is doing.<br/><br/>F. The GM and game system/rules claim that the game is completely open to player initiative, but the GM denies this and is trying to "railroad" the players into a specific sequence of events, while the players stubbornly try to break free of the secret "road".<br/><br/>I don't know if I've covered everything (and railroaded/non-railroaded elements can cover different parts of the game, like a scenario which is open-ended until the very last scene, which happens no matter what). But there's definitely a spectrum, and different ways the players of the game can interact with the element of potential "railroading". Some of these will be functional (conducive to the goals of the game), others will be utterly toxic. <br/><br/>I'm guessing the toxic types happen when either:<br/><br/>a) the players (including the GM) feel that they are being lied to or otherwise deceived, so their trust in each other is undermined, or<br/><br/>b) the elements being railroaded are the same elements that the players care about most.

I mean, almost any technique can be abusive if you use it in a way that intentionally misleads and coerces other players, and "railroading" -- like most other techniques -- can be great if everyone is on-board.<br/><br/>One that specifically comes to mind is Marvel Heroic. How do the character get from Action Scene to Action Scene? Often, the GM just frames them there, at least in many of the published adventures, just like it's a pre-planned 4E battlemap fight. Sometimes the players have some leeway about what happens next, but not always. Players get to help determine how specific sequences of events play out, which may inform what future events are like, but they don't always get to decide where they go and what they do next. And smart GMs just frame those scenes rather than doing passive-aggressive tricks to try to convince the characters to do what they are "supposed" to. You can also play in looser, more improvized ways, but not in pre-written adventures as much.<br/><br/>Really, a lot of games with explicit scene-framing mechanics are like that. "The next scene takes place in the warehouse and Billy and Susanna are there" is much more railroading than "Are you there, Billy? What about you, Suzanna?" Even then, presumably SOMEONE has to be in the scene, right? I've rarely experienced games where somebody frames a scene that everyone rejects, though I guess it does happen.<br/><br/>Sometimes, in some games, you don't get to decide where you go or what you're doing next. That's totally a thing. Can it be abusive? Sure. Is it always abusive? Certainly not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391702/#Comment_391702" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T17:45:23+00:00" title="September 28, 2012  5:45PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2012 5:55PM by Jon_Shepherd.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, has anyone been poking around <a href="http://emshort.wordpress.com/2012/09/15/the-holographic-story/" rel="nofollow">Emily Short's</a> blog lately? She's been doing some research on something called "The Holographic Story" which has a lot of interesting implications for both collaborative and interactive fiction (whoops, here comes the semantics debate!).<br/><br/>Edit: I should probably explain the relevance. Some guy named N. J. Lowe explained a concept that along with the beat-by-beat timeline a reader mentally maintains while experiencing a work of fiction, there is also a anachronistic "holographic" mental model, containing a vague map of everything the reader has been told, everything they can reasonably guess based on genre and foreshadowing, and everything that has yet to be revealed. The holographic model begins as a blurry shape and is refined piece by piece, rather than being revealed top to bottom an inch at a time. Since railroading is essentially the technique of agreeing to events before they occur, I think this is something definitely worth looking into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_391717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391717/#Comment_391717" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T22:45:53+00:00" title="September 28, 2012 10:45PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2012 10:54PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">@Jon_Shepherd</a>: that "holographic mental-model" sounds intriguing!

There is no such thing as "no choice" in a role-playing game, James. From the minute you sit down to play a game, choice is taken away from you, yes. The moment one other player do something in character, you loose some options, yes ... <br/>- but you get some too, all the time; choices, new options, new ways of experiencing your character ...<br/>Railroading is barely about pre-planning the frames of interaction. The interaction itself is still full of choices for you to make. Your character is still yours to play with, in the scenes that comes along. To me your objections sounds more like refusal to go with the flow of the game. I know it is fairly common amongst role-players to act like that, but it is not the basis for constructive co-play.<br/><br/>And why on earth should we "prod" when all around the table know that <i>The Secret Base</i> is where the adventure lies?

It's true of storygaming, but it's not true of most "trad" styles of game, some of which have every bit as much of depth of character as storygames can have, with a great deal of player agency and breadth of scope and a general organic feel. The point being that many gamers are playing not to participate actively in the conscious construction of a story, but simply to enjoy "being" their character in some way. They may positively prefer NOT to have to think about the dramatic merits of the "story" or at a more basic level they may just want to think "in-character" and not have to think about what will make the game or "story" interesting, preferring simply to go wherever the character naturally takes them. They may feel drained or distracted or "jolted" out of their immersive state when they have to think too much in explicitly out-of-character terms. This being the case, players of that kind are NOT actively engaged in telling a story. When they state their character's intentions, they may be not really narrating anything so much as simply performing an illocutionary act, meaning "doing by speaking", just like when a bride or groom says "I do" in the marriage ceremony. I fully accept that this may not be the case for storygames, depending on what part of the game you're talking about, depending on the player and depending on what you mean by storygames. But for "trad" RPGs, thinking of them as storytelling games can lead to confusion.<br/><br/>NB trad gamers of the kind I describe can hate railroading with the same venom that many storygamers hate it with. Because it interferes with suspension of disbelief and it interferes with their sense of "ownership" of their character, both of which frequently are critical, by the way, to immersion in character, which is a big deal for many trad gamers [though by no means all].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391740/#Comment_391740" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T07:22:26+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  7:22AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Omnifray.

There is no such thing as "no choice" in a role-playing game, James.</blockquote>\nTo me the best definition of railroading is something along these lines:-<br/><br/><b>Absence of meaningful ability to influence the course of the events of the game</b> or <b>absence of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">meaningful</span> choice</b>.<br/><br/>Specifically the central case of railroading is that no matter what the players do to try to get off the rails, the GM sticks them right back on. So though they maybe briefly seemed to have a choice, the GM negated and nullified their choice. If the GM is always going to negate/nullify your choice whenever it goes off the rails, then you don't really have a choice to come off the rails. By putting you back on the rails, the GM in a sense retrospectively robs your choice of meaning, and retrospectively renders it not a choice, but just an impotent gesture. But that's just the central case of railroading, which the name comes from. The core essence of railroading is simply the absence of meaningful choice.<br/><br/>Why is that absence of meaningful choice important? For many players, the answer is "because it impacts on the player's sense of ownership of the character and thus on their sense of 'being' the character". For other players the answer may be "because the game is about collaboratively telling a story and this shoves the players out of that process of collaboration and makes them just an audience". There may be other answers too. But they all come back to the absence of meaningful choice.<br/><br/>The "out" is that what is "meaningful" choice is subjective. If you don't care about the course of the game's events and you only care about how you portray your character, maybe you might decide that for you a choice about the course of the game's events can never be meaningful anyway, so it doesn't really matter, AS LONG AS it doesn't interfere with your character's internal thought process and internal decision-making, and only "frustrates" your choices externally by their consequences, and not internally by dictating your character's thought-processes to you. BUT even so, railroading may interfere with your suspension of disbelief and thus break immersion in character.\n<blockquote>Would it be okay for a player other than the GM to "railroad" a session, invalidating the input and ideas of everyone else at the table?</blockquote>\nA loaded question perhaps, but an interesting one. I have one player who says to me that another player in the same group will inevitably turn every possible situation into combat. It's not exactly railroading in the classic sense, but it has the same impact on the other players' sense of agency, sense of ownership of their characters, sense of ownership of the "story" and suspension of disbelief. If you constantly escalate, escalate, escalate to physical combat / magical combat, that could be very selfish and rude if it's not consistent with other participants' preferences. It doesn't seem accurate to call it "railroading" but I can't see an important distinction of substance between that sort of behaviour and railroading. An extreme example would be a character with mind-control powers or enormous in-game social authority [e.g. being the king] whose player uses them in key ways to ensure that the group always has to follow their agenda.<br/><br/>Edited to add:- in a trad game, the solution lies with the GM, who can restore equilibrium to the situation. And therefore the blame for the situation also lies at least partly with the GM, if it's an ongoing situation which is never addressed. \n<blockquote>Can it be abusive? Sure. Is it always abusive? Certainly not.</blockquote>\nI think it would have to be a massively extreme case before the word "abusive" would be the appropriate word to describe a GM's approach to a game. E.g. forcing players who themselves have suffered sexual abuse to roleplay sexual abuse situations. I think there's a lot of discourse around storygames/RPGs which focuses far too much on the power dynamics within an RPG group and on the GM's fiat or authority as social power rather than as simply a cog in the inner workings of the game; GM fiat can be a valuable tool to facilitate a certain kind of playstyle for a group of players who desire to game that way. Focusing on the power dynamic really misses the point, IMHO. It's not about power. It's about facilitation. There might be a few screwball GMs who take advantage of GM fiat in crappy ways, and you could technically say they "abuse" GM fiat, but it's not really abuse <i>of the players</i> except in a truly extreme case.\n<blockquote>No. As long as YOU are the one making the final call, as a GM, we are taking about GM fiat. Not in the worst sense, but still.<br/></blockquote>\nThere's a bad sense of GM fiat?? GM fiat is a tool, good in good hands, poor in poor hands, or inconvenient if it's incompatible with your preferred playstyle (e.g. collaborative storytelling, which is a playstyle, and not the be-all and end-all of RPGs). GM fiat can't in and of itself be a "bad thing" outside a particular context of people's tastes and preferences for different playstyles.\n<blockquote>[Zachary Wolf said:-]<br/>Many people believe GM Fiat is back and is cool now.</blockquote>\nIt's never been "out" or "not cool" as far as I'm concerned!!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391743/#Comment_391743" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T07:46:23+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  7:46AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2012 7:59AM by omnifray.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I agree with Omnifray.

Not saying that storytelling games or storygames don't involve roleplaying too, just saying that when we're just talking about trad games, we can talk about collaborative roleplaying. People collaboratively create an atmosphere and social situation where they can roleplay their characters.<br/><br/>Edited to add:- <a href="/forums/profile/walterman">@walterman</a>, consider this. In Montsegur 1244 the game follows a set sequence of scenes and reaches a more or less pre-determined conclusion. Is that railroading? Is it the game-designer railroading the participants? The game simply wouldn't "work" if you went "off the rails"... there aren't even mechanics to deal with that situation... it would just end up totally freeform...<br/><br/>Another thought. If it was pre-agreed by the group that one player was going to be playing the King, and everyone would be following his lead, that would be something very close to and analogous to railroading, being done by one of the players, and it would be fine. If people agree to it, why not? If it doesn't interfere with what they're getting out of the game, whatever that may be, then it's fine isn't it. And whether it interferes with what they're getting out of the game is something only they can answer... However I have played in a tabletop game where there were three characters, my berserker, a wizard and a noble who was the commander of 60 troops who were with us at the time. When it came to key decisions and the noble inevitably got her way because she had 60 troops with her and [more critically] expected deference to authority, it sucked in a big way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391747/#Comment_391747" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T08:19:26+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  8:19AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh my gosh!

Well, there's a thin line between a hard move and coercing the creative agenda of the rest of the players, both can be railroading but the later also happens to break the social contract -which is why we dislike it. Yet looking at it well you can say that players make hard moves too (kill an important NPC before she spits out the information they need, sticking to a place instead of leaving to the next, etc) so Omnifray is right about trad games. Rule zero states GM fiat above the whole rulebook, so that part is undeniable.<br/><br/>However the gaming experiences that have shaped the current level of knowledge about GMcraft and playcraft have showed us that letting go of the competitive antagonistic behavior between players and GM can also be tons of fun. It allows collaborative storytelling and creates an original setting, made by the players. Which helps inmersion a lot, since players care more about whatever they create than about whatever the GM creates (unless the GM is really good) or whatever comes with the book.<br/><br/>So I'd say: railroad all you want, call it whatever you like, just don't break the friggin' social contract.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391750/#Comment_391750" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T08:26:55+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  8:26AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If players at the table are good with GMs or other players or designer "railroading" a game then the railroading is happening because of their decision.

The GM is a facilitator. Usually when I GM I actually feel emotionally on the player characters' side. Even so some players may feel that I'm out to get them. And yet, mysteriously, they nearly always survive and even triumph. I wonder how that could be!! Possibly because they're just being paranoid about it, or because I do a good job of hiding how much I'm rooting for the player characters? Maybe.\n<blockquote>Making a decision to accept "railroading" is a meaningful decision, in my opinion.</blockquote>\nWhat, like an "elective dictatorship"? It might be a meaningful decision but is it an in-character decision or a decision you get to make more than once in the game? If you're talking about players stating at the outset of a game that they understand they will be railroaded, that decision is pre-game, not in-game, and it's not a decision they make as their characters.\n<blockquote>Every one should be allowed the opportunity to have a "moment in the spotlight".</blockquote>\nWholehearted agreement here.\n<blockquote>even trad games are collaborative storytelling.

I agree that player characters' interaction with the world should should seem realistic, meaningful, reactive and responsive. I don't think that makes it storytelling. I agree that the GM is a facilitator, not a storyteller, and should supply a populated world, and that the players' interaction with it is what primarily directs the course of the game's events, which ultimately depends on the decisions the players make by in-character reasoning, and player agency is central. Hence, collaborative roleplaying. All I'm saying is that the players aren't engaged in telling a story. They're engaged in performing a series of illocutionary acts (doing by speaking). The players needn't and perhaps shouldn't have any conscious awareness during the game itself of the "needs of the story". They can and perhaps should simply reason and think in-character. As such, they are not telling the story; rather, they are engaged in "being" key components in the events of the course of the game, which I'm uncomfortable referring to in that context as a story, but you can call it that if you want. So they're "being" the story (or a central part of it), and not "telling" it. This in no way implies that the GM is dictating the course of the game's events or the "story". It may imply that the only person <i>consciously</i> influencing the course of the game's events to push them in more exciting directions is the GM, but the players may be doing that same thing subconsciously. And many a GM may be doing it without conscious thought too, but only subconsciously, like the players.<br/><br/>DISCLAIMER:- I am talking about the immersive approach to trad RPGs here, and what I say has no application to more storygamey approaches. Whatever's fun for you, more power to you.\n<blockquote>Ultimately I think I agree with WarriorMonk and walterman on this, its all about the social contract, and I would personally argue that when it presumes or invalidates the actions of characters, which in most trad games are the only thing that the players have any control over whatsoever, it goes too far.</blockquote>\nAnd "social contract". I hate that phrase. Such a crappy phrase. Why not just refer to the group's [loosely shared] expectations, or the group dynamics.

But it's more <i>Woo-Ha!</i> and exciting than the railroad.<br/><br/>All about expectations. One of the main conflicts I see in perception and tastes in RPG play is that it very often isn't set out strongly by GMs whether the style of play that they're shooting for is more A) Explore/live in world sandbox as your characters or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Make some characters who have reasons to go on this adventure/quest/solve the mystery.<br/><br/>Different game texts have implied that both of these are what happens, and the culture has picked both up. Coming into a game, those things may well be in conflict if different folks in the group have different ideas of which they are getting into in this particular case.<br/><br/>Of course, it can get even trickier when a guiding person in the group ( GM or otherwise) changes along the way.<br/><br/>I know that, as a GM, especially with a D&amp;D type et up, I have often alternated between the two, usually starting out with a "Let's go on an adventure!!!" approach for the first session or two, then moving to a sandbox/live it approach, and back to an adventure approach at different times when things seemed to becoming stale or too meandering.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391770/#Comment_391770" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T10:07:36+00:00" title="September 29, 2012 10:07AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In Feng Shui, I got a combat in the beginning to start things off and a combat at the end.

Perhaps I've understood it in the wrong way, but illusionism is when you're railroading and the players find out about it? The gaming  style in your group is broken? Illusionism implies that the players will find out about it sooner or later, but I can't agree with that opinion.<br/><br/>The thing is, I usually move things around in my railroaded adventures to adapt to the players plans. Yes, this means that if I planned an ambush in the forest and the players take the mountain road instead, I move the ambush there instead. The thing is, I never plan like that. I just plan for an ambush that will occur whatever the players will do.<br/><br/>I just read a thread that was about Trail of Cthulhu and one guy mentioned that the clues can be free and not bound to a certain place, and when the players do something they will get a clue. I use this a lot, no matter what game I game master. If the players invent a person on the spot that they want to talk to - "Lets talk to that merchant over there" - I reward them by giving out information about the scenario. If they want to break into a house, I reward that with information. I give positive feedback when they act, because I <i>want</i> them to act.<br/><br/>But this is just railroading. It's the same thing as the ambush. I planned for something, and whatever the players do, they will find out about it.<br/><br/>What's the people's opinion about this? Or is it different with a planned event (ambush) and information (clues)? That events force the players to react and information gives the option of what they will do with the information - "We know that the cardinal is summoning the demons. What shall we do?". On the other hand, bangs are all about creating events that the players have to react to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391771/#Comment_391771" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T10:28:44+00:00" title="September 29, 2012 10:28AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in a game where the railroad was so strict that NPCs were brought back and their plot points given to similar characters if something happened to the original.

Playing the entire series a few times, I would be happy to use it as introduction to players of any age, and I have not ever fudged a _single die_ in decades of rp.<br/><br/>I know nothing of Dungeon World, but maybe your modification of the basic adventure gave you anomalis results?<br/><br/>And saying that it takes away the meaningful choices? Like choosing what path of magic Rastlin takes? Or is relationship with his twin? These things are player choices! If you dont have White, Red, and Black magic then that takes away one of the central choices to Rastlin. His choice of divinity, or saving his twin, how does a single dice roll make that decision for you?<br/><br/>I would not flip a coin to determine which path of magic Rastlin would take, it is up to the player, and that is one of the most meaningful choices within the earlier part of the campaign, likewise the end his decision to defeat Tiamat is _not_ based on anything but the player.\n<blockquote>Some groups can still make something like the DL series work, of course, but it requires both buy-in to the railroad and a willingness to completely disregard the game's numerical rules.

Both using simple karma-based resolution, and by purely dramatic means.<br/><br/>Perhaps giving it another run, with a play-group of people that have experience with the AD&amp;D 1st Ed game system you will find that both it is not "all but guarantee deaths for the entire party", or lacking in choices regarding character motivations. Also not fudging dice probably would help a little, just ask the players to use tactics rather than "feats" or whatever is in Dungeon World, as to be honest this is you disregarding the mechanisms of the game, not anyone else.<br/><br/>Hope that helps to clear up things,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391811/#Comment_391811" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T16:10:09+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  4:10PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

Surely Trad simply means a roleplaying game with a degree of GM fiat and essentially minimal or nil sharing of narrative authority, where players act through their characters? By and large associated with "Actor Stance" and "Character Stance" though not exclusively so. In that sense, Trad has no necessarily negative connotations, depending of course on your own preferences. It certainly doesn't imply railroading (or hack-n-slash, or dungeon-crawling), though when something a bit like railroading happens outside the context of a Trad game, you probably wouldn't call it railroading (e.g. the scene-based structure of Montsegur 1244).\n<blockquote><br/><br/>So this is where you get the need for the GM to fudge die rolls to ensure PC survival. Which then takes away meaningful choice in all sorts of ways.</blockquote>\nWhilst I can't comment on the DL modules I would agree that if the GM is constantly fudging die-rolls to ensure PC survival then that may remove an element of meaningful choice which is akin to railroading in some respects. Of course, there can be meaningful choice other than the choice to risk life and limb, so it doesn't necessarily take away ALL meaningful choice, and might not ruin the game, depending on all the circumstances. Indeed, some storygames specifically give player characters script immunity, and it would be a surprising assertion to state that the players have NO meaningful choice in such games. If players can have meaningful choice despite having explicitly recognised script-immunity, how is fudged/disguised script-immunity different? Maybe the main difference is that a player might feel they are being tricked or that the GM is cheating? Surely that's a question of player expectations. You can house-rule script-immunity into a D&amp;D game and openly fudge the dice-rolls. How is that different to script immunity in storygames?\n<blockquote><br/><br/>By the way, I also want to address something I saw upthread about the nature of story games versus trad games.

BUT I might get to that conclusion starting from more basic principles. <br/><br/>A game where all the players must do is simply play their characters may qualify perfectly well as a trad game in my eyes. It seems odd to think that a game could simultaneously have all the core features of a storygame and all the core features of a trad game. <br/><br/>For me, the defining line is this:- is your primary purpose [as a player] to tell a story [whether or not by conscious effort], or is it something else, perhaps simply to pretend to be [and perhaps feel like or imagine being] your character? It's still not an infallible demarcation though. Because human action doesn't always have a primary purpose... and you could have twin purposes of telling a story and imagining being your character, without being able to prefer one over the other. And also, notice that this is a personal thing for each player. One player might be storygaming, and another might be gaming in a trad way, at the same table, seamlessly and without problems interfacing with each other and the game.<br/><br/>I tend to think that there's no point calling it a storygame if the story part stops at character creation. <i><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So what</span></b></i> if the character creation system is designed to sew conflict for you to reap later? It's just character creation. It's preliminary to the game. It's not of the essence of the game itself. You could arrive at the same point with any trad game simply by writing up a backstory full of conflict potential for your character during CharGen, and that's perfectly trad. Why call such a game a storygame and not a trad game? Why does it make a difference if the CharGen system hardwires that into the game? The division between storygame and trad game is surely most fundamentally in the execution, not necessarily to be found in the basic design.<br/><br/>Therefore I tend to think that to really be a storygame there has to be a focus on "our story" during play. Which means that the player has to be thinking at some level about making the story. And that basically equates to at least occasional "Author-" -stance thinking, be it conscious or I suppose subconscious. Ay, there's the rub. Subconscious will probably do the trick, especially if you had it in mind to start with...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391815/#Comment_391815" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T16:34:32+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  4:34PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Wow! I would love to hear why you two have such different experiences with that module.

Cameron as a Wizard (not canon but was interesting) in dramatic and karma based resolutions.<br/><br/>I have run the DL series for a group of kids as young as 4yo, after they watched the series (Kitika and Goldmoon seem to be the popular ones, (Kitika is my fav btw)). I cant recall anyone dying except Rastlin at the end, and maybe Sturm died once by player choice.<br/><br/>But yeah I am happy to play both dramatic and karma based resolution as well as the conventional fortune as resolution. It makes it a lot quicker when you are not rolling dice.<br/><br/>But even with Rules As Written I found that using tactics such as retreating and ranged weapons, also knowing how to play spell-casters, when to rest, et al generally having a good understanding of the tactical side of AD&amp;D was a necessity for most players.<br/><br/>Most importantly I finished the series, it is a long one, and the first book out of fourteen does not have many of the "key" plot points that I mentioned earlier. And I enjoy all of the characters, they are well written giving the player choices on what they want to do, and they are varied in their personalities and objectives even if they are united under the same banner of defeating Tiamat.<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391828/#Comment_391828" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T22:08:14+00:00" title="September 29, 2012 10:08PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...everything I thought I knew about RPGs is wrong... all of it, every scrap                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391833/#Comment_391833" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T23:45:22+00:00" title="September 29, 2012 11:45PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Komradebob got it right a few posts ago: the terms are Railroad and Rollercoaster. The first one breaks the social contract, the second keeps the Flow going. Yes Onmifray, I wrote Social Contract again, and I'm sorry about that but it is a contract: "A contract is an agreement entered into voluntarily by two parties or more with the intention of creating a legal obligation, which may have elements in writing, though contracts can be made orally"<br/><br/>Ok, perhaps we're pushing it since the social contract is always made in a totally unprofessional way: players assume many things that are left unspoken (there ar exceptions of course), everybody comes to the table with different expectations (this has exceptions too) and it's never stated which of those expectations are gonna be fulfilled (this too, obviously) -even when part of that contract is actually written in every single RPG corebook.<br/><br/>Notice that all this doesn't make the contract less "sacred". Players get frustrated when their expectations aren't met, as well as GMs. Players claim "it's railroad!" and embark in an effort to break the whole campaign and ruin every effort of the GM to keep her creative agenda going, or just accept and deal with it. Or even go the opposite claiming "Gimme my illusory rollercoaster!" and confront the GM directly doubting the strenght of her creative agenda. <br/><br/>And on the other side, GM's abuse GM fiat to put the players back on the track, rely on illusionism or are caught flat-footed by the players asking them for less options and more emotions.<br/><br/>Good playcraft and good GMcraft can do magic on each situation. And inform players on what constitutes good GMcraft and playcraft in the corebook is a golden advice. But in the end we're back to the Social Contract, which for the particular case of RPGs begins when we state what game we're gonna play, what's the game about and how the rules go. And many other more important things that we end assuming or that we prefer no to talk about since it could break the inmersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_391836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391836/#Comment_391836" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T00:44:17+00:00" title="September 30, 2012 12:44AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2012 12:48AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...everything I thought I knew about RPGs is wrong... all of it, every scrap</blockquote>How delightful!

I'm fully aware that it's a mainstream topic of political theory. Was it something to do with John Locke? Anyway, the fact is, it's not a contract, and here's the thing. I can accept that a contract can be inferred from tacit behavioural indications of agreement, without even an express exchange of oral promises. Contracts escaped the formality of the <i>stipulatio</i> in the Roman era, if not earlier. The point is that actual contracts (1) exist within legal regimes, not just a broader social context, and (2) have a definite content or can be given a definite content by some tribunal, court or like body with authority to adjudicate on them. Insofar as treaties in international law could be considered contracts in the absence of international adjudicating bodies such as the International Court of Justice or the WTO Appellate Body, there may, I accept, be lacunae in something which could loosely be called a contract. But still, they had/have a great deal of definite content. And beyond that, and more fundamentally, they exist in the context of a legal system. The debate on what makes a legal system is not straightforward, and the term "international law" may in some contexts be a misnomer. "International lawlessness" might be better. [The WTO Appellate Body's work is perhaps an exception.] But applying the term "contract" to what is commonly called the "social contract" is just repugnant to me. Everyone's idea of what a given "social contract" stipulates will be different, and there's no applicable legal system. Among other things, theorists use the term "social contract" to try to justify the submission of the individual to the state, as if the voluntary character of the "contract" carried some moral force. But the fact is that the "contract" is not of a voluntary character. You're born in a country you're a citizen of, and you can't easily emigrate. Certainly as a child younger than 18, you have no real choice about the laws you submit to, yet you're still subject to them. As an adult, emigrating is possible but difficult, and wherever you go, you'll still have to submit to laws. You can't live on Mars, and by the time you can, it'll probably have a nascent legal regime imposed on it by Terrestrial imperialists. Anyway, sorry TomasHVM if my post has spurred you to unwittingly oppose the accepted (but to me, idiosyncratically, repugnant) common parlance of social contracts, which, by the way, is certainly a focus of jurisprudence in Germany and not just in America. However I would say this. Appeals to "social contract" generally set the wrong tone for a discussion about RPGs. They tend to sound a bit... well, frankly, a bit whingey and antagonistic.<br/><br/>@ <b>Deliverator</b>, presumably you're being sarcastic, but if not, you're being too hard on yourself. And if you are being sarcastic, I think maybe you're being too hard on us (especially me). I certainly wasn't aiming at shooting down everything you think about RPGs. In fact, re-reading my post where I responded to some of your points, I was indicating partial agreement with some of them at least. And, it's all just ideas about how and why we play games, isn't it? It's nothing to be taken too personally... So, er, chin up, ok?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_391862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

railroading is a tool that may be used effectively to help immersion and engagement in a game. ...</blockquote>\nRailroading is a technique like "it slipped" is a technique. It might work out for you, sure. They might not leave the table, fine. But, it's not classy GM'ing. And no, telling them as you're doing it does not make it classy.<br/><br/>The GM uses railroading not as a means to create a brilliant plot; but, as a means to cover their GM'ing faults. Namely 1) GM's who rely mostly or entirely on prep who won't or can't be flexible in play and 2) GM's who've decided how the story will resolve and who expect you to play the bit part along the way. A GM might easily confuse <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> with good technique. If this wasn't an interactive medium, fine.<br/><br/>If the players want to turn right, because they think right is awesome, and the GM wants them to turn left, the GM ought to make the left turn the super awesome alternative instead of making the right turn impossible. If the GM makes the left turn sound super awesome and they still want to turn right, it's probably a sign that left turn really isn't as great as the GM thinks it is. RPG jargon aside, the denial of right turns is the railroad and, if you've been on the recieving end of railroading, it's clearly a dick move, regardless of the game's outcome.<br/><br/>GM's are neither omnipotent nor infallable, so yeilding to player interest is not a sign of weakness. At the heart of good GM'ing is creative improvisation: put the characters in a sandbox and give them several avenues to draw their attention and interest somewhere and, if they choose option E, none of the above, go with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391864/#Comment_391864" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T10:55:06+00:00" title="September 30, 2012 10:55AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another question.

You seem to have missed that point, Paul.</blockquote>\nObviously I missed the point. <br/><br/>As a player, even though I don't want to rescue the princess, because I don't care about the princess (and I'm probably not the only player at the table that doesn't), I'm really just missing the GM's point. If only I rescued the princess, then I'd understand how great the story would be. So, instead of eloping with the sassy bar wench, I'm dragged into the King's court by armed guards to hear the GM monologue at me about saving his daughter. My gameplay experience is now greatly enhanced.<br/><br/>The point you're missing is that the GM isn't the only person at the table whose intrest in what aspects of the fiction recieve focus, matters. So when the GM takes away player choice, it's a bully tactic, well meaning or not, to get specifically what the GM wants from the game at the expense of what some or all of the players want from the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391886/#Comment_391886" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T14:35:56+00:00" title="September 30, 2012  2:35PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2012 2:41PM by omnifray.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Paul Riddle, I agree with TomasHVM that you've missed the point.<br/><br/>To "get" the point, you'd have to abandon what looks like it might possibly be (though I'm not certain) one of your fundamental axioms - that what people playing the game are interested in is the course that the events of the game (the "story") take and what aspects of the game's events receive focus. Sure, for some players, that's what matters. For others, all that matters is kicking butt. For yet others, what matters is having a context in which they can pretend to be their character, imagine being their character, feel somewhat like their character and maybe even feel somewhat as if they are their character. And for some players, the importance of that far outweighs the importance of the course of the game's events. That culminates in immersion or [if we must be more specific] immersion in character.<br/><br/>Perhaps you're actually one of those gamers yourself. I wouldn't be surprised. Because most of them hate railroading as much as storygamers do. Why? Because railroading breaks their suspension of disbelief, it breaks their sense of ownership of their characters and by these means or others it breaks their immersion in character. They can see the wires attached to the puppet. They no longer feel that they really are their character, because if they really were their character, they'd be able to make meaningful decisions. So they snap out of immersion and the game loses its special thrill for them.<br/><br/>And maybe I'm one of those gamers myself. Maybe I couldn't hack that kind of railroading either.<br/><br/>But here's the thing. From Tomas' experience (and he mentions that he gets paid to GM), if it's done skilfully, it can be done in a way that some players, at least, enjoy, allowing them to experience immersion.<br/><br/>As a thought experiment, imagine a gamer who doesn't care at all what's happening in the game, as long as he's immersed. In fact I've known gamers like that, or at least one I can think of via the Pundit's forum. For such a gamer, railroading, if it doesn't actually break his immersion, might be an irrelevance. <br/><br/>The point is that there is a lot more to RPGs than simply "story" in the sense of the course that the game's events take, and there is a lot more to playing and enjoying RPGs than simply influencing the "story" or the course that the game's events take. Of course, it's all very individual and largely subjective - some people are in it for the story and to be part of the storytelling collective, and for them, of course, railroading is inherently anathema. For other kinds of gamer, on the other hand, and not just powergamers or wargamers but also immersive roleplayers in the sense of immersion in character, the fact is that whilst railroading might be repugnant to many, that isn't a direct and inevitable logical consequence of the inherent nature of railroading. You need more by way of axioms and logical steps before such gamers arrive at the understandable conclusion that railroading stinks. So there must, theoretically at least, be some way for railroading not to necessarily stink in the eyes of some such gamers. And Tomas is reporting actual experience of it apparently working not just well, but well enough for him to be paid for it, repeatedly, over many years.<br/><br/>It comes as quite a surprise to me, as most serious immersive gamers I know, as well as most dedicated storygamers I know, detest railroading. But as I've already said, it can work brilliantly in LARP, so why not in tabletop?<br/><br/>I did have some more thoughts on the LARP analogy though. In a physically active LARP (with nerf guns or foam swords), no amount of railroading can manifest itself in quite the same obnoxious way that railroading can manifest itself in tabletop. Why? Because the ref can't stand over every player in a LARP and tell them where they feel like standing or which door they feel like opening. The ref just can't be everywhere at once and he can't micromanage physical actions that the players perform. <br/><br/>A LARP ref can however railroad the general sequence of encounters, monster attacks etc. And IME, a LOT of LARP works that way. They even call some LARP adventures "linears", as play can really only go in one direction. And that doesn't come even close to making it un-fun, or taking away meaningful choice from the players. BTW the same ref teams will often put huge effort into facilitating player-led plot in other events for the same game system and characters.<br/><br/>And even the crappy kind of railroading you often get from rubbishy GMs doing tabletop hardly counts as bullying in my book. I mean, the guy's putting heart and soul into laying on a game, he's doing hours of prep - it's hardly bullying is it. It might be a bit dull-witted and mildly obnoxious but that's the extent of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391887/#Comment_391887" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T14:37:57+00:00" title="September 30, 2012  2:37PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope you're playing a shared GMing game, Paul.

To me, there are several ways to enjoy roleplaying games. Acting, immersion, wargaming, building stories, play out moral questions, discover a story et c. No way is more "classy" than the other. Just different ways to play RPGs.

It is mostly something done by inexperienced and insecure GMs, as a misunderstanding of how an RPG shall be played, and as such it is far from any ideal interaction. I have experienced it myself, and I were put off by it, in my very first RPG-session ever.<br/><br/>The reason I found out it is an effective tool, is that I tend to challenge popular opinion in my design, to see if there are nuggets of gold buried underneath our preconceptions. No one had anything good to say about railroading, so I purported to dig into it ... <br/>- and there was, indeed, gold to be found! <br/><br/>Used as a tool to direct focus on certain aspects of interaction (character inter-relations and psycho-social states), and to down-play others (the choice of roads), railroading is very effective. By applying it with skill, maintaining player motivation, you get the players to concentrate on each single conflict as is, and to play their characters with more vigor. You get to concentrate your efforts too, as a scenario-writer, on the scenes you know will be included, and may weave very interesting challenges for the characters. <br/><br/>It is still possible to do this very badly, of course, but done right it has a lot of potential for great interaction. It is one more tool to have in your toolbox, as a game-smith or scenario-writer. Not to be used all the time, but to be taken out now and then, to surprise and entertain and challenge your players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391902/#Comment_391902" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T16:57:06+00:00" title="September 30, 2012  4:57PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to railroad in my games all the time.

As an example, I might just wing making up mechanics in a car chase if it hapens once in a blue moon in my game, even if there are set out mechanics available.<br/><br/>There are lots of folks who really latch onto the idea that a long, open-ended campaign is the absolute best way to play and gear their play towards that end. By comparison, anything short is inherently not as good. Likewise, things that may make short term play work better are not as well explored.<br/><br/>There's a huge aura of bullshit surrounding GMing. On one hand it intimidates ( My god! they've studied that big tome of rules and learnt themall???!!!  I could never be a GM!!!). On the other, it looks elite ( Yes, I have learnt all of those! Follow my lead! it's my reward for doing what y'all wouldn't!).<br/><br/>Also, and I know a couple of you guys hate the term social contract, there isn't a whole lot of up front discussion or understanding or open clarity about what different people give of themselves and want for themselves in a group creative context. There's often poor understanding that everyone does give stuff, to each other, and just how important that is in a group context. There also can be a poor understanding of how the whole group works in that sense. If you come to play a charcter and really want to get into that character's mindset, I can tacitly agree to do things to help that along as GM. But I also want stuff. i want you to explore my cool world, or experience the cool adventure I've dreamed up. Somehow, we've got to create an exchange of goodness that not only satisfies you and I, but also gets everyone else involved. The exchange agreement isn't just between the one character player and the GM, but in a spiderweb of support and exchange between everyone.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391969/#Comment_391969" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T12:13:44+00:00" title="October  1, 2012 12:13PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have an idea.

I remember one scenario that I got pushed in my hand at a convention, where one of the PCs were going to murder a NPC in the beginning of the game, so the NPC can come back and be a major villain.<br/><br/>Why should I railroad my players into a certain situation that the whole scenario depends on?

I was GMing a play-by-post one time where each character had their own "prelude" story where they were alone and got to explore their characters prior to being brought together into a group. After each player's prelude got to a decent stopping point, I had them each individually captured by the enemies and thrown into the same prison truck as a way to bring them all together. I explained that this was the plan from the start - they'd each get a prelude and then I'd do something in fiction to force them together.<br/><br/>When the time came, I basically narrated a scene where the character was overwhelmed by enemies and captured. One of the players emphatically remarked that, while he didn't mind being railroaded for the sake of the story, he didn't like the way I did it. He said next time, I should actually start up a combat and have the enemies beat him up until he was knocked out with subdual damage.<br/><br/>So essentially, this player didn't mind being railroaded as long as it was forced through the mechanics, and not just narrated straight up by the GM, which runs contrary to what most people are saying here.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392124/#Comment_392124" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T13:39:43+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  1:39PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Railroading.<br/>  I think we are talking about two separate techniques:<br/>1) Railroading - GM introduces an NPC who is paying money for the players to visit some ruins south of town. Players say, "we aren't interested," and leave town headed north. At which point they run across some ruins. This is dysfunctional play and should be avoided<br/>2) Game Mastering - The GM says to the players, I spent the last week making a cool Ruins-based dungeon. Wanna try it? The distinguishing characteristic here is the open communication.<br/>  I think that it sends bad signals to Game designers, other GMs and players alike to say that railroading can be a good thing. I think if we loosen railroading to mean that "the players have to go to per-ordained locations for the game to proceed" is doing a disservice to all the players who have been exposed to dysfunctional railroading. The moment that the players are informed (assent or not) railroading has stopped existing and Game Mastering has started. The reality of many RPGs is that there is prep that has to happen and if this prep is not used, the game will suffer.<br/>  There will always be times where the game is stopped until Event X happens, whether that is the players going to a certain location, talking to a certain PC or whatever. The difference between this being a crappy session and it being an interesting challenge revolves around communication of expectations.<br/>  I know I am late to this conversation, but I hope my little contribution helps us understand and communicate about this phenomenon better.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392125/#Comment_392125" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T13:41:20+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  1:41PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So essentially, this player didn't mind being railroaded as long as it was forced through the mechanics, and not just narrated straight up by the GM, which runs contrary to what most people are saying here. </blockquote>\nYes, it's just the opposite opinion to mine. I guess what this debate shows is that, even if folks <i>say </i>they don't like being railroaded, it seems there is usually a way for it to be acceptable, either within the fiction, the mechanics, or GM intervention, rather like everybody having their price.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392174/#Comment_392174" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T01:40:52+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  1:40AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think that it sends bad signals to Game designers, other GMs and players alike to say that railroading can be a good thing. </blockquote>Not at all!

But to call all pre-plotted courses rails is disastrous to effective discourse.<br/>  I don't understand why people feel the need to say "railroading is a good thing" when there are so many examples of dysfunctional game play. And all the examples of so-called good railroading end up not being railroading at all. Every GM who has said, I do railroading and it works out, who has shared their techniques consistently diverged from the classic definition of railroading. Therefore, I think it is a lost cause to try and say railroading is good or to expand the definition to include functional game play. I mean what we gain by altering the definition vs what we lose in civil discourse is not worth it. In contrast, I think expanding the definition of roleplaying gaming to include games like Zombie Cinema is beneficial as it lowers artificial boundaries to discussion and/or community.<br/>Dave                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392228/#Comment_392228" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T09:54:18+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  9:54AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2012 9:55AM by Rickard.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Therefore, I think it is a lost cause to try and say railroading is good or to expand the definition to include functional game play.</blockquote>\nI'm confused.

But, when so many people have such a viscerally negative response to the term, trying to say that it is a good thing doesn't seem to be very productive.<br/>  Just looking at this thread is painful. I mean, you have a group of people who can legitimately say, I have railroaded and it was horrible and I have been railroaded and it was horrible. And then other people who are using a broader definition say, "Wait, no, railroading is not horrible, it is a good thing." I am just trying to point out this disconnect. we aren't agreeing on anything, not because of trad vs. story-games or actor vs author, but because we are talking about different phenomenon. One person is talking about the horrible experience of being stripped of choices without forewarning or even acknowledgement that it happened. The other person is talking about having some parts of the session mapped out and letting the players know about it. Surely, you can see that those are different things? So, why use the same name for both? Especially when one is so clearly a bad way to play.<br/>  I just feel like if you are participating in functional game play, don't try to appropriate a negative term to describe it. I mean, once a term has negative connotations, let it go man. That's all I am trying to say. Probably no one will listen to me.

Or maybe any fictional situation where dice rolls and rules usually determine if his character "loses". He said he didn't mind being railroaded for the sake of the story, but maybe he wanted his character to have a chance to not get captured via dice rolls and mechanics? Maybe he didn't like the fact that my "cut-scening" was ignoring the rules? I never really pulled one of these for the remainder of the campaign so I don't really have anything to compare to unfortunately. The only reason I did it in the first place was to facilitate the preludes while we waited for more people to sign up and make characters and after that it was pretty much sand-box.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392281/#Comment_392281" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T17:19:37+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  5:19PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>But if the players chooses the scenes, they aren't normally rails.

What then?</blockquote>\nI'm kind of thinking that's why my player wanted to have an actual combat, so that he had a chance to thwart the railroad. If he actually lost the fight, then the rules supported where I, as the GM, wanted to take the game and it technically ceased to be a railroad. Otherwise, he should have been given a chance to avoid capture. But that goes against the agreement we made in the beginning that I was going to let them have their own individual preludes, and then force them fictionally together. Maybe that was bad GMcraft? I think that's a matter of taste.<br/><br/>I feel like it comes down to the fact that some people don't mind their character automatically "losing" for the sake of fictional positioning while others see this as the GM doing something unfair to get their way.<br/><br/>What if, instead of skipping the combat and capturing the character, I skipped the combat and had the player win the fight and avoid capture? I wonder if he would have taken issue with that?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392349/#Comment_392349" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-04T11:35:03+00:00" title="October  4, 2012 11:35AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RE: Don't skip the combat<br/>  It may be that the player wants to establish facts about the capturing scene. Like maybe he got captured, but he took out 3 of them before they took him down. With a cut scene, those facts are established for him, if they are even covered at all. Then it avoids the player claiming he took out three guys and the fiction becoming he lied about his prowess. That is just a guess, but the few times I have wanted to play the combat from a cut scene, that was the motivation.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392374/#Comment_392374" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-04T16:38:27+00:00" title="October  4, 2012  4:38PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So I can't railroad 'in the moment'?

It leads through dense woods, with a moody darkness, and then it leads out on some cliffs, with a breathtaking view! And from those cliffs the trail is winding down to a beautiful lake only you know about, with a sandy shore and flowers aplenty, deer grassing on the other side and a nice place to make a campfire. This is your favorite trail, and even though you know where it goes, and what the sights are, you walk it as often as you can ...<br/>- why? <br/>Well, you know it is good for a great day in the woods! It will deliver these things each and every time you go there; joy, serenity and a healthy hike for your body.<br/><br/>But then, some days you go into the woods in another way; you follow trails less known, make choices about trails when they split up, explore unknown parts, delve into the joy of being in the woods, come upon unexpected serene sightings, get real knackered by climbing, running, carrying your tent with you. And you come upon this nice spot, on a hilltop, with a vista of the snow-covered mountains to the east. In the sunset they glow like fire! And you; sitting by the campfire in front of your tent, glow like fire inside too ...<br/>- why?<br/>Well, you have had a great day in the woods! It has delivered these things to you; joy, serenity and a healthy hike for your body.<br/><br/>The trail is not important; it is the things we experience in the deep woods that counts. We may experience great things by pre-planning where to go, and then go there. And we may experience great things by breaking new trails.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392433/#Comment_392433" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-05T07:06:05+00:00" title="October  5, 2012  7:06AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A pure railroad is like the following dungeon crawl.

Video games are a good example since there is a finite amount of content so developers often give players the illusion of choice when really the same thing ends up happening no matter. Take Mass Effect - some dialog options are very different, but many of them garner the same response from the NPC. I ran into this dilemma when creating Neverwinter Nights modules. I ended up scrapping any "evil" dialog options because it was hard to justify the key NPC's continuing to work with a character that's blatantly a dick.<br/><br/>With role-playing games, content is infinite so the illusion of choice is almost always a bad thing and  can definitely be devisive. I think the term "railroading" can be split down the middle into "cutscene" and "illusion of choice". Both instances take away player choice, but one of them is agreed upon while the other is essentially lying.<br/><br/>The illusion of choice has inherent dishonesty associated with it - the GM is hiding the fact that the player's choice doesn't matter, removing the opportunity to discuss and agree (or disagree). Infact, it's kind of patronizing in a way, like "Oh yeah sure, you can pick either door (mumble but you're gunna end up in the same place anyways, hehe)".<br/><br/>Cutscenes or otherwise agreed fictional outcomes to me are a positive side of railroading. This is still taking the choice away, but doing so openly and with the permission of the player.<br/><br/>Some players just may not like railroading in either sense. I think people who normally or only take a Player role are less likely to agree to meta-controlling the fiction, probably due to a desire for immersion and maybe even a mentality of an underdog trying to survive whatever the GM is planning. People who normally or only take on the GM role are more likely to think in terms of what would make the story interesting, with less concern about immersion or freedom of choice on the player side. GMs are used to thinking about manipulating the fiction for story purposes while players are used to experiencing it and trying to succeed.<br/><br/>Personally, I've done enough of each to be open to cutscening or pre-agreed outcomes as a player, but would definitely resent an illusion of choice if I saw it happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392470/#Comment_392470" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-05T12:11:51+00:00" title="October  5, 2012 12:11PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You have a series of encounters/scenes and different ways to link them together.

I can imagine a game where players wish to make "in-character" decisions (i.e. what they think their character would choose, not what's good for the game), wish to play lazy, cowardly characters and yet have them dragged into adventure and conflict. In fact, I think I've played in a few games like that. Under those circumstances, a GM who "railroads" them into certain encounters even though the players are trying to avoid them might be (at the very least) a functional solution. Whether the GM should be open about that is a matter of taste, I think. It does no great harm to be open about it, but some of the players might prefer not to know what is being (or was) railroaded, and what is/was truly a consequence of their choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392533/#Comment_392533" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T07:46:33+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  7:46AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, if I'm about to railroad my players, I also choose what kind of characters that they are allowed to play. I tend to do this when I'm not railroading as well. The only exception is if we play games with collaborate storytelling (Polaris, Zombie Cinema and other games with rotating GM seat).<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be characters that are handed out. I can let the players make most of the decisions, but I will tell them "You are all part of..." or "You must choose one of these goals each".<br/><br/>Why I do this, is because I don't want the little hobbit and the grand dragon master to be in the same party. I don't want the characters to spread to much. Some games takes care of this in a natural way. In Mouse Guard and Shadowrun, for example, it's part of the world.<br/><br/>So if I choose what scenes that the characters end up in, it's going to be logical scenes. Not where the hobbit wakes up as a mass murderer or anything else that breaks the players' views about their character. And if I ever going to make a hobbit-as-a-mass-murderer-scene, I'm going to tell the players about it in beforehand. "Don't invest to much in how your characters are, because they are going to be defined as we play."<br/><br/>It's important to communicate within the group about how to play the game.

Anyway, the last posts seem to indicate some of these were merely forgotten)<br/><br/>-Part of the base of railroading as a problem is that somebody is forcing others to follow an specific creative agenda.<br/>-From that viewpoint, players can also railroad, providing that:<br/>-Railroading is an attitude that can have different durations: one round, a whole scene, a whole session, a campaign, a GM's lifetime, etc.<br/><br/>I've got a few questions to help me get back on the discussion:<br/>-When as a GM you push a creative agenda nicely, knowing your player's tastes, being sensitive to their needs and problems, instilling emotions on them about the story rather than frustration against the flow of the game, etc... is called Rollercoasting, right?<br/>-When you do it wrong and players notice the walls, limits, you taking away their options, imposing poor motivations and reactions on their characters, make them look bad against your own characters... is it called Railroading or I'm just messing the terms?<br/>-What about the Social Contract? just joking, I'm dropping that. I understand the term isn't only not applicable here but also as insulting as "oriental". And here allow me to make a disclaimer: Spanish is my native language, I'm from Peru and here none of those terms have or are used in any negative way. And as long as I have lived here, and as long as I've been exposed to foreign culture I didn't found a single reference that they were used to express such barbaric concepts and insulting ideology.<br/><br/>So well, what I need is a new term to refer to the agreement a group of people make when they get together to play a game. It has nothing to do with friendship, since a few strangers can gather around a table to play a game anytime. It's partly a social convention (social convention is safe to use, right?) because the word "game" everywhere implies that we're not being serious and that this activity is only for fun. (we're talking in normal people levels here, not in SAW sociopaths level). <br/><br/>In the particular case of tabletop RPGs, it starts with comunicating our desire to play a game where we will have the control of a character and made up situations and reactions to those situations. Next we get an agreement on that and an explanation of how. <br/><br/>The rest is the game itself, but this small part where everything begins is the clue to solve the whole problem. Whatever left unsaid in this moment creates assumptions and expectations in the players; so whenever these aren't fulfilled in a satisfying way (whether of not it was the way the player expected) and the discomfort goes too far and deep, we start to point whatever we think is ruining our fun, call it names and yell "Stop doing it!"<br/><br/>-So, what's the name for that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392559/#Comment_392559" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T14:21:56+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  2:21PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2012 2:22PM by Paul_T.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zak S.

Well, roleplaying seems to mean different things for different people. It refers mainly to interpretating a character, which most of the time extends to the choices that character would make. But then again, some GMs confuse pushing a creative agenda with pre-defining which choices that character would take. And so they take that choice away from the players.<br/><br/>Taking something away from the players isn't bad unless you give them something back. That's why things like compelling Aspects work so nicely: the GM is taking player's choices away, but she is giving a promise to make it up whenever they want it, so the players can calm down a bit and appreciate how that hard move from the GM now will make making things more interesting later.<br/><br/>There are many things the GM can give when she takes something away from the players. If the GMs gives enough quality emotional content (which can be the epic sense of a battle, some drama, some glory, a sense of importance, etc) it may be more than enough for some players to not resent being taken something away from them.<br/><br/>The list of things the GM can give back to the players is longer of course; but is just a part of what "managing expectations" means.

Now, if my expectations were about inmersion, the GM would only get to make a rollercoaster if she knew me to the point of being able to predict what would I do in a determined situation and what will actually surprise me in a good way. That's not imppossible but terribly difficult and when it isn't accomplished it reveals the whole plot as illusionism, and the tools used to make it as railroading. So you can safely say that when the players expectations are about inmersion, in a high percentage of the cases you will have better experiencies whenever you don't write a full detailed plot of the whole session, but instead gather a list of scenes, places, characters and all the content players create, start things with a few bangs and improvise from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392679/#Comment_392679" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T02:42:30+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  2:42AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2012 2:51AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>: your argumentation against railroading is all based on how it has been done wrong, and what you prefer; bangs and improvisation. <br/><br/>That is all fine, but you need to see that there are several ways to play a role-playing game. And you need to see that different ways come with different qualities. <br/><br/><i>Railroading</i> is one technique that offer the good game-smith or game-master a whole range of possibilities; it has qualities that has been shown in great examples of actual play, in various threads at this forum the last year.<br/><br/>Railroading done wrong is a matter of <i>bad leadership</i>, not the technique itself. GMs both green and experienced may take to the technique of railroading in a misguided attempt to hide their nervousness in facing the great unknown of free improvisation. The nervousness is understandable, but still; it leads to a lot of bad leadership in role-playing games. <br/><br/>You need to look behind the strata of nervousness and bad leadership, and see the technique of railraoding as is, with the inherent qualities. I did so some years back and came up with a very nice tool to use in some scenarios. I do not use it all the time, but when I use railroading it is to focus attention on certain parts of the interaction. The tools of railroading is very effective in doing that. But to do it right, you need to have an agenda; something you want to focus on.

And you need to see that different ways come with different qualities. <br/><br/><i>Railroading</i> is one technique that offer the good game-smith or game-master a whole range of possibilities; it has qualities that has been shown in great examples of actual play, in various threads at this forum the last year.<br/><br/>Railroading done wrong is a matter of <i>bad leadership</i>, not the technique itself. GMs both green and experienced may take to the technique of railroading in a misguided attempt to hide their nervousness in facing the great unknown of free improvisation. The nervousness is understandable, but still; it leads to a lot of bad leadership in role-playing games. <br/><br/>You need to look behind the strata of nervousness and bad leadership, and see the technique of railraoding as is, with the inherent qualities. I did so some years back and came up with a very nice tool to use in some scenarios. I do not use it all the time, but when I use railroading it is to focus attention on certain parts of the interaction. The tools of railroading is very effective in doing that. But to do it right, you need to have an agenda; something you want to focus on. And then you have to, as always, get all the players on the same boat; make them accept the way the game is led and played; and help them see how their interaction is the hearth of it.<br/><br/>Done right it leads to inspired interaction, deep immersion, and great role-playing. <br/><br/>Have a nice day! </blockquote>\nSeems you totally misunderstood me Thomas, I'm not against railroading, I'm against BAD railroading (or bad leadership as you call it), It's just that either there isn't any agreement about the use of the terms "railroad" and "rollercoaster" or I'm not getting the difference. I thought and wrote before that "Rollercoasting" was when it was done right and "Railroading", when it's done wrong ("right" and "wrong" being here the equivalent of "everybody had fun" vs "we hate that gy and won't play with him anymore").<br/><br/>Anyway my argument tried to get to the core of it: as a GM or a player, you CAN take control of the creative agenda in a way that reduces drastically the choices for the other side, as long as you give something in return. It can be a good narration, something that helps other players get more attached to the story or enjoy it better, it can be the promise that next time the player will be able to take control of the creative agenda (by the use of story points), etc. My apologies if this wasn't understood at all, it could be by my poor choice of words.<br/><br/>Now, your use of the word "leadership" here illustrates me a bit of how you see railroading and how you present the game to the players. You see, it's different to say "I'm going to take you to a world of fantasy" than just "We're going to play a game where you can be whatever you want". In the first case the players will expect the GM to lead, while in the second the players will expect to lead the action wherever they want to. Each one are right in their own playing style. But here comes the problem of miscomunication again: Either the GM said it one way and meant the other or the players are used to one way and didn't paid attention to the difference the GM has made. And so players expectations are crushed in the middle of the game. And then again more bad leadership and worse comunication skills come to make the problem worse, turning the whole game into a wrestle for control. Which sadly some players and GM find fun in itself.<br/><br/>So, railroad, rollercoasting or good leadership whatever you call it, it's ok as long as you're honest to your players, explain what style you'll apply from the start, hope for the best and deal with any issues in the game later with good leadership, your best improvisational skills and your finest sensitivity with the people you're sharing the tabe with. Have a nice day and game you too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17277/being-open-with-railroading-your-players/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17277/being-open-with-railroading-your-players">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17277/being-open-with-railroading-your-players/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17277/being-open-with-railroading-your-players/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17277%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17277%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
