But for some reason I didn't put the names with the PCs and I'm bad about the names with the faces (I could tell you the face and the PC, yes that's just lame...), so this is has a high chance of being wrong, but anyway, I think it was Kingston who played 10, the "paranoid android" who left the Robot Nation in a sex scandal (he likes sex - for a robot, that's the scandal to start with! - and even "sicker," with humans), one of his Issues (the game requires and heavily uses PC "Issues"). But 10 (that's his binary number - one of the very first real AIs) is also a diplomat/manipulator extraordinaire. I'll say Dan played Galactic Mike, the ultimate space-fighting champion, but it could have been Lucian (or I could have the guys all mixed up), anyway, this ultimate champ was a big bruiser and provided more grist for the plot with his Issues of being indebted to the space mafia and his little girl needing an expensive operation. Lucian (maybe) played TK-427 ("Teek"), the modular robot, who easily swaps parts with anything and everything along with having great communications and analysis skills; his Issues included being an obsessive parts-swapper, his modules taking too much power, and falling in love with a human he never met (which provided the hook to the party as it's the human reporter focused on covering Galactic Mike). Teek's love interest issue got him into the same kind of trouble as 10, so they were deported together. Sara played Gina, the knife-fighting metal worker, a major kleptomaniac who was incredibly stubborn; Gina is a major fan of Galactic Mike. I may come back to edit this if I got names wrong, as I have the email addresses and will be in touch with the players anyway to send the beta rules/get any further feedback, but it'll be a few days before I have the time to sit down and do just a few clarity edits and corrections on the mechanical rules brief that I have. Anyway, it was a really fun game, the players used their PCs' Issues and the inherent silliness and power of their characters to interact. I have to admit though that on my end I was too mechanics-obsessed in my in-game thinking, given the nature of this as a beta for me, and I missed a couple opportunities, especially the back story of 10's ancient heritage and either of Gravity Mike's two ancillary Attributes of "likes zero gravity football" and "dislikes monkeys." Especially "dislikes monkeys," normally I use a lot of monkeys in the setting and I basically just got caught up in the other game aspects. On the other hand, the players did great stunts and used their own Issues against themselves to drive events, which should happen but I really appreciated the players' dynamic and creative uses, from Gina stealing things without a care for consequences (narratively, I should have used some later-game consequences, again I was too mechanics-observing) to 10's human porn desires leading to interstellar broadcasted-embarrassment. Everyone said they had a great time and there was tons of laughter at the table (this is how CNP should work, too), but I think I wasn't as creative as the players in this one, and I got some really good feedback, so I feel it worked really well and getting close to even blind playtesting, a few more tweaks but I think now it's finally in the right ballpark. <br/>\n<br/>\nSee also index of my various GPNW game commentaries at http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=147473 ([Go Play NW2008] It's Over! # 26)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KCassidy" title="KCassidy"><img alt="KCassidy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KCassidy">KCassidy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147773/#Comment_147773" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T16:56:49+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  4:56PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that the game is made of awesome.

It's based in some large part on Tony Dowler's Principia as that existed a year ago and the questions he has that players pose in that system.  This is differently played out, but all comes from that notion.  Basically, players takes Actions in a "Chapter" (Chapter = a series of Turns, a Turn = each player takes an Action; a Chapter ends depending a bit on GM and player interaction but at least 3 Turns, without getting into a few nuance rules).  The result of an Action (which is opposed by the other players'/GM's Reactions as appropriate) may lead to Successes, and those Successes must be applied to 1 of 3 categories, you either Damage your opponent (hurting his capabilities and for sub-PC/sub-Nemesis classes possibly removing them entirely), Benefit something/someone (healing or boosting a capability), or add Goal dice, meaning you get to apply dice as Kingston mentions that go towards a Conflict Resolution roll at the end of the Chapter.  The winner of course wins the Conflict, but also gets to name the first Goal, seizing initiative basically, for the next Chapter.  The loser(s) then states their Goal in reaction, in equal magnitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks to Tony for that idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KCassidy" title="KCassidy"><img alt="KCassidy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KCassidy">KCassidy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147824/#Comment_147824" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T20:36:08+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  8:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nerdfighter?

Dan and I are somewhat interchangeable, but in this case you got us right.  Sara and I had a lot of fun in the game, and I was impressed by how easily and quickly a vague character concept became an enjoyable and playable character.  Being able to include Issues as a kind of risky powerup was particularly enjoyable--my only fear is that the downsides were too small, particularly when you get successes *and* KEGs for pulling them in, and the damage could be paid off in KEGs.  Maybe it could damage you plus give the GM plot dice?<br/><br/>At any rate, quite enjoyable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148125/#Comment_148125" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T13:28:37+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  1:28PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the suggestion, I'm still mulling that bit, too.  I'm tending to think though the answer is less in not giving Successes and KEGs but rather having stronger narration in how the PC is set back.  That way, even though you can easily enough undo the damage per se, you still have a struggle on your hands in some way.  I'm thinking of how Kingston's 10, when hit by the "human sex attack", was absorbed and had to work his way out of it via an Action and not just KEGs.  That wasn't his own use in that case, but PCs should probably similarly be affected by those setbacks (relative to the number of Successes on the Issue of course).  But it's only a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut actually, now that I think about it, nickel-and-dime Goal dice for the GM might be the best trade-off.  It would have to be just small enough to keep enticing the player into it (the interaction is fun, too, so should be encouraged), while enough to make the decision not a gimme.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, food for thought, thanks for mentioning it,and thanks for the kind words, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
