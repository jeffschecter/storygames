You find it in works like Homestuck and Dirk Gently (hell, even Seinfeld has elements of it.) It is much like a mystery, in that the chief emotional effect is "meaningful revelations" - the feeling of everything coming together suddenly. However, the main difference from a traditional mystery is that - and this is the important bit - it's told <i>backwards</i>.<br/><br/>In a mystery, you are presented with questions which later on get tied together with answers. In an unmystery, you have answers which later on get tied together with questions. Another way of thinking of it is that mysteries fill in missing knowledge with new information, whereas unmysteries connect together old information.<br/><br/>This is nothing new. A savvy Homestuck reader figured it out before I did. But the genre in and of itself has not had many forays into in the world of RPGs. Are there any games that could handle it? Can you even figure out what the hell I'm talking about?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383376/#Comment_383376" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T21:30:54+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  9:30PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, if I'm not mistaken, that the game Dirty Secrets is at its core this very thing you are describing:<br/><br/><a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/17" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/17</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13415.phtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13415.phtml</a><br/><br/>Does that seem right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383379/#Comment_383379" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T21:50:09+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  9:50PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sssssort of.

In theory, you could hack Fiasco to be played this way, starting with the Aftermath and then jumping back to the first Act.<br/><br/>Edit: And yeah, Dirty Secrets does noir but still emphasizes the solving of an unfolding mystery, as in classical noirs like The Maltese Falcon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383386/#Comment_383386" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T22:11:24+00:00" title="June 25, 2012 10:11PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a question - is a normal mystery presented backwards the same thing as a backwards mystery?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383387/#Comment_383387" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T22:17:08+00:00" title="June 25, 2012 10:17PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, what you're talking about isn't really a normal mystery presented backwards. You're talking about the idea of a gradual epiphany, a transition through what some might term mystic states of awareness.<br/><br/>While most mysteries, thrillers and whodunnits are based, to some degree, on scientific processes (even mysteries set in fantastical universes tend to use analytical deduction and even a little forensics to drive readers/players toward the big reveal at the end) works like Dirk Gently and Homestruck play fast and loose with the rules of reality.<br/><br/>They do, however, maintain an internal, consistent logic. The clues which are being revealed all eventually make sense, even if it is in a it-could-never-be-real kind of way.<br/><br/>This is really gonzo thinking, the kind of thing that lends itself pretty well to quick, light story games that you want to bring out for fun or something at a convention.<br/><br/>All you really have to do is set up some kind of mechanic where players can invent whatever explanation they like if they meet two conditions:<br/><br/>1. They mention something odd that's already been formally established<br/>2. They connect it to another solid fact that's already been formally established.<br/><br/>(Obviously, the rules for formally establishing facts and weird events would be important, too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383394/#Comment_383394" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T23:19:25+00:00" title="June 25, 2012 11:19PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm talking purely about the manner in which information is disseminated.

I'm still trying to nail down what's really so different about this genre. Here's a few potshots:\n<ul>\n<li>Revelations contain no new elements. Epiphanies are just revisitations to or extrapolations on what has already come to light.</li>\n<li>Questions are not the basis of the plotlines, and don't linger. You start knowing what you need to. Questions arise moment-to-moment and are answered immediately after.</li>\n<li>The structure, then, comes from unloading lots of seemingly unrelated elements and slowly connecting them together. The comes a point then that everything starts turning back on itself, and everything is just a recombination of what has already been introduced.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383424/#Comment_383424" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T07:48:05+00:00" title="June 26, 2012  7:48AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you have a series of facts that you know somehow work together but it's not immediately apparent how?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383432/#Comment_383432" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T10:33:47+00:00" title="June 26, 2012 10:33AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, exactly.

What's up with this island? What happened last night. Whereas in the unmystery the audience never asks a question, because they don't suspect that anything unusual is happening. That is, until the end, when a bunch of seeming unconnected events come together.<br/><br/><i>Sienfeld</i> seems like the archetypal example to me. You would have an (a) plot (Kramer buys new golf clubs and practices by driving balls into the ocean) and a (b) plot (George tries to impress his new girlfriend by pretending to be a marine biologist). Hijinks follow, and the audience has no reason to believe these two plots are related until the end of the episode, when George, the not-really-a-marine-biologist, is forced to try to rescue a beached whale and discovers one of Kramer's golf balls lodged in its blowhole. <br/><br/>I've done plots like this as a GM, but it seems like a tricky thing for a game to set out to accomplish, since a huge part of the appeal is the shock of seeing apparently unrelated bits of plot come together. If everyone at the table knows they are playing a game that does that, they might be pleasantly surprised by how the pieces come together, but they're not going to say, "Oh my god, I had no idea!"<br/><br/>I'm not saying that a game like this couldn't work, just that it'd be tricky. Maybe if some of the players had incomplete information? Or if the plots only came together sometimes? I don't know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383667/#Comment_383667" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T19:50:47+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  7:50PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2012 7:53PM by Teataine.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Hangover doesn't fit terribly well because what it does is more or less just telling a story backwards (not literally, but still). The characters wake up with questions and follow the clues to an eventual resolution.<br/><br/>Lost imo fits the Homestuck paradigm because we (almost) never see protagonists actually follow up a mysterious situation, uncovering clues that eventually reveal the answer. Instead, mysterious things just <i>are</i> and it's up to us, the viewers, to figure out their place in the story through flashbacks, sideways flashes, metafictional material (ARGs, webisodes etc.). The characters never figure out what the polar bear is doing on the island. They never go "holy shit, that's a polar bear, let's investigate its presence on the island!". Only the viewer is privy to the polar bear's place in the larger picture, through reference to information the characters never share between themselves so they could form a better understanding.<br/><br/>Similarly in Homestuck, the characters never go "Who is Lord English? Let us find out!". Lord English simply is, his identity is explained as being X. But his complete story, his background, his actual identity as Y, etc. that is all information only the players/readers have, by cross-referencing dozens of casual clues (or pretty overt exposition sequences) scattered through the story. An individual character typically only has one piece of info, ignorant of its significance.<br/><br/>I'm making this a lot more complicated than it is...<br/><br/>The mystery story works like this:<br/>John: My name is John. There is an orange ventriloquist puppet on my bed. I don't know how it came here, who put it there and for what purpose. I will investigate. [many scenes later] Ah, now I know the answer(s) to those questions! <br/>The audience: Oooh, now we see!<br/><br/>The "unmystery" story works more like this:<br/>John: My name is John. There is an orange ventriloquist puppet on my bed. It's my brothers'. He sure likes puppets. [many scenes latter] My name is Dirk, [The Audience: who is this guy?] I sure like puppets! <br/>The audience: Oooh, he's John's bro!<br/><br/>Like Jon said, there's the same emotional payoff (which can be huge) as in a classic mystery story, but the mystery tends not to be the focus of the story, nor is it the character's motivation. It's more like an in-joke, a wink and a nudge to the audience, detached from the often oblivious characters.<br/><br/>It's setting up loads of info as a potentially infinite chekhov's guns to trigger latter revelations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
