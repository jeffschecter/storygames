I'm only about half-way through it, but it's about these dogs modified by a scientist to be intelligent and given prosthetic hands, taught to walk on hind legs, and mechanical voiceboxes.  They were created to be slaves and soldiers, living in an isolated town in Canada that retained the culture of it's original founders from late 19th century Prussia.  In the late 20th century, the dogs eventually revolt, kill their masters, and make their way to New York City where they become wealthy celebrities.<br/><br/>So... probably just because of the name Monster Dogs, I quickly got the idea of retheming Dogs in the Vineyard to use part of this set-up.  I'd probably make it a revised version where the project of the dogs is completely on the founder's original schedule and they are used as an army to overthrow Wilhelm II.<br/>So I'm imagining an alternate history kind of game where Monster Dogs are slaves and soldiers through the German empire, stronger and more intelligent than their human masters, but also bred and trained to be perfectly loyal.  As in DitV, they would be travelling troubleshooters, viewed the the people in the towns with both awe, fear, pity, and disgust.  They would be slaves to their imperial masters, but have authority to deal with problems in the towns.<br/><br/>So... the next question is: what the heck is wrong with me?  I've been having a real thing for retheming games lately.  I mean, I haven't actually TRIED any of these ideas yet, but I've been thinking a lot about it.  I never did this in the past with "traditional" rpgs.  Is this because I cut my rpg teeth on things like Dark Conspiracy, Cyberpunk, and later, the WoD games?  Do I just really need my games to have really bizarre settings so that a western theme or a game about boxers fighting to survive doesn't interest me enough and I have to change them to be about monster dogs and ghosts fighting each other instead?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156970/#Comment_156970" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T12:36:45+00:00" title="July 16, 2008 12:36PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds a lot like the RIFTS hack Dog Boys in the Vineyard to me.
