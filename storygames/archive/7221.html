For example, I can't imagine being able to play Polaris via PbP because the other players, the Mistaken especially, needs to be able to interrupt the Heart's narration.<br/><br/>So are there any games that are really well suited to that kind of play?  So far I only know one that is for sure, A Penny for My Thoughts.  I was in an PbEM playtest and that seemed to work just fine because everyone pretty much takes turns and the points when other players input is required is pretty static and determined by the person doing the current memory.<br/><br/>I'm also thinking with a few tweaks it might be possible to Serial via PbP since the "only" place people have a back and forth kind of direct freeform rping interaction is during the potential victim scenes and it seems like there might be a way to work around that a little, possibly by asking another player to describe some of the problems relating to an obstacle than the current player could narrate how he or she attempts to deal with them.<br/><br/>But even so, that might be a bit tricksy.  Does anyone have any experience with games that worked really well with a minimal number of rules/proceedure changes in a PbP or PbEM format?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160670/#Comment_160670" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T15:00:38+00:00" title="August  4, 2008  3:00PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you know, Polaris works really well.

We attempted to get a PbP game going, but after the set-up scenes, it went nowhere. I'm not entirely sure what happened to the other player, to this day.

I've seen a very convincing and succesful DitV game played PBP where the raises and sees really worked well. My current opinion/position is that one of the best ways to ensure a succesful PBP game is to minimise the number of variables who might just drop out and vanish, ie the number of players. There's something to be said for the forum you used and how player-friendly it is, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160826/#Comment_160826" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T13:06:26+00:00" title="August  5, 2008  1:06PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Best Friends might be really good, too.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160832/#Comment_160832" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T13:13:51+00:00" title="August  5, 2008  1:13PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Best Friends might be really good, too.</blockquote>Hmmm... it's been awhile since I read it.  But resolution-wise isn't it pretty much: You need at least X in stat Y to do this thing.  If you don't have that much, you can push a token to the person you hate for that stat?<br/><br/>I'm sure Guy is right in that it's mostly about the group and set-up and expectations, but I'm still of the belief that a game with fairly minimal back and forth in a single gritty instance, like a conflict will make for a smoother PbP transition.  If a conflict comes up and the play has to roll a die, then the GM rolls, and back and forth like that with very little expect a dice roll in each post, well it seems like that would drag things down quite a bit unless people were posting VERY frequently.<br/><br/>I guess that's one point I should have made clear at the beginning.  I'd like a game that could be done via post when each player only needs to post maybe twice a day and still have the game moving at a relatively good pace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160837/#Comment_160837" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-05T13:21:53+00:00" title="August  5, 2008  1:21PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.... D&amp;D kinda works like that. And quite a few other 'trad' games. I should point out that what I liked in the DitV game that I saw/lurked on was that it worked with the system... after each die/dice was added, the player posted the narrative of it; it just felt like a natural growth of the game. I don't know what it would have been like to play; possibly very slow!<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping momentum consistent and engaging is the key difficulty in PBP, imho. Minimising the number of players I guess is a pretty clumsy way to deal with that difficulty; I've just both played in and run PBP games that began with 6 players and ended up after two weeks having 2-3 players.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still keep thinking that there's some PBP holy grail out there; a few secrets that make for fantastic games.
