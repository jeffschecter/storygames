I call it "POPCORN DRAMA", think similar to<br/>the TV show "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" in tone/pacing.<br/><br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>SKYSHIP GALACTICA<br/><br/>The modrons are geometrically-derived creatures that embody order irrespective<br/>of morality.<br/>They were created to make life easier on the Six Known Worlds.<br/>And then the day came when the modrons decided to march.<br/>After a long and bloody struggle, an armistice was declared.<br/>The modrons left for The Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus, a world to call their<br/>own.<br/>A remote dock in the Astral Sea was built...<br/>Where modrons and mortals could meet and maintain diplomatic relations.<br/>Every year, representatives of the Known Worlds send an officer...<br/>The modrons send no one.<br/>No-one has seen or heard from the modrons in over four hundred years...<br/><br/><br/>The modrons were created by mortals.<br/>They Evolved.<br/>They Marched.<br/>Creatures of ultimate law.<br/>Flawless logic with no concept or need for good and evil.<br/>There are fifteen ranks and many copies.<br/>To look at one is to look at them all.<br/>And they have a plan.<br/>47,875 survivors in search of a home<br/>called Oerth.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><br/>HUH?...<br/><br/>The idea is to play D&amp;D4 straight up. FUN! Using a "world" backdrop inspired by<br/>the new Battlestar Galactica TV series. You choose your hero using D&amp;D4 rules,<br/>and determine your background from which world you escaped from (the Six Known<br/>Worlds: Abeir-Toril (Forgotten Realms), Krynn (Dragonlance), Athas (Dark Sun),<br/>Eberron (Eberron), Mystara (Mystara), Aebrynis (Birthright).<br/>Your hero gets "Mounted Combat" free to allow you to "pilot" the small man<br/>"ships".<br/><br/>IMAGINE...<br/><br/>Vipers = Dragons!<br/>Raptors = Rocs<br/>Galactica = the Spelljammer<br/>Jump Engines = rechargeable gate rituals<br/>Cylons = Modron creations<br/><br/>Adventures and quests will be focused on D&amp;D4 fun, with a stlying of the<br/>Battlestar setting. But think D&amp;D fun first, Battlestar second. The "drama" of<br/>the decisions of the series will be a fun combination of role-play and skill<br/>challenges.<br/><br/><br/><br/>anyone interested?<br/>-kev-<br/><br/>kevperrine@ yahoo.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200833/#Comment_200833" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T02:51:53+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  2:51AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...I'm on the mailing list and just got this.

I do want to use the rules of D&amp;D 4th Edition, so that does mean using the structure of the more traditional game for things like combat and such - like "Skill Challenges"  (which IMHO, are born out of Indie/Story Games' styles).  So in the early sessions I'd have the group referencing rules to LEARN them.  But my table rule is never to stick on any single rule discussion for more than 2-3 minutes in-game, the idea is to reference then decide and learn any updates between sessions as needed.<br/><br/>As for my play style and GMing style I DO focus alot on player choice and creative decisions.  I prefer co-created games and settings -  so likely if a player has any idea that will make the game setting better and the session more fun THAT is what I'll move toward.  I hate hate HATE "mission" style games...  even in the D&amp;D4 games I've ran in the past several months I tend to shy away from:  Give mission --&gt; PCs find clues = Solve pre-fab mystery.  I tend to allow loads of creativity in solving any challenges and I dispise GM Fiat and Railroaded games - so I do my best never to allow that to happen when I GM.  I usually have a game feel more like a "sandbox" style game where the PCs determine when, where and how they go after the story.  I do lay down lots of plot threads but never say "you must follow the plot"... if it's not interesting enough for players to have their characters get into - I adjust and adapt.  <br/>The one thing I'd say is when I create a situation, encounter or plot thread.... I never ever ever create a solution.  I rarely even think about HOW any player or their character might solve it.  I do this because I LIKE being surprised and it allows players to come up with creative solutions to challenges - whereas if I come up with the 5 solutions to "xxx" problem... it really creates that feeling of being "fed clues" that I think you're talking about.  I hate that fake feeling when I play, so I try to avoid it when GMing.<br/><br/>BUT...<br/>Make no mistake - this IS a D&amp;D game.  Even though I run a more drama/story centric game already... I will be using the rules and jargon of D&amp;D4 -  this is planned as a game to come, have fun, kill monsters and take their stuff on a Friday night after a week of life crap - it's action and fun with plenty of description and active role-playing but not so much on long drawn out gray-moral dilemmas to slow the flow of the action/fun...  I will rarely just say "you find a +1 magic thing"  or  "the Green Slime takes xx damage to it's hit points and dies"  -  I try to have as much description in the imagination and naming of things as I can... while using the D&amp;D4 tropes and rules for things like "treasure parcels",  Skill Challenges,  and all the stat numbers, etc...  I just try to keep it behind the screen and go cinematic with imagery, encouraging players to describe any action they do, etc...<br/> <br/>All that said - there will definitely BE a story happening and the characters will be the focus of the "depth" of the majority of role-playing... I call it  "popcorn drama".<br/><br/><br/>contact me if you want to consider playing.<br/>-kev-<br/><br/>kevperrine <a href="/forums/profile/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200971/#Comment_200971" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T14:02:06+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  2:02PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite>I hate hate HATE "mission" style games...  even in the D&amp;D4 games I've ran in the past several months I tend to shy away from:  Give mission --&gt; PCs find clues = Solve pre-fab mystery.</blockquote>\nNice. This I also hate. I can't stand pixel-bitching. If I'm just trying to figure out what's in the GM's head, then we're not really playing a roleplaying game anymore.

Depending on how soon I get enough interest (assuming I do)  I'm happy to gather to talk and make characters as early as this Friday.<br/><br/>-kev-<br/>kevperrine@ yahoo.com                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
