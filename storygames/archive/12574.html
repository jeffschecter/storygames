I'd never really examined one of these things from close up before, and the decorations had all been installed in a way that made one think its original owner must have had a head bursting with narratives about its inhabitants. It got me wondering whether there are any games out there that might be suited to using a doll's house as some sort of prop in an original and more-than-merely-decorative way. Anybody have any ideas about this? Anyone ever actually tried it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282398/#Comment_282398" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T09:39:35+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  9:39AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not a story-game exactly, but it could make a killer [sic] gameboard for Clue, or Kill Dr. Lucky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282487/#Comment_282487" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T13:01:45+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  1:01PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2010 1:21PM by komradebob.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'all make my head hurt when you say things suggesting that physical props are merely decorative in the first place, yez know that?<br/><br/>PTA immediately comes to mind, actually, with different rooms being personal sets.<br/><br/>I'd also think there'd be some inherent suggestion of scene setting/ending/changing tied to the rooms in the dollhouse.<br/><br/>You mentioned the idea that a narrative was suggested, which says to me right off that you could cobble something together that uses Aspect creation as in Fate systems, but going with more than merely physical stuff too.<br/><br/>One good thing about a dollhouse that differs from using other sorts of minis is that fundamentally people interact with them differently than with gaming miniatures, so that is already a bonus in my mind. Several years back when my daughter was younger, I tried cobbling together some more storygamey style stuff using minis and more dollhouse style "terrain". Not having any background with any sort of wargaming, she definitely hit on a more ,e r, natural story making approach to their use. I don't seee any reason adults wouldn't do the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282503/#Comment_282503" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T14:31:22+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  2:31PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm imagining a Fall of the House of Usher sort of setup.<br/><br/>In fact, every idea I've had on the topic involves the eventual destruction of the dollhouse.
