I want the city to feel "alive".<br/>I want the city to feel like a constant NPC that's always there. I want the PC's to have their favorite spots and to know the ins and outs of the city. I really want the players to feel that they are "residents" of the city rather than just passing through.<br/>Besides actual NPC's or locations, are there any helpful in-game methods to make the city itself seem very imposing and labyrinthine?<br/><br/>One of the other daunting tasks I've always encountered in cities is when the players ask about a certain place or shop they want to go to.  Since the campaign will mostly take place in the city, I'm wondering how much of the city I need to detail in advance.  Obviously detailing it "all" would be great but that's:<br/>-  not always practical, to build/list or take time to make<br/>-  works against my weekly creative impulses to build adventures<br/>-  and doesn't add or take any player ideas into account<br/><br/><br/>Many times in games I'll feel like despite supposedly taking place on crowded streets the scenes were always nearly empty aside from our heroes, or at best had a few static figures in the background.<br/><br/>How do you ensure that the players know (and FEEL) that their characters are surrounded by a lot of people, people who are getting on with their own lives. <br/><br/>Some initial ideas...<br/>"Streets can be crowded (or strangely empty, depending on the time of day) and sometimes there will be a scuffle, or a vehicle breaking down and blocking the junction, or any of a hundred other things... none of which have any bearing on the adventure.  The PCs can investigate and get involved if they want to, but not everything you encounter in a city should be a prelude to adventure or part of the current plot. Shops won't always be open and they won't always have the stock you want. There may be licensing laws regarding sale and consumption of alcohol. Local law enforcement should be more than just idiots in uniform who are no match for the characters.<br/>As things progress and the characters build up a reputation then there will be changes. Perhaps they can make an appointment to see the mayor rather than being instantly refused (they may still have to wait, but he'll be pleased to finally meet them). They might even gain enough fame that their very appearance in the street will cause difficulties because of crowds of fans and well-wishers.<br/>The city should have an overall personality.<br/>It's like meeting a person.<br/>At first they may ignore you, but as you get to know them over time their attitude softens and eventually you might become very important to them. The biggest fault I find in many city-based games is that the environment seems to exist solely for the benefit of the PCs. Avoid that and you should be well ahead of things."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Now...<br/>All that said - notes to start with.<br/>What detailed suggestions.<br/>What rule mechanics.<br/>What GM tips and tricks during actual play.<br/><br/>... would you suggest or have ideas to get some of those things across?<br/><br/><br/>Any other great ideas?<br/>thanks!<br/><br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161229/#Comment_161229" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T12:46:42+00:00" title="August  7, 2008 12:46PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kev,<br/>\n  I did this for my old CyberPunk campaign. I think a couple of things that might help:<br/>\n1) Different parts ofthe city should have a different feel. Downtown (or wherever in your city) should be more intense, in the burbs, less so, right?<br/>\n2) Different groups should be found in different areas and act differently in different areas, right?<br/>\n3) Organized crime (in fantasy campaigns, think guilds) is a part of city life. Their power and influence will depend on the setting/theme/part of the city. But it should be a factor, right?<br/>\n4) For certain character archetypes, religion can be a big challenge. In a big city, there will be many religions that have to peacefully co-exist, right? For the character that is a religious zealot (paladins, etc), this can be difficult to reconcile, right?<br/>\n5) Economy - The cost of living should be a lot higher. And different from area to area.<br/>\n6) Society - A city that big is composed of several societies/cultures co-existing and vying for power and influence. Each will all have their own standards of conduct. And will mistrust outsiders. In modern campaigns, this manifests as that stereotypical new york apathy. In fantasy campaigns, this can blow up even so far into actual paranoia towards outsiders...<br/>\n  Well, you get the idea. Hope that helps.<br/>\nDave M<br/>\nMy old site for my old campaign:<br/>\nhttp://www.mvlan.net/~davidm/                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161271/#Comment_161271" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T14:57:17+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  2:57PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that in order to build character attachment to a city, it's perfectly fine to allow them to create locations and characters on the fly. If they say "I want to go to a bar" don't necessarily make up the bar for them. What kind of bar does their character hang out at? What does he drink? What part of town is it in? <br/>If a player says "I go hang out with my friend, the newspaper vendor on the corner" let them make up that character. This is a good way to populate a city and give the PCs ties to it. Obviously, saying that the newspaper vendor is some kind of secret agent may be beyond the pale, though.<br/>Of course, these suggestions assume that the character in question is a native or has lived in the city for some time. If not, you can use the same technique, but twist their expectations so that a "good pickup bar" was actually popular a year ago, but no one goes there now. The newspaper vendor on the corner is friendly with the PC because he constantly pushes for extra purchases from his stand, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161303/#Comment_161303" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T17:51:56+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  5:51PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're using a system that allows you to stat up the city as a character, do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161305/#Comment_161305" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T18:05:52+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  6:05PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin Bow</cite>I think that in order to build character attachment to a city, it's perfectly fine to allow them to create locations and characters on the fly.

I ran a BW mini-campaign earlier this year that took place mostly in an ancient half-destroyed port city decades after an apocalypse.  I felt the pressure of having to come up with color on the fly, and ended up shortchanging that part of the game as I was concentrating on the NPCs and the story.<br/><br/>It would have added a lot to my game to simply ask the players things like, "Okay, you go to your job at police headquarters.  What sort of building it is like?  Is is crowded inside or more orderly?  How do you and your boss get along?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161353/#Comment_161353" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T00:57:13+00:00" title="August  8, 2008 12:57AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fo my Al Amarja game, I used the cards from the CCG On the Edge and handed them out to players as contacts.

Never map it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Use the weather in your description. Sunshine is not imposing. Snow is not imposing. Horrible humidity, drizzle, rain, mist, fog, wind, grey-overcast skys, sleet, slush, dark clouds, rumbling thunder - these are all imposing.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Decorate your city with bad things - prostitutes, burned out cars, broken lights, dark alleys, rats, street gangs, boarded up shops<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Most importantly use the media that we know and love to give the place personality. Start each game with a news broadcast detailing some of the things that have happened in the game world since the last session. This could be just colour or it could be integral to the plot or it could even be a parallel metaphor to the game theme. Maybe you could maintain an out-of-game blog representing the thoughts of a local resident (you) and then have the players contribute to it as different characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Have your players add 'sets' to the setting prior to the start of the game. These can be their personal sets or ones that they would like to see added to the game setting.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Give your city a soundtrack. Select a series of songs that fit the city and give them to your players or give them youtube links etc. Whilst you might not want to play them during the game, it allows the players to get the feel before they arrive at the game. Ditto a film or TV series that really encompasses your city (as long as you make sure that you emphasise to the players that it is the FEEL of the setting rather than the setting wholesale)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161360/#Comment_161360" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T03:46:01+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  3:46AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The city is certainly there solely for the benefit of the players and hence to a certain extent for the benefit of the characters, to the extent that you want the characters to have an interesting interaction with the city.<br><br>I think you should think about what you want this interaction to be. To a large extent this will depend on the kind of game you're running. You might want to focus on the bad things, as suggested above, but that seems to be rather on sided. Suitable perhaps for a cyberpunk game but not necessarily for eveything (have you read Fables?).<br><br>So the city can do different things to the character. Some of these can be general to all characters such as being an exciting place to live with loads of friends and places to go or being alienating with no friends and strange events or the city can be more responsive and reflect the character's internal state of mind or reflect the general state of the world.<br><br>I like the idea of a responsive city and it's something I tried in my d20 Cthulhu campaign. I used a lot of Jungian ideas such as synchronocity. To quote Repoman, "Give you an example; show you what I mean: suppose you're thinkin' about a plate o' shrimp. Suddenly someone'll say, like, "plate," or "shrimp," or "plate  o' shrimp"<br><br>I had a theme of strong women so one of the PCs kept seeing things relating to Wonderwoman. A doll in a shop window, a woman in fancy dress, Linda Carter doing a book signing etc.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161386/#Comment_161386" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T07:04:10+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  7:04AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're doing a modern city in a modern or near-future game, the best thing to do is to use the nearest real city which everyone knows as the basis.  For me, that means setting games in Raleigh or Durham, which unfortunately (because there's no real "one city" here, the "city" is lightly spread out between /3 cities/, so there's little in the way of WoD style Urban feel) isn't super-glamorous, but it is very easy for people to get into the spirit of the game.<br><br>Frex, I did a one-shot of a horror game set in Chapel Hill. The PCs' base of operations was out of the castle-looking building off of Franklin Street. They used real world places and even people to make the city come to life. Best way to make a city come alive? Use a real city.<br><br>Otherwise, yeah, as suggested above, create a small stable of fake places: A restaurant/hangout; a base; a house or two; a neutral area. Give them brief details, and fill them out as you go along. What you'll notice is that places will become like NPCs: Instead of going to meet a new tavernkeeper in town each time the PCs want to drink, they tend to become attached to a particular barkeep. The same goes for places: The players will often narrate revisiting places they've been before, and in the process fill them out that much more, bringing them to life that much more.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
