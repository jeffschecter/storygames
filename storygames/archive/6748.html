Why do D&amp;D repeatedly produce substandard gameplay?<br/><br/>It took me some years, and some game-sessions, but the conclusion is simple; <b>the game itself is flawed.</b> It is an anachronism. The game is full of tidbits that don't connect. The GM is hard pressed to make good gaming out of it, and very often she will not succeed. The game is too rules heavy to translate into effective gameplay, without serious tweaking on the part of the GM. Most of that tweaking is the GM shouldering the responsibility of the game-smiths. Why should we expect the GM to rebuild the rules made by professional game-smiths? They are the professionals, and she is the amateur! Why?<br/><br/>Nothing <i><b>personal </b></i>about it, really, other than the fact that I resent thousands of players being robbed the best chance to experience great gameplay. I know for a fact that thousands of D&amp;D-players have sessions full of frustration due to the flaws of this game. As there are a lot of D&amp;D-players, that makes for a lot of frustration.<br/><br/>Please, all you wizards out there; give them a GOOD edition of the game!<br/><br/>Or please help me convince them that other RPGs may give them a better chance of having THAT GREAT RPG-FEELING THEY ONCE HAD!

I mean, I'm hardly a D&amp;D; cheer leader.  I thought 3.5 was so far beyond anything I'd ever even want to play that after some experience with 3.0 I never had any desire to play 3.5.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.0 is so beyond different that I'm litterally chomping at the bit to play it.  Yet you have been steadfast in your refusal to even acknowledge the possibility.  You ask for the "wizards" to give us a good edition of the game.  They have.  You won't even try to take a look at it with an open mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's ok...to each their own...but you asked in another thread if people would be willing to pay money for a seminar on gaming from you...honestly your approach to D&amp;D; over several threads makes me less inclined to be willing to do so.  Not because I'm some die hard fanboy of the game...but because it indicates a hole in your thinking that, to me, makes you less credible as a lecturer on the topic of game design.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to hear your thoughts about how the volume of rules impact the feel of play and the nature of player relationships around the table.  But not couched in the context of "too many rules equals flawed game".  That's way too simplistic an approach.  Games with a great number of rules definitely impact the "power structure" (for lack of a better phrase) between the players...but not in a binary good/bad fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\n...for what its worth...<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149795/#Comment_149795" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T14:52:46+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  2:52PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>It took me some years, and some game-sessions, but the conclusion is simple; <b>the game itself is flawed.</b> It is an anachronism.

As ever you are a level-headed writer. I appreciate that.<br/><br/>It is a problem that so many people get so provoked every time anyone criticize this game. There is way too many supporters of this game talking about "popularity" when you criticize it, and proclaiming that you are ridden by "personal problems" if you stand by your point of view. I have tested all earlier editions of this game, and found it tame. I've seen lots and lots of frustration on the web, and when meeting people at conventions, pertaining to this game.<br/><br/>Do you really expect me to take "this is played by lots of people" to be a valid argument? If anything, it is an argument for criticizing this game even harder. Why not discuss the frustrations and sublevel gameplay as a real problem of the game? You may take this at face value: <i>The game is too rules heavy to translate into effective gameplay, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without serious tweaking on the part of the GM</span></i>. It goes a long way of explaining why so many groups, with great GMs, have had great experiences with D&amp;D. I'm not saying they didn't. YES, they did!<br/><br/>However: I point out that too many groups have had bad or dwindling experiences with the game. "Dwindling" due to the fact that when the novelty of RPGing wears off, the game very often don't hold up. It ends up serving the players a dysfunctional gaming-experience. I believe, in spite of the popularity, that this game could have had an even greater following, if it had been better at serving up its players.<br/><br/>It could be interesting to discuss that in a serious manner. I would sincerely like to see D&amp;D-supporters take responsibility on this level, showing some solidarity with D&amp;D-players not so fortunate to have a GM that magics gold out of the rules-bog. I do not see how all the HUZZA is helping the game or the players in any way. The only part helped by this kind of craze, is the company. In the long run though, I believe the company would be better off if held to higher standards of design.<br/><br/>It may be, although the first serious reports I've read seem to indicate otherwise, that the 4E is a real improvement. If it is, that would really gladden me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149804/#Comment_149804" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T15:18:12+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  3:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thomas,<br/><br/>I'm a little confused on what you mean by "game play."

For example, stuff like this:\n<blockquote>The game is full of tidbits that don't connect. The GM is hard pressed to make good gaming out of it... The game is too rules heavy to translate into effective gameplay, without serious tweaking on the part of the GM.</blockquote>\nThose are specifically the kinds of complaints that are addressed by 4e. The arguments people make about 4e are often things like "The rules aren't complex enough to simulate the game world", "It's too difficult to tinker with the mechanics", etc. A lot of people <i>hate</i> the stuff they changed to address complaints like yours. I guess I'm just curious your opinion about that ("I don't believe you" is a perfectly acceptable answer, I won't be offended.)<br/><br/>IAlso, f you've looked at the new edition, would your opinion change if it was not called Dungeons &amp; Dragons?

I claim that it takes a smart GM to make it flow, and an even smarter one to make it fly, due to the game being so rules-heavy. Compared to other classical games I know, this game seem to produce way too many lame game-sessions.<br/><br/>As for the new edition, I will talk with my game-designer friends here in Norway on it, as they are purposing to play a 4E-D&amp;D-campaign. I reckon they will give me a level-headed and sound evaluation of the game. I look forward to that. I feel no need to participate though. D&amp;D don't interest me as a game any more, only as a popular phenomenon, and as a server of premises for the gameplay of thousands of players.

(or never had)</blockquote>\nThe first trick is to not tell people that the game they enjoy is flawed. That despite their experience to the contrary, it produces bad games. No matter how many anecdotes you can tell about people you've talked with, played with at cons, or experiences that you've had, they'll never trump the personal experience of thse who enjoy it. I used to be like you. And I hate D&amp;D 3rd edition or AD&amp;D either edition. Although I'm excited about 4th edition, and still have fond memories of basic D&amp;D, I'm not a D&amp;D fan. I think its label as a roleplaying game is questionable. But stop telling people their game is broken.<br/><br/>How do I convince people that other RPGs might give them some fun? I play with them. If they are playing D&amp;D, so be it. As long as it's not some unending campaign where one person will be GM forever, I'll have a chance after some number of sessions to say, "I'll run something". I'll have learned what they like, what they don't. Most importantly, I might discover that we just don't mesh well and we'll part ways. But I'll try to have fun. I'll try to make friends. Those two things are my bigger goal. My goal isn't to get them to stop playing D&amp;D. It's only partially to get them to see other games. My goal is to find more people to play games with.<br/><br/>But stop being that guy. Stop being that guy that thinks he knows what is fun for everyone else. Stop being that guy who tells people their fun is wrong. Being a force of negativity will only strengthen people's negativity. People who agree without will shout "Yeah, he's right! D&amp;D sucks!" People who disagree will go "Wow, he's wrong. He sucks!" And people with a broad perspective will say, "Wow, he's angry and bitter. That sucks." It's all negative.<br/><br/>Instead, be that guy that knows what is fun for himself. Be that guy that tells people what he finds fun. Be a force of positivity. Make people go "Man, that guy's having fun. And that's awesome!" And if that never happens with D&amp;D, fine. You don't need to tell us. If that always happens with some other games, that's great. Tell us about it.<br/><br/>I think you have a mistaken impression that Story Games is about indie games vs traditional. But its really about having fun. And fun isn't defined by rules. Its by how you play the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149851/#Comment_149851" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T17:06:21+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  5:06PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I wasn't trying to be all pedantic about wording with Tomas just to be annoying; I had a feeling that we might actually agree on some points but I couldn't tell yet.<br/><br/>Now I'm pretty sure that I dislike 3.x for a lot of the same reasons you do, so hey, communication is awesome.:)<br/><br/>As far as the opinion vs. objective truth thing, I'm sure I still do that sometimes and don't notice.Not to mention my wife; when she says things like "People should <i>not</i> drive while they're on the damn phone", there's this little vein that pops up that tells me she is actually trying to will the universe into obeying her beliefs.

The manager before I started working there was crappy, always telling kids buying D&amp;D books how much the game sucks... in fact he was always saying how much all the books sucked. I remember asking him about burning wheel and the first words out of his mouth weren't, "oh its fun you should give it a try." but "Oh its totally broken, the combat takes too long and its too complex." <br/>\nIt was no wonder that we barely cleared 400 dollars a week. I used to browse the shelves for hard to find stuff and I'd catch some 12 year old asking him about this or that game. After they'd talked with him you could see them and they were totally deflated and sad. And for what? So he could feel superior... to a 12 year old? After he left, we began to organise play and evangelise all of the games we sold. If we didn't like a game it was, Oh Im not a fan but a lot of people who play here on Wednesdays are. We might make suggestions,... if you like D&amp;D you might think Gemini is fun, or Warhammer FRP. It was hugely succesful, and we went from 400 a week to a couple of thousand. Now there were one or two other things that contributed, but making people feel like their tastes mattered helped a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo seriously, I get that you dont like D&amp;D but your not getting anywhere with your "the game is totally flawed and everyone who plays it is delusional rant" <br/>\nI'll buy I don't like it. I'll buy its more complicated than it should be. But I wont buy no one ever has a good time with it because its the worst game ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've had fun with D&amp;D, and played in many fun games, Ive also played in a few bad ones. But I've also played some pretty stupid games of Vampire... which I will add has a rule zero right in the text of every white wolf game and some great games of Hackmaster which is like D&amp;D on crack and steroids with a side of heroin and curly fries (actually I was a tournament GM at Origins) <br/>\n<br/>\nI've had fun with all of them and been burned by all of them.

So it's non destructive.<br/><br/>Peoples responces here seem to be along the lines of <b>'I don't have a problem. Therefore I should jump in a thread about a problem I don't have'</b>. It's rather odd. It also gives the impression they do have a problem, but the logic is: when there's a problem, people talk about it. So therefore, if you stop people talking, there is no problem. The problem only exists in as much as people talk about it.<br/><br/>Of course, problems can exist even when no one talks about it.

I believe that the real problem with D&amp;D is that it tries to be every game for all people. Not in the ruleset (at least not in the las 2.5 editions), but in actual play. Thus, the reasons D&amp;D seems flawed are historical, not formal. You have people that play D&amp;D because it's the only game they know, or because it's the only game their friends would play, not because it's the best game for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_149938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149938/#Comment_149938" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T00:50:20+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 12:50AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are pointing at some of the problem here, elmago. Nice of you to participate.<br/><br/>I know for a fact that some players are in that situation; playing the game as the only one there is, or playing the game due to peer pressure. Some of them would naturally seek to make their gameplay into something D&amp;D is not. To be told by the game (at least in earlier editions) that "anything may happen" makes it easier to believe in some illusion of interactive freedom. Hack'n slash is great in it's way, but for most people it is plain stupid, and for a lot of players it lose its magic after a while. then comes the phase when they try to patch the game, to do things like intrigue or peaceful conflict-resolution, or realistic cultures, or whatever they perceive could be really cool to interact on. And then they run into tons of frustration, awakening the wrath of co-players, awakening the sleeping limitations of the game itself, and generally making a mess of it.<br/><br/>I dare say that almost any classical RPG out there have better possibilities for diverse gameplay and thematics than D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I am criticizing D&amp;D for the way it tries to make roleplaying. Some players are in love with that way of doing it. The reasons for their love are manifold, and I would be stupid not to believe some great gaming-experiences to be at the hearth of it. Still I maintain that the game itself has great flaws. The largely unspoken limitations of the game is one. To call it a "roleplaying game", when it is more and more like a boardgame, is another one, creating expectations the game never can justify. But the multitude of rules, and exceptions to rules, is by far the worse, in my view. All these flaws makes the game produce crappy gameplay far too often.<br/><br/>As far as I have discerned by the writings on 4E, it too seem to be ridden with rules and rules-exceptions in abundance. What I consider ridiculously heavy patching is already at play, both in this forum and others. It leaves me with the impression that the game has kept its drama-crushing behemothness. If my impression turns out to be right, it actually makes me sad. So lets hope for a better (fantasy)world, in sympathy with thousands of players out there.<br/><br/><br/><b>Sidenote 1:</b><br/>I am under the impression that D&amp;D has an even more dominating position in the US than in other roleplaying countries. Is that correct? Are other games being played over there? (not talking indie games here, but mainstream classical RPGs)<br/><br/><b>Sidenote 2:</b><br/>I believe D&amp;D does a "great" job of frightening people from taking up roleplaying. The dominating position of this one game, makes a lot of people believe that roleplaying is a silly combat-fantasy had by dumb boys. Discussing games in forums like this, we often loose sight of what RPGs really are: a fringe-activity in the society. I believe dialogue-based roleplaying could engage far more people, if they had the chance to see other games than D&amp;D on the scene. Sad fact, in my view. If you think this makes me "hate" the game, you are wrong, but it makes me strive both to lessen the import of this game, and to hold out other games for people to play. In the long term RPGs in general will be better off without the monopoly-like dominance of D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_149941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149941/#Comment_149941" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T01:20:54+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  1:20AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 1:23AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had my say here now.

To be perfectly honest, starting a thread and then avoiding understanding and dismissing the points of others strikes me as a tad disingenuous.  Did you really want to discuss this or just preach about it?<br/><br/>You said that<br/> - the game is flawed<br/> - it needs to be changed in order to produce good game play<br/> - but you're not talking about those for whom it works.<br/><br/>So you've preemptively dismissed any evidence to the contrary of your position.  How convenient.<br/><br/>If you didn't do that you'd see that:<br/><br/>1) People play D&amp;D with the rules as written.<br/>2) They enjoy it.<br/><br/>So the game is accomplishing its design goals and produces the type of play intended in it's design.  Thus it is not flawed.<br/><br/>And talking about it in terms of people who need to be rescued from it totally is trying to tell other people what their fun should be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149953/#Comment_149953" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T04:57:05+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  4:57AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 7:17AM by Marco.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alas, it looks as if Thomas is going to fall <i>just short</i> of completing the standard line of argument here (that all those people who 'enjoy' D&amp;D are either mouth-breathers or deluded ... or both). But for those who've come recently to the Story-Games community, this thread is almost like a performance-art rendition of the worst parts of indie-scene in 2005 and before (not that it's changed entirely: there are some who are still behaving in that fashion).<br/><br/>For people taking notes: there are two basic dysfunctional trends in the RPG-theory dialog and this thread beautifully illustrates both of them.<br/><b>1. Superiority or "I game better than you"</b> (where "you" is the traditional gamer--or maybe just the D&amp;D gamer)<br/><b>2. Victimization or "I was (or, in some formulations, "people are") <i>injured</i> by traditional game text"</b><br/><br/>Here we see both! Fabula (et. al) are just objectively better games--it's a statement of fact! I have seen indie games compared to a Ferrari while traditional games were a Honda civic (and the poster with a straight face expected me to believe he was not saying indie games were <i>better</i>--the Honda was ... more reliable!).<br/><br/>The real drama, however, is in victimization. Even without claiming that the games fundamentally damage the player, we can see here that people--traditional people--need to be saved from them. In this case the indie theorist / game designer is freakin' public servant!<br/><br/><b>Where Does This Usually Go?</b><br/>These formulations have a single basic problem: the 'bad games' tend to be much more popular than the 'good games.' Occam's Razor suggests that if something reliably created a dysfunctional environment and caused misery and strife that it wouldn't spread--that superior products could replace it--and that it would be widely recognized as a bad thing. I am sure there will be posters here who will be able to enumerate at length why some game or other is better than the mainstream comparisons. Things like network effects, an early head start, and difficulty in advertising will be cited. Clearly the big-break in RPG marketing is just around the corner waiting to explode. In this mind-set there's no such thing as a "mainstream RPG" because the mainstream doesn't play it ... yet!<br/><br/>But all of that's dull (and, you know, not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">overly</span> objectionable). The chocolaty-goodness comes when the dysfunctional theorist decides that the masses who play do so <i>because they are inferior</i>--or victims (see above). <br/><br/>There are three major trends:<br/>1. People continue to play D&amp;D because they are <i>hooked</i>. D&amp;D players return again and again to a dysfunctional environment because the experience is (perhaps literally, depending on who is talking) <i>addictive</i>. They get a "glimpse" of what gaming can be and then, by the same psychological mechanism that makes slot-machines so enticing, they keep coming back, chasing the dream!<br/>2. The people do not even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">actually enjoy the game at all</span>. Reports to the contrary are self-justification and rationalization (like, and oh man, I've actually seen this, a woman in an abusive <br/>marriage). These people delusionally make up stories after the fact to re-create an enjoyable game that never happened (I'm reminded of the memory-implant vacations from Total Recall).<br/>3. Some large amount of people like inferior things ... because <i>they are inferior</i>! Look at McDonalds and Top-40 hits! How <i>else</i> could you explain them? Hey? Hello? NASCAR? C'mon people--aren't we <i>better</i> than <i>that</i>?<br/><br/>I have to honestly say I'm very happy to see that this approach isn't getting traction here. That makes it more comedy than really problematic. Maybe it's a sign of how much things have changed since 2005. I also need to add for the record that I'm aware that (a) people do have profoundly negative experiences with some RPGs and I'm not minimizing the hurt there (I don't think it's correct or healthy, however, to blame external, non-acting agencies like rule-books for continuing self-destructive behavior). Also that (b) there are plenty of RPGs with a lot of room for improvement (including your favorite one, unless it is <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> which, in its present edition is clearly the tightest RPG ever written ... if you think I am being anything more than slightly hyperbolic, you are mistaken!). <br/><br/>But this thread--these posts--are everything I could ask for illustrating toxic RPG dialog so I've got to take my hat off to Thomas for giving us this thread.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149964/#Comment_149964" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T06:05:02+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  6:05AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>Please, all you wizards out there; give them a GOOD edition of the game!</blockquote>\nHave you read 4e?<br/><br/>It might not be your cup of tea but I played it last night and it was fun.

I recognize many of Thomas' arguments, about the way D&amp;D is "inferior" for everybody (even if somebody could like it for some reason), because it's roll-playing, because is a hodge-podge of rules, because you play it to "win" and "get points and levels" instead of the way you should play a rpg... I recognize them because I remember saying (and hearing, really, from almost EVERYBODY) very similar things in the post-Vampire world of gaming discussion, in the middle '90.<br/><br/>Maybe is a continental divide? In the USA this didn't happen? Only in Europe? I don't know, but I don't believe so. I think instead that resistance to the Forge tint a lot memories of pre-forge game theory as if seen from rose-colored glasses, a never-never-land where everybody played together in harmony, the Word of Darkness and D&amp;D players drinking from the same stream, joined by the GURPS player and by the fan of Theatrix, hand in hand.<br/><br/>If the forge theory (and, before that, the threefold) were "revolutionary", it was because they negated what until then was a given: that there was a single "good way" to roleplay, and that real roleplayers (distinct from the unwashed masses) didn't play D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I really can't express my outrage at the time, when I first read a little of the Forge in 2002, when I discovered that these people considered D&amp;D a true rpg! It made me almost dismiss anything they could say =:-I<br/><br/>The bigger part of the players played D&amp;D, even here. Even in the newsgroup. But they were the "unwashed masses" to be taught "real roleplaying" (and it didn't help that the most noticeable defenders of D&amp;D were very much against not only game theory but even against any form of rational thinking. I understand now that during these discussions I came to associate their behavior with the entire category of D&amp;D players...).

I do think saying that D&amp;D; is broken and it robs players of good game experiences <u>is</u> crap. But its crap because its so overstated, not because it doesnt have a grain of truth. Sure some D&amp;D; games end up being a fundamentally different game than they are advertised to be, sure sometimes people get railroaded, these things are true. But are they true all the time? I dont think so, and my personal experience has not borne out the D&amp;D; is horribly flawed thesis. A little flawed? You bet! Nuanced? Yep! Impossible to have fun playing?
