It is, however, really hard to find good art that sells what the spacecraft should look like. There's precious little out there on the net where the spaceships aren't made to look like airplanes or sea vessels. I want to show my players that practical, physics-minded space-faring craft can be sexy too.<br/><br/>Well, I had the pleasure last night of talking to two filmmakers at my FLGS. They are developing a sci-fi movie with some heavy attention paid to actual science. Sure they take some liberties for the purposes of entertainment, but they're actually talking to JPL and actual astronauts to get a good idea of how space travel and planetary exploration should look.<br/><br/>As a fund-raising effort for the movie's development, they have produced an illustrated version of their screenplay adorned with their story-board and concept art. The result is practically a technical readout that displays some really cool looking vehicles with Diaspora-like sensibilities.<br/><br/>Their website has some of the illustrations and more information on the book and the potential movie. <br/><br/><a href="http://slingshot2100.com/" rel="nofollow">http://slingshot2100.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245090/#Comment_245090" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T08:45:15+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  8:45AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I met these guys at a local comic con a couple months ago.

So if you arrive at a planet with no established interface infrastructure, you can still transport your cargo even if you have to do it one pod at a time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245184/#Comment_245184" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T16:18:53+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  4:18PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/126502main_iss_assembly_lf1.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245197/#Comment_245197" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T19:26:18+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  7:26PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2009 7:26PM by JuddG.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Dream Pod 9 game <a href="http://dp9.com/Worlds/jc.htm" rel="nofollow">Jovian Chronicles</a> has a number of ship art books that are low-rules, but big on art and maps and such of various ships made in the hard sci-fi style.

The people are all anthropomorphic animals from a single planet that 'woke up' 400 years earlier as a multi-species society with interplanetary travel and A.I.s, and enough biotech to know they didn't evolve on the planet they found themselves. They eventually develop ftl travel (really the only non-real science part of the setting) and expand outward. Now they are on the verge of a war - the core worlds against a consortium of rabbit-only colonies with other rim colonies in the middle. The discovery of an ancient human spaceship hints at the common origin of the various anthropomorphic races. (Their DNA is all 95% human.)<br/><br/>True spaceships are up-is-the-direction-of-travel and never land. Zero-g when the engines are turned off. They look like giant tampon applicators.<br/><br/>Small space stations are zero-g, large ones fractional to 1-g with rotating sections.<br/><br/>Orbital shuttles and surface-to-surface interplanetary craft are boxy/wedge shaped and have airplane-like layouts with ladders for when the floors and ceiling became walls. In atmosphere the fusion rockets become fusion jets which are ducted for vertical landings.<br/><br/>Commercial vehicles use fusion rockets thrusting a up to 1g for half the trip, flip around and decelerate for the second half. <br/><br/>Military vehicles can do 2+ gees if in a hurry, and 5 or more for very short evasive bursts.<br/><br/>Space weapons were hypervelocity self-guided missiles. ACVs = Autonomous Combat Vehicles. No beam weapons.<br/><br/>All fusion reactors and rockets used normal liquid hydrogen, so they had really compact proton + proton fusion tech. <br/><br/>They also had a hand-wavy way of dumping fusion reactor heat with the rocket exhaust, so they didn't need huge radiator fins.<br/><br/>Interstellar travel was elegant. Thrust in the direction of the target star until you are roughly the distance of Saturn from the sun (closer for smaller stars, farther for larger stars - the determination was how "flat" the local gravity well was) Turn on the jump drive and instantly appear a similar distance from the target star. Flip over and decelerate to the inner system planet you are going to. So 1-2 weeks accelerating out, instantaneous jump, and 1-2 weeks decelerating in. Cool thing is you can always tell where someone in coming from or where they are going. <br/><br/>They didn't seem to use any terraforming technologies. There just seemed to be lots of habitable worlds out there. Can't remember how far ships could jump safely.<br/><br/>There were two editions of the original rpg, with a ships supplement for the first one, including modular deck layouts for 'true' spaceships, and cutaways for shuttles. I haven't looked at Sanguine's current Albedo rpg. Art from the comics can be found with Google searches. I'm sure the original comics and collections are on Ebay.<br/><br/><br/>Damn, now I want to play! Could definitely use Diaspora for this...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

They would have to spin very fast and, worse, because the radius is so small, there would be very steep differences in gravity between your chin and your ears. Generally you're looking for a spin radius of a hundred or more meters. This is solved by assuming the picture above is the "under thrust" configuration and that the habitation modules pop loose on cables a few hundred meters long for spin while not under thrust. That seems cooler to me -- because there's prep time (or consequences!) before thrust, there are things to go wrong and game stories to be had.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing is that it lacks a heat exchange system, but again that can (and probably needs to) be folded away out of sight while under thrust.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be cool to see the Leonov rendered for "on station" work, with habitat and heat exchangers full deployed. It would change from a bullet to a spiderweb, suddenly mostly empty space, with the spindle of the hull at the center.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
