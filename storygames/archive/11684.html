Like <i>Passions of the Tide</i>, it was originally designed for d20 during the height of the d20 craze, but I think it'd probably be better served by a new system, one that's directed more toward the sort of play I'm about to describe.<br/><br/>Basically the campaign would be two games played parallel to each other in the district called Fish-End in a decrepit seaside city.  The technology and culture was a bit more Elizabethan than medieval the focus was on thieving and general skullduggery and less on traditional adventuring.  I had a basic framework for a close-ended campaign in which the characters would become embroiled in the machinations of a wizard \u2014 an evil wizard, naturally \u2014 and his allies, a colony of Moon Rats.<br/><br/>This portion of the campaign is human- and rogue-centric, but there's another side to it: mice.<br/><br/>While the humans contend with the wizardly portion of the story, the mice of Fish-End are faced with trouble from the Moon Rats, who have an agenda of their own.  This portion is a bit more adventure-y, because common things among humans become massive and scary on the mouse scale.  The Moon Rats are the primary enemy here, but there are a lot of hazards for mice in the big city.<br/><br/>The idea here is that the human portion is half the story while the mouse portion is the other half, with the stories for each feeding into one another.<br/><br/>So... what to use?  The first and most obvious contender would be <i>Mouse Guard</i>, though I'll confess I haven't finished reading the thing.  Would it be possible to use the same system for humans?  The mice are essentially treated like people, so could you pretend to matters of scale?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260892/#Comment_260892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T07:09:22+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  7:09AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2010 7:10AM by FigureFour.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I was going to suggest Mouse Guard and/or Burning Wheel.<br/><br/>The human game sounds very Burning Wheel to me and, as you said, Mouse Guard is the obvious choice for anthropomorphic mouse adventures.<br/><br/>You COULD run the human side with Mouse Guard as well, which would give you a much simpler mechanical situation overall, but Mouse Guard doesn't have as much support for wizardry. Although, if the only wizard is your NPC you could just fake it.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh, and you could also run the whole thing with Burning Wheel. The Roden lifepaths should cover mice without too much hacking, but that would still be more work for the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261172/#Comment_261172" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T09:00:43+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  9:00AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess it could be possible to just use Human lifepaths for the mice and use the excuse that their cultures are paralleled and therefore interchangeable at the game level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
