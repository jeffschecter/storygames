I thought I'd reproduce it here in case anyone was interested. It might raise some interesting discussion. Parts of it might appear to be of the granny + eggs = teaching to suck variety, so apologies for that. Some of you may have heard this tale before, but for those who haven't, here's a cautionary tale of woe regarding the games publishing business.<br/><br/>A few years ago, myself and Paul (Bourne) were happily working away on a website for a free game setting. It was called a|state. Paul did the art, I did the words, some people liked it, happiness ensues. Now, one evening, after a particularly glowing round of online praise and bloated with ambition, we thought "I wonder if we could publish this?"<br/><br/>Cue months and months of hard slog, dragging poor old John Wilson into the fray (his patience truly does know no limit), and we get close to what might be termed a complete game. We allow ourselves a brief moment of rejoicing. As an aside, it was during this lengthy process of writing, artworking and finding out how the hell we went about actually creating a published game, that (while at Conpulsion in Edinburgh) Paul and I meet a bloke in a trenchcoat who shakes our hands and wishes us all the best of luck with our project. He was very pleasant and enthusiastic. "Gosh" we thought after he had wandered away "What a nice bloke." His name was Gregor Hutton.<br/><br/>We even travelled down to London at the kind invitation of James Wallis to pick his rains over lunch and numerous coffees. His advice and wisdom was invaluable. I still adhere to many of the snippets of publishing advice that he gave that day.<br/><br/>Now, we were young(ish) and foolish back then. The way you published a game (according to accepted wisdom) was to produce a big hardback (or softback) and sell it through three tier distribution. Ok, here's a bit about what that is:<br/><br/>If you are a small publisher, the big distributors (especially in the US, Esdevium over here are somewhat more accomodating) will not touch you with a ten foot pole. You have to go through a fulfillment house. What the fulfillment house does is collate the product of numerous small publishers and sell it on to the distributors. Then, the distributors sell stuff to individual games shops, who sell it to you, the eager customer. This is three tier system in a nutshell. Sounds good, yes? No. See, a distributor will pay about 40% of cover price for your book, perhaps a tadge less if they buy in big quantities. Now, because the fulfillment house do you a service by marketing your stuff to distributors, they take a cut of what you get. Generally, the fulfillment people will take 15 - 20% of that 40%. And they want you to pay for shipping to the distributors. When all that is done, you're probably likely to get about 30% of your cover price back. Out of this, you've got to pay for printing, artworking, materials, shipping (to the fulfillment house) and all the other stuff required to actually make a book. Isn't this sounding less appealing all the time?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107305/#Comment_107305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T17:35:01+00:00" title="November  7, 2007  5:35PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, back on track.<br/><br/>We decided to print just over 1000 copies of a|state through a huge Canadian printing company called Transcontinental. Now, to be fair, Transcon were great and have no horrific part in this tale of gloom. We had contracted with a fulfillment house called Osseum Entertainment, who were highly recommended and on the ball. And things went well. Distributors bought a|state. Lots of it. So much so, that Osseum advised we do another print run. We did so. Hell, we had a supplement printed as well. But remember, we're only getting 30% (roughly) of the cover price here. Our margins were more slender than Kate Moss with bulimia. At this point we should have realised that there might be other ways of conducting business. We didn't.<br/><br/>Can you tell things are going to start going wrong soon?<br/><br/>a|state was nominated for the ENnies in 2004 and, in a fit of excitement, I flew to Gen Con. OK, so we didn't win, but it was great. And the Osseum guys put me up in lavish style. They were fun, sensible and seemed to have really solid business heads on their shoulders. I came back full of glowing praise for them. All was well.<br/><br/>The the monthly payments stopped arriving.<br/><br/>Then we didn't get regular spreadsheets and stock updates.<br/><br/>The all communication dies.<br/><br/>Nothing.<br/><br/>Zip.<br/><br/>Uh oh.<br/><br/>The short version of things is that the downturn in the D20 market hit Osseum badly. Real badly. The guy in charge freaked and became something of a paranoid shut-in. Communication was zero, they owed us several thousand dollars in back payments and they had most of our stock in some warehouse somewhere in Back of Beyond, USA. Brown trouser moment? You are not kidding.<br/><br/>Months went by, nothing. Then other publishers whom went through Osseum start talking about things online. Turns out everyone is getting stiffed, nobody can get in touch with the company and nobody is getting any money. The guy who runs the company turns out to be suicidal (this is not anecdotal, I actually spoke to him, albeit briefly) and off his head. <br/><br/>The upshot of all this? No money. Luckily, we got in touch with the warehouse and secured all of our extant stock. Luckily, we got in touch with other means of distribution. Luckily, we adopted a new and much better strategy that meant we weren't going through three tier. Indie Press Revolution were fantastic from day one. Key 20 helped us out in the beginning. Things, after a black period, looked up. Cold City was a bit of a success and help pull us out of the hole we were in. <br/><br/>Looking back, we can give a wry smile about it now, but going through the three tier system just isn't viable for guys like us. Hell, even without the Osseum Debacle, we were only just scraping by. How are things now? Much, much better. The way we do business now is great: I can't praise IPR enough. I can't praise the mutualistic efforts of the small press community (particular the Collective Endeavour and the IPR/Forge booth) enough.<br/><br/>So that's my horror story. How the three tier system and someone taking a mental turn just about killed all our dreams of publishing games. If nothing else, it was a learning experience. I certainly took a lot from it. And it's why I will never, ever recommend anyone following the same path if they are publishing a game. What is happening now in the small press scene is great: we share advice, we help each other out, there is mutualism of the best kind. <br/><br/>If you have any questions or comments, please do fire away.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peteramthor" title="peteramthor"><img alt="peteramthor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://trulyrural.com/cyberavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peteramthor">peteramthor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107315/#Comment_107315" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T21:35:10+00:00" title="November  7, 2007  9:35PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man I remember Osseum.

I filled out the application and sent my samples and waited. After not hearing anything for awhile, I pinged them a few times and got no response. I was pretty pissed off and felt left out in the cold like a second-class citizen. Fortunately, I was contacted shortly thereafter by Brennan and Ed of IPR. And, of course, I soon thereafter I learned why Osseum never got back to me. Best thing that never happened to me.<br/><br/>And my own personal horror story (short version): For Dawning Star, we were trying to launch nigh-contemporaneously with the release of the d20 Future rules into the SRD. Shortly after we started work, my writer begged out (which turned out to be a good thing because I hooked up with the awesome Lee Hammock). My agreement with my artist was for periodic payments during the design process. Because of the delay with the writer, I ended up paying him the full fee ($2,500--ack, don't get me started) before the writing ever really began. He produced a couple of pieces in the interim--very cool stuff. He posts the images on RPGnet, and someone notices that part of the images are cribbed from another artist's work. He literally stole a face from one illustration and did an entirely new illustration around it. I cant' even fathom why an artist would do that. Neeless to say, I ditched him right quick. He wouldn't return the money, so I ended up filing a lawsuit (I'm a lawyer remember) and getting a judgment for $7500 (treble damages for civil theft). Yippee, a piece of paper. He dropped off the face of the planet, and I haven't been able to collect a dime of it. On the plus side, this led me to Danilo Moretti, who is the Lee Hammock of artists.<br/><br/>If anyone knows where Gary Simpson is working these days, let me know so I can garnish his wages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107509/#Comment_107509" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T08:23:29+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  8:23AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gary did the original cover of <i>Little Fears</i> and, as such, he did some illustration work for my <i>Vesperteen</i> project before disappearing into the computer game storyboarding / illustration field after the <i>Dawning Star</i> debacle.

It sold well and we never had to produce more than a hundred to four hundred copies at a time so it was easy to manage from a cash flow perspective. Back then we delt with a mixture of hobby distributors that stocked games and game distributors and with that game about 75% of its sales were through the hobby distributors. Our next three products were also photo copied products, so all was well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy late 1997 we were attempting to upgrade our products to nice traditional production values. We had just printed 2,000 copies of the Dark Realms RPG and put it into distribution. Right on the heels of that we then produced our first board game, The War to End All Wars and had produced 3,500 copies. This was back before we had our own in house printing equipment and before POD was around much for books, so it was produce photo copied games or produce big runs through traditional printers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe released these games less than 3 months apart, but on the production end money had gone out the door for both during the same time period, so our available capital had been sapped and we were operating on fumes. Both released with decent numbers. 450 units out the door for the Dark Realms with nearly 300 in restocks within the first month. 850 units out the door for The war to End All Wars with 450 restocks within the first month.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem lies with the fact there was a distribution melt down happening under our feet and we were too new to the industry to know it. By late 1997 we were selling through 13 different game and hobby distributors. Unfortunately, by 1997 the distribution tier as a whole was at the point of bankruptcy due to the massive trading card glut originating from 1995. Of those distributors, Berkely, Armory and Chessex were the only ones to survive. The others all went out of business. Berkely got acquired by Top Line and that acquisition took about a year to shake out and outstanding invoices took about a year to get caught up with small publishers. Chessex of course was bought by the Armory and became alliance, but their debt load was even larger and it took almost a year before they started getting caught up with manufacturers as well. And naturally they were prioritizing payments to manufacturers who were releasing new products, which was kind of hard to do when no distributors were paying you what they owed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took to the beginning of 1999 to get invoices paid for product sold through the end of 1997 and in early 1998. Our photo copied miniatures line that had been our first product and the easiest to manage cash flow wise tanked sales wise because all the hobby distributors we had sold through had folded up shop and the game distributors weren't paying and we refused to send product out under those conditions. Trhoughout 1998 the only positive cash flow we had come in were two small direct sales diret to retail stores, about three hundred dollars in mail order sales (prior to having an e-commerce website, so these were all by mailed checks) and a coupke hundred in sales at local conventions. We did eventually collect every invoice owed to us by the distributors that were going out of business, but most did not get paid until later in 98 or in 99 and in a few cases the amount of money spent on long distance phone calls and collection notices cost us as much as what the invoices were worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sense of security these days is much improved now that our cash flow isn't tied to any other tiers within the industry. Its grea being independent.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding consolidators, nothing against the guys out there running them. But they have always seemed like a fools errand to sell through them. For most small companies the distributors only stock products through consolidators so they can avoid actually stocking your products in your warehouse. They use the consolidators as their warehouse and only push your products through the system on a very poorly run JIT basis. For this wonder dis-service, you get to stick all your (unpaid for) inventory at arms length where there is more expsoure to loss to the Wizards Attics/Osseums, and you get the honor of paying as much of 20% of your gross reciepts for this. Its paying extra to be marginalized and its always been a raw deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

I can't say that about any other POD publisher's RPG catalog.</blockquote>\nActually, I disagree about Lulu as well.  Lulu is not a publisher in the traditional sense (more like a printer that also does some fulfillment), and they don't really have a catalog.  If they went under, people would just print their games elsewhere.  Yes, many small press designers print their first game through Lulu because of the simplicity and availability, but Lulu going under wouldn't really put much of a dent in the indie games movement.  There are probably hundreds of POD printers out there right now.  Of the indie games that sell in the thousands annually (Burning stuff, SOTC, Dogs, Polaris, anything in the top 10-20 on IPR), I don't think any of them are sold through Lulu primarily.  It's possible that some of them use Lulu as an additional outlet, but Lulu is not really cost effective once you're moving a significant amount of product, compared to other services (like POD/short run + IPR/Key20, since Lulu's print costs are pretty expensive on a per book level).  Actually, I don't know how many of the top indie sellers are even printed through POD, since their creators are probably printing numbers high enough to use traditional short-run printing (which usually starts with printing 1000 copies in one sitting).<br/><br/>Other POD printers going under or going through big changes certainly effects how indie games are printed.  On the mailing list of IPR's publishers, we regularly discuss the current status of various POD or short-run printers because it's inevitable that someone is printing or reprinting a product at any given time.  The POD market also changes dramatically over time and depending on who's working with a given printer.  Often times, someone will report having major problems with one printer and another person will say everything worked out okay with them.  But, yeah, there actually have been cases where major changes were happening at a printer that multiple IPR publishers were using, causing a bunch of people to move their products to different printers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

They'll be printed on a high end brand new digital laser production machine. Most likely a Xerox. We'll be printing them onto a glossy cover stock, so they will glossy to a degree, but they won't have a varnish or lamination over top the printing. I've found no cost effective and labor effective means to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cards will be on a 12pt cover stock or a 14 pt index, depending on the machine we settle on. I have to check on which of those stocks will make for the best playing cards. They are fairly comparable in weight, but I suspect the index to be too rigid. I'll have to do some test printing with both and see what I get. It should be noted that both options are not quite as thick as your usual game cards like a Yugio, etc, and those cards do tend to be still a bit thinner than Magic, which is pretty 2 ply.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good thing is, the biggest problem with POD cards has been the die cutting. For which I shuld have the solution to that, with a computerized die cutter that will let me die cut darn near anything. So so long as the card images come out the same shape in the layout programs people are using, this program and machine should be able to cut exacting sized cards with properly rounded corners.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bad thing is, the die cutting machine is somewhat slow and thus somewhat labor intensive to operate. This drives the price up a bit. I think I will most like be looking at $.05 for 1/1 printed cards, $.06 for 4/1 printed cards and $.07 for 4/4 printed cards. And cards will have to be printed in groups of 9 or 18 and if printed in groups of 9, they'll have to be printed in some number of equal numbers. Now, the good thing is, I doubt I'll actually have a minimum order. If i do, maybe it'll something small like 10 decks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI expect I'll have all the details hammered out by the end of this month and hopefully be able to give a final thumbs up to the quality of cards I get as final products. Though I likely won't be taking any orders until the first of the year, which is when we plan to star moving equipment into our new digs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

Then with our first project they ended up printing the Dark Realms 1st edition core rules book 6 and a half months late. Reading your blog post was like a flashback for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same year we had submitted the game maps for the first edition of our board game The War to End All Wars to a local printer. They had reached the point of being 5 months late before we finally found out that they had taken the job knowing they didn't even have a press capable of doing the work. They had planned to job it out to some other printer but apparantly they had failed to find another printer that was cheap enough for them. They didn't want to return our deposit, so kept blowing us off with no plan in hand to ever finish the job. We had to threaten lawsuit on that matter before they finally got the job completed and then, sure enough, they botched it several ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry you had to deal with bad printers. They are the bane of small publishers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are the reason we eventually bought all the equipment to do our own books and other productions. Its something you may want to consider for yourself to avoid these sorts of problems for yourself. In reality, if all you want to produce are books you only need three machines.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Digital Duplicator or Digital Printer.<br/>\nYou can buy used digital duplicators of varying quality ranging anywhere from $200 to $1000. Or conversely, a new, fairly high end digital printer that can do color and black and white will run about $10K, but you can get a lease agreement where your monthly expense is just a couple hundred bucks. The upside to the digital duplicators is they print extremely cheaply and almost never break down. The downside is they rarely have inline collating options. Most any new digital printer will give you set collating so they can print the guts of a book collated together as its output, but the service contract you have will likely give you a cost per page double or more what the digital duplicators can provide.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Book Binder. The new table top binder model coming out of China can be purchased for $1,200 or less.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) A paper stack cutter. You can get a good older eletric one for about $800 and they are very reliable. You can find older manual arm cutters for as low as $200 to $300. And the new desk top models where you can pretty much just do one or two books at a time are running $200 to $500.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little bit of bargain hunting and you can be producing books in house, to order or in print runs as low as 50-100 at a time, for a set up cost of less than $2,000 plus paper, ink and glue supplies. Its very liberating not to have a production run and thousands of dollars tied up with a bad printer giving you an endless run around.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

All of that is very interesting stuff.  I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m to that point in my publishing career yet, but I do appreciate you taking to the time to explain all of that.  <br/><br/>My printer was actually the group formerly known as RapidPOD, but I have heard of similar stuff happening to the customers of McNaughton and Gunn.    RapidPOD\u2019s problems were many.  From what (little) they told me, they accepted too many jobs during the Origins-GenCon convention season, multiple machines of theirs went down at once, and the had either an ownership and/or management change in that same time.  All that, though, just makes the problems understandable but not excusable.  Needless to say, I won\u2019t be doing any business with them ever again.<br/><br/>Again, I appreciate the information, Ryan.  It\u2019s good to know what it takes to print a book.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
