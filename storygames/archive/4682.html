Recently a game called <a href="http://www.storycrafter.com/story/prologue.php?storyid=4180" rel="nofollow">Streets</a> showed up.<br/><br/>The setting is stark and reality-based, centered squarely on the experience of homeless youth in San Francisco.  A ton of story ideas pop up from this, but I had to wonder if maybe there were <i>too many</i> story options.  At some point a GM has to put a frame around a concept, because with the ability to come up with <i>anything</i>, players will do just that and the end result will be something too unfocused to succeed.<br/><br/>Now I'm not getting down on <i>Streets</i>.  As I wrote, I feel it's a great setting with genuine potential for meaningful stories.  Beyond <i>Streets</i>, I've seen this happen with games/settings of all types, including many of which I've been a part.

The grandaddy D&amp;D is pushed as complete fantasy adventure.  But a lot of them have the idea of an adventure made by a GM to give it focus. Others, like World of Darkness games, seem broad too, but usually have a lot of advice on how to give it focus as well.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I also find play by post, or any online play, is extremely susceptible to evaporation of interest regardless of the game.<br/><br/>So, I'm curious, was Streets' failing not giving any tools to the GM or players to focus a game (either advice or mechanics), forcing you to swim or sink on your own? Or do you think that the online play had a big roll in the lack of focus?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112640/#Comment_112640" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T04:42:00+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  4:42AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I imagine that the online component didn't help matters at all.  Without an active and nigh-tireless GM, such games tend to die from their own inertia pretty rapidly.<br/><br/>At least from my perspective, it failed to grab me as a player because I couldn't find a hook in the set-up as described.  It would be simple enough to create a street person -- and a few seemed to, judging from what I can see -- but without a narrative concept or a plot hook to concentrate on, it would just be an exercise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
