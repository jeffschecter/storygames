Here are the pieces :<br/>My website <a href="http://www.existanc3.com/" rel="nofollow">existanc3</a> : the problem is, the information is all there, but it is very "intellect"<br/>Our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Existanc3" rel="nofollow">Facebook page</a> : I'm building a FAQ to go there. It is mainly, the information from the website, but easier to read. But, the problem with the FAQ is that it's a lot of text, and people don't always read it. That said, part of this fact is going into the kickStarter page.<br/>So, our last piece is going to be a video "what is ExiStanc3 ?" : we're aiming at a 90/120 seconds video with this type of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B-Km9vAIwo" rel="nofollow">look</a>. We're hoping to produce this video in a couple of weeks.<br/><br/>One thing about the videos : we are preparing three "main" videos that we believe we need before going to sites like ENworld. Those videos are :<br/>- the "what is ExiStanc3" : provides information<br/>- a trailer : just like for a movie, a 90 seconds video, presenting one of the story of Avalanche<br/>- our first "DM's trick" : a short video, 70 seconds, a kind of "actual play" post, giving advice on role playing game and showing the product/service<br/>So, this is our plan.<br/><br/>Now, about this thread. Below is my FAQ. Since I'm using this content to write down the text for the video, I'm interested in having feedback. And yes, the FAQ is a little bit long, I know. I hope to "close" this thread with the presentation of the video.<br/>Important note : I'm targeting, with ExiStanc3, TT roleplayers, but also, fans of epic fiction and tabletop gamers.<br/>Otherwise :<br/><b>Does it help understand what I'm doing ? Does it complement the website (or should I just forget about the "intellectual" part) ? Am I missing some parts (would you like other questions, and, by the way, those first questions were built from first users' responses to the website and Facebook page) ?</b><br/><br/>So, here's the FAQ (and thanks for your help) :<br/><b>What is ExiStanc3 exactly ?</b><br/>A new approach to tabletop role playing games and an exciting project, ExiStanc3 covers many aspects. Here they are :<br/>\u2022\tA new way to write campaigns : a storyboard based on a calendar (<i>time, not only size, will now matters</i>)<br/>\u2022\tOur own campaign set in a heroic fantasy world : Avalanche (<i>not one, not two, not three \u2026 but five stories occurring at the same time. And all for the same price</i>)<br/>\u2022\tOur system : Shadow and Light (<i>it\u2019s a game, you\u2019ll need some rules at some point, as you could expect</i>)<br/>\u2022\tA website to help you manage your content : notes, maps, characters, locations, storylines (<i>the true heart and blood of any role playing campaign</i>)<br/>\u2022\tUseful uses of gorgeous illustrations and maps : more than 450 elements (<i>but no nudity</i>)<br/><br/><b>What is tabletop role playing game ?</b><br/>Tabletop role playing games are the real thing !! Here\u2019s how they work :<br/>\u2022\tYou play face to face with, ideally, a bunch of your of friends (<i>Around a table ? People still do that ? Yes and you can even drink alcohol if you\u2019re of aged</i>)<br/>\u2022\tOne player is the \u201cgame master\u201d and, more or less, animates the evening (<i>not the drunken uncle type of animation</i>)<br/>\u2022\tThe other players have characters, usually heroes, who interact with the \u201cworld\u201d (<i>sometime characters are kinky, and this is then another type of \u201crole playing\u201d game</i>)<br/>\u2022\tWhen the heroes face great dangers and try to save the world, for instance, the group refers to a bunch of rules to see if they succeed (<i>Yeah !! Throwing dices !!! But not for too long please \u2026</i>).<br/>\u2022\tThere are no winners, as the objective of the game is to create great stories and have fun together (<i>Is it then rather a toy than a game ? Maybe.</i>)<br/>\u2022\tStrangely, it is a really intuitive hobby, and you\u2019ve already played it (<i>haven\u2019t played cowboys and Indians ?</i>)<br/><br/><b>What is Avalanche ?<br/></b>Avalanche is our first campaign that is specifically designed as a storyboard :<br/>\u2022\tAvalanche, we believe, is a really gorgeous example of the vision we have for a new kind of product for the tabletop role playing games (<i>From a scale of 1 to 10, how much gorgeous ? 11, of course !!</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt describes a world, and five different major stories occurring over a twelve weeks calendar (<i>Everything is in a unique product with over 50 hours of gameplay</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt might be read, almost, as a novel or a comic book (<i>Never heard of tabletop role playing game but you\u2019re a fan of epic fantasy ? You might want to stick around \u2026</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt uses over 450 illustrations, all of them in \u201ccontext\u201d (<i>just to make sure it\u2019s material you would use during your games</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt proposes you mature stories with complex characters (<i>No rescuing the princess from the troll for the evil mage who will betray us at the end because he wants to control the realm but we will face him and defeat him, thus saving the day ?</i>)<br/><br/><b>What\u2019s unique about Avalanche ?<br/></b>The setting of Avalanche, a somehow classic heroic fantasy world, is quite common. What is truly unique about Avalanche :<br/>\u2022\tIt only provides you with the big picture, it\u2019s up to you to create the details (<i>You\u2019ll have to put some serious meat on those \u201cbones\u201d</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt uses a non-linear approach to describing the story, using a calendar (<i>It turns out to be the newspaper of the world</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt has no predefined place for your players in the world (<i>you\u2019re a hero ? Then prove it ! Unless you would prefer to side with the villains \u2026</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt proposes many stories occurring at the same time (<i>adventure, horror, mysteries, political intrigues, romance \u2026 choose your flavor</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt uses time as a strong constraint upon the players (<i>running against the clock might become a challenge in itself. Imagine the TV show 24 on acid \u2026</i>)<br/><br/><b>What is Shadow and Light and why would I want to use it ?</b><br/>S&amp;L is our system, developed specifically for Avalanche.<br/>\u2022\tAs easy to learn as a boardgame and design as such (<i>you know, rules that stand in a 32 pages booklet</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt manages in the same way social and physical conflicts (<i>even romance, lucky you</i>)<br/>\u2022\tProvide you with tools to create your weapons, spells and powers (<i>we\u2019re not planning on selling supplements with lists of \u201cstuff\u201d</i>)<br/>\u2022\tCan be used with the new comers or the experts, at the same table (<i>This should help you entertain everyone</i>)<br/>\u2022\tShadow and Light can be used with other campaigns (<i>wow !! this is so unique!!</i>)<br/><br/>Continuing on next post ...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419228/#Comment_419228" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T07:28:41+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  7:28AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What do you mean by taking tabletop rpg to the next level ?</b><br/>The \u201cnext level\u201d is, of course, a wink at role playing games. More seriously, here\u2019s what we mean :<br/>\u2022\tA story in a form that could interest novel or comics readers (<i>reading a campaign could be fun, really ? Really.</i>)<br/>\u2022\tRules that could target boardgamers who play games from Fantasy Flight Games (<i>let\u2019s not frighten anyone with a scary 400 pages rulebook</i>).<br/>\u2022\tThe use of a storyboard, an unfinished product, as a way to present a story, as most medias do : television, cinema, comics (<i>the final product ? your game.</i>)<br/>\u2022\tTools that help you manage, not the tactical options of combat, but your stories and the social interactions of your games (<i>isn\u2019t it what the \u201ctabletop\u201d part is for ?</i>)<br/>\u2022\tA website that would allow role players to develop, promote, share and even sell their content, if they want (<i>why not a sort of iTunes for rpg ?</i>)<br/>\u2022\tBottom line : creating a role playing game that non role players would want to play (<i>we\u2019re all nerds now anyway</i>)<br/><br/><b>You\u2019re talking about an \u201capplication\u201d, a \u201cwebsite\u201d, a \u201ctool\u201d, how is it supposed to help me ?<br/></b>Our unique approach to tabletop role playing games, regarding campaigns, proposes you products that are meant to fit into a \u201cwebsite\u201d :<br/>\u2022\tIt will help you access the right information at the right moment (<i>when you read the storyboard, when you prepare your game, when you play it \u2026 name it, you have it</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt will allow you to pinpoint the impact of your players to the original \u201cscenario\u201d (<i>There is no danger of \u201cbreaking Avalanche\u201d \u2026 in fact, the fun begins when you try</i>)<br/>\u2022\tLeaves all the paper behind : all your notes, sketches, maps are directly put into the product (<i>But all that mess, aren\u2019t you going to miss it ?</i>)<br/>\u2022\tShare the adventures, the characters, the location with your players (<i>Role playing games are about people and their interactions, their creativity \u2026 not dices and stats</i>)<br/>\u2022\tFinish Avalanche as an author and get your own unique copy (<i>think about \u201cfanfiction\u201d \u2026 but you are allowed to write into the book, create your own stuff \u2026 and publish it if you want !!</i>)<br/><br/><b>How come a storyboard is supposed to help me ?</b><br/>The use of a storyboard is our unique approach to the presentation of a tabletop role playing games campaign. It has the following advantages :<br/>\u2022\tStoryboards are, by definition, unfinished products, waiting for the creative to complete it (<i>You, your group \u2026 after all, it should be about your game</i>)<br/>\u2022\tThey are perfect to provide you with the big picture (<i>We help you with the overall coherence of the world, not the details of your specific game, delightful fragments of your imagination</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt allows the \u201catomisation\u201d of content : events, for instance, are small texts with an illustration, associated to other events (<i>Straight to the point \u2026 and gorgeous looking with that !!</i>)<br/>\u2022\tIt is non linear by nature (<i>Chapters are for novels, not for role playing games where anything can happen</i>)<br/>\u2022\tThey are just perfect to be put into a database (<i>Someone should develop a tool, or a website around that idea \u2026</i>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bobo%20the%20Carpenter" title="Bobo the Carpenter"><img alt="Bobo the Carpenter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bobo%20the%20Carpenter">Bobo the Carpenter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419263/#Comment_419263" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T15:35:51+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  3:35PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of this long list of bullet points, could you perhaps try to explain in a few short sentences what exactly it is you\u2019re doing or selling?

(At least for me: such a statement doesn't give me any confidence in the quality of the final product.)</blockquote>\nIt's not meant to be informative. When we did have some first responses from the text on the website, people responded that it was too serious and "boring". And, on our first experience on the Facebook page, we realized that more "relax/funny" stuff did get a better response. That's why we added the italic part on the FAQ. And from the first responses we've got, most people told us that the italic part was the main reason they would continue to read the FAQ.\n<blockquote>Is it a rules system? An rpg? A world background? A computer game? A campaign? A book? A set of tools for creating an RPG? A social whatever for communication between players? Planning and plotting tools for GMs? Some of those? All of those? None of those?</blockquote>\nIt is all of them, except the computer game.<br/><br/>So let's start this, what is Existanc3 :<br/><b>Avalanche</b><br/>It is a <i>campaign</i> for role playing game : the "setting" and the "adventure" are packaged into a single and unique product. Also, it is not chapter-based, but calendar based and it uses the form of a storyboard (high level description of the main events happening in the world, week by week). As of now it covers the first 12 weeks (Spring). Lastly, Avalanche is set in a, quite classic, medieval fantasy world.<br/>So, how does it look : a big, hard cover, 500 pages book, including 450 illustrations, all in context (for the characters/locations/groups/items and one by events, there are 350 events described). <br/>I do believe it is a new type of product. In fact, it looks more like a comic or a "strange" novel.<br/><br/><b>Shadow and Light</b><br/>It is the system. It is, more or less, a hack of Shadow and Yesterday (that's in part the reason of our name) with the use of some kind of "character burner" from the burning wheel. But, we really, really simplify everything, removing all kind of exceptions. Creating a character, for a new comer, takes around 30 minutes. Shadow and Light stands in a 32 pages booklet and comes with a player's aid that summarizes our rules. The look and feel we're aiming at is <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=176&amp;enmi=Descent:%20Journeys%20in%20the%20Dark%20Second%20Edition" rel="nofollow">Descent</a> or <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17223/world-of-warcraft-the-boardgame" rel="nofollow">world of warcraft, the boardgame</a>. <br/>Shadow and Light is the easy part of the project (I mean the problems are known). Note that Avalanche can be played with other systems : d20, TSOY, Burning wheel ...<br/><br/><b>The application/website</b><br/>This application helps the DM manages the "story" and "the world" : add events, modify existing ones, manage impact of the player in the world (this event didn't go as "written", then here are the events that will go wrong), find information easily in the "book".<br/>Also, the DM will create the "group", the "characters", their "story" (by the use of events), add all the secondary characters and locations, upload his map and sketches ... put also all his notes ... The DM also have access to a vast library of illustrations.<br/>So, the DM is "building" his own version of Avalanche and he can get it in pdf format.<br/>Advanced functions include stuff like character creation/progression, dynamic maps, dynamic r-map ...<br/><i>Social aspect </i>: with his account, the DM can "invite" players and associate them with "characters". The DM can present (make public) some parts of the "book" to the players. The players can also manage notes, their characters description and even write their own vision of the story, by the use of events. <br/><i>Itunes</i> : DMs could be able to "sell" as bundle some parts he/she has written. For instance : additional stories, all the guild of thieves (let's say 30 secondaries character), dungeons map ... Important note : I'm not sure I'll be able to "crowfund" this advance function of the project, given the restrictions of KickStarter.<br/>The website could be used without Shadow and Light, and without Avalanche. Thus, DM can could write their own campaign using the website ad try to sell it (it would then come with all the above functions).<br/>Now, I don't think any website/application offers those functions (with a campaign already in it).<br/><br/>I hope this is more clear and that you could see my problem about it ...<br/><br/>Last thing, here's how ExiStanc3 would be packaged (each item could be bought separately) as this could give you an idea of the reward structure we're building :<br/>- The book Avalanche (and/or pdf), 500 pages, hardcover<br/>- The characters' sheets for Avalanche and Shadow and Light (and/or pdf): 100 pages, softcover<br/>- Shadow and Light (and/or pdf): 32 pages booklet and players' aid<br/>- maps and r-map<br/>- membership for the website                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419297/#Comment_419297" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T08:30:25+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  8:30AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">@J_Walton</a> :<br/><br/><b>- who are the characters?</b><br/>They are "people" living in the world of Avalanche, at the time of the described events. I don't know the specifics. Avalanche is a big place, they are lots of choices. I'll give an example : if you were to play a role playing game with a group, in the world of George RR Martin's a game of throne, at the time of the events of the first book, who would be the characters ? If the group decide to be GreyJoy, Lannisters or crows at the wall, it's going to give you very different games. But there are two things for certain : the players need to make choices (they won't be able to play every parts of the book) and, at some points, the events in the world are going to influence (or hit) them.<br/><b>- what do they want to achieve?</b><br/>Then again, I don't know the specifics. That said, in Shadow and Light, we have integrated the keys aspect (we call it "motivation") as a way for characters to progress. When players create their characters, they come to choose a starting location, some "circles" (to use burning wheel's word) and some motivations. After that you've got a pretty idea of the game (at least, how it starts).<br/>Now, remember that Avalanche is meant to be completed by the group/DM and you should start it at the character creation. In Avalanche, there are lots of room for all kind of adventures.<br/>That said, I would strongly recommend the use of mechanics such as keys with Avalanche to optimize the experience.<br/><b>- how do they try to do that?</b><br/>See the above. But then again, I would recommend the use of a system that supports well social conflicts, as there is a lot of political tension in Avalanche, as a way to optimize the experience. <br/><b>- what is the GM supposed to do?</b><br/>A classic role I would say. Except, he's also in charge of managing the calendar. For instance, characters enter a town and ask what had happened lately : the answer is in the calendar. And yes, the "world" does feel like a living force.<br/><b>- what does the experience of play feel like?</b><br/>From a "scenario" point of view, I would really like it to feel like an home brew campaign, but with a lot of "coherence" in the big picture. As for the system, it would feel like a simpler version of TSOY.<br/><b>- what other games inspired parts of this game? (to have some points of comparison)</b> <br/>TSOY, burning wheel, for the system ... For the campaign, although I have never put my hand on it, I believe that Pendragon could have a similar feel : a strong context where you decide what you play and time is very present with major events occuring in the world.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Steve">@Steve</a> :\n<blockquote>What are you asking people to fund? From your notes, it could be a multi-media campaign setting or a website to help you manage campaign content.</blockquote>\nIt's both !!! I do have a very, very long stretch for the campaign ... it starts with the funding of the basic functions of the website up to stuff like "completing Avalanche" and very advanced functions.<br/>They are grouped together. My stretch is very fun, I think and we need specific video for each "group" of functions/content. I should have my specific stretch available soon.\n<blockquote>You have seven words to describe your Kickstarter.</blockquote>\nWe used to described ExiStanc3 as "the first story board, calendar based campaign for TT rpg, specifically designed to be used with an application to manage it, and its own unique system, Shadow and Light, as easy to use as a boardgame".<br/>Which we changed for "Taking TT rpg to the next level" (that's 8 words).\n<blockquote>Edited to add: Also, I love tonnes of the art on your website. It's very evocative. </blockquote>\nThanks. I know that the illustrations are a big asset. We're almost done with a video trailer that presents the story/art.<br/><br/>So, how do I get out of this mess ? <br/>Also, maybe I need to use "different" level of language, depending on my public ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419303/#Comment_419303" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T09:11:26+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  9:11AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just looked at your website, and it clears up a lot of questions (which this post did not). I have a few suggestions:<br/><br/>1. It's very difficult to launch three different projects at once. You might consider separating the three (website, game system, campaign book), so that people aren't overwhelmed with this incredible amount of information all at once. After all, there's a whole lot to learn about each one, and mixing them all together makes it hard to understand what the actual project is doing.<br/><br/>2. I clicked through to the French version of the website, and I can see that's written much more fluently and clearly. I would suggest that if you wish to sell this product to an English-speaking audience, you need to improve the quality of the English writing dramatically. Grammatical errors not only obscure what you're trying to say (e.g. the subject line to this post) but also reduce  a potential buyer's confidence in the quality of the product. It just doesn't look professional.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419355/#Comment_419355" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T06:39:54+00:00" title="August  1, 2013  6:39AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I would suggest that if you wish to sell this product to an English-speaking audience, you need to improve the quality of the English writing dramatically.</blockquote>\nAvalanche has been written in french, by myself, but has been translated in English by professional services. Everything we "publish" (i.e. sell) is produced by native English speaker. That said, for activities, like writing on our Facebook page or here, on forums, nobody can really do it except me ... so, I guess I need to take more time ...<br/>As for the website and the FAQ, we're just waiting a little for a "real" translation as we have doubts about the content.\n<blockquote>I just looked at your website, and it clears up a lot of questions (which this post did not).</blockquote>\nThe problem with the text is that people do not read it ... Otherwise, does everything seems there (given you take the time to read it) ?\n<blockquote>It's very difficult to launch three different projects at once.</blockquote>\nI do believe I need to launch them all at once, and for two reasons :<br/>1. I've been looking for the kind of product I'm proposing, specifically the website/application, for some years. There has been a couple of people who tried it, and frankly, they did come up with some good ideas (although, usually the user interface were just plain horrible), but they all had a BIG problem : no content.<br/>In fact, I think that nobody (or almost) cares about a website that would help manage campaign for TT rpg. Because nobody sees the use of it ... The main response of users is "so what ?"<br/>That's why I think I need to provide a concrete example of the type of "new" product such a tool could "create".<br/><br/>2. Now, that's the tricky part ...<br/><b>Avalanche </b>is already complete (in fact Avalanche, Spring, which covers the first 500 pages). It's all written, professionally translated, fully illustrated (450) with maps (7). It's done. I don't need to raise money to produce it.<br/>In fact, Avalanche is going to serve as a reward : starting at 25$ tiers, the pdf and at 100$ tiers, the printed book.<br/>I really want to use Avalanche as an example for using the tool, but also as an asset for the campaign. I'll include in the stretch, for later stages, other chapters for Avalanche (Summer, Autumn, Winter), but this is not my priority.<br/><br/><b>The website/application</b>. This is the real deal and this is where the funding will go. Like I mentioned before, I need to <i>prove</i> that this application will be useful to users. We're working on a video presenting the main features of the application (the wire-frames and the final design are currently work in progress) and we're going to use Avalanche as content in the site for the video.<br/><br/><b>Shadow and Light</b>. It is almost done and it's not something I intend to sell. We're giving it. In fact, that system really came late into the process of "definition" of ExiStanc3 : we did it part time in the last three years. When I had no system, it was kind of a problem : people would tell me "you don't have a game, since there is no rules". I guess I could go with an existing system, but then again, it would be a real mess. D20 ? Pathfinder ? TSOY ? Burning wheel ?<br/>Beside all the legal issue around the problem, those systems all are "product" in themselves. We're really positioning ourselves as an "easy to play" game and we really like to have our game stands in a 32 pages booklet. <br/>Avalanche is already a 500 pages book, I don't want to say "hey, and you also need that 400 pages book to play". Anyway, Avalanche can be played with [almost] any system, but that would be for advanced users.<br/>Finally, I'm selling Avalanche and Shadow and Light separately, because I believe we can sell Avalanche as some kind of "epic graphic novel" to non gamers.<br/><br/>So, see my problems ?<br/>We were talking yesterday (me and my associates on the project) about this thread ... we came to the conclusion that we did a " relatively good" job at "analyzing" the various components of ExiStanc3. What we're missing, now, we think, is some kind of "synthesis" about the project ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419790/#Comment_419790" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T08:19:28+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  8:19AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know this might sound strange, but this helps us (the working on this project).<br/><br/>What we've learned and the actions we need to take :<br/>- We need to take care of the public we're addressing. I'm targeting a<i> large and varied </i>audience and some "artifacts" might be useful for some audience, while not working with another. For instance, my FAQ seems okay for Facebook, but doesn't work here. Another example : we tested our material with some people who are playing boardgames, but not TTrpg. For them, there are two important things to reach them : the "product" must be evocative (it's more or less the quality/number of illustrations) and it has to look simple to learn. Those criteria wouldn't apply here ...<br/>- We believe that the synthesis for this project is really a new <i>approach/design to write campaigns for ttrpg</i>. And this approach allows easily to develop an application/website to help manage campaigns.<br/>- We need to be clear on what is being crowdfunded : mainly, the website/application.<br/>- Avalanche is going to be used in two ways : as an example of the type of product our approach can produced and as a leverage for the kickStarter campaign.<br/>- Shadow and Light is more tricky. We think we will use it for gamers who are not familiar with ttrpg.<br/><br/>Our video "what is ExiStanc3" is scripted and is going to be less than 3 minutes. Production is on its way ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
