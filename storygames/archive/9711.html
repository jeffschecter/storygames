At any time that you are able to get revenge on that person for humiliating you, roll the Wound's value; each success you get on the roll knocks one point off the Wound's value. In this way, you might not be able to salvage your pride all at once, and will need to prove yourself again and again </blockquote>\nWhat I'm worried about here is that I'm holding a player hostage to the dice - if he doesn't roll well enough, he's stuck with a penalty to social or mental activities, which might even make it harder to seek revenge in the first place.<br/><br/>Any suggestions?

But tell me what you think of this: the only way to heal Mental Wounds is to cause an equal or greater amount of Physical or Mental Wounds to the person that inflicted them onto you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could literally be a 1-for-1 trade. Thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Oooh.... You could have the trade-up be 1:1 for Physical wounds, but when inflicting Mental Wounds to them, it could be something like 2:1, so you really have to one-up them to alleviate your own pain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215711/#Comment_215711" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T09:16:22+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  9:16AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I like that. Strictly speaking, your idea is not contingent on a dice roll - there are ways to boost your dice pool enough to cause the wound you want on your opponent. <br>Yeah, this sounds like good stuff, especially the use of ratios. Thanks, man!                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
