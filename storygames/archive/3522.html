Follow the link for more info about the game. Long-story short, we're going to have an awesome Dawning Star game and raise a ton of money to help some needy kids (<a href="http://www.shrinershq.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.shrinershq.org</a>).<br/><br/>Here's the plan: I've got four tickets for a seat in the actual game--only four! I will auction the tickets off via Ebay one per week over a four-week period. The first ticket will go up for auction on Monday. (I'll post a reminder and a link here when it goes live.) The bidding starts at $60, but 100% of the proceeds will get donated to the hospital, so obviously I'm hoping to raise a good bit more than that. During the final week, when the fourth ticket is up for auction, I will also put 10 spectator tickets up for sale direct through my website and via One Bookshelf.com, priced at $40. (OBS has graciously agreed to waive their normal comission for the sales so all of the money will be going to the kids.)<br/><br/>Now, you might be saying to yourself that $40+ is a lot of money to spend for an rpg game. You'd be right. But this isn't just an rpg game, this is a once-in-a-lifetime event! For starters, everyone who comes--players and spectators alike--will enjoy free food and drink throughout the event. Everyone who comes will get a signed limited edition publication (fluff and rules usable in most any d20 sci-fi campaign, written by yours truly). Everyone who comes will get a limited edition hat or shirt (TBD, we're still working on the design). We'll also hold free raffles for some singular items (rare OOP game books, signed paraphenalia, etc.) throughout the event. That's roughly a $100 value. But that's not all! <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> <br/><br/>Players in the event will get all of that and more:<br/>-A complete copy of the entire Dawning Star line signed by the authors<br/>-<i>Future Players Companion</i> signed by JD Wiker<br/>-<i>Future Tiles: Starships</i> from Fiery Dragon Productions (thanks, guys!)<br/>-<i>Shadow War</i> (the DS mega-adventure) in pdf format upon its release<br/>-Oh yeah, a seat at what will prove to be an rpg event they'll never forget!<br/>-Customized PC creation with lead DS designer Lee Hammock<br/>-Inclusion of their PC in a future DS publication<br/>-A <i>custom</i> portrait of their PC by DS artist extraordinaire Danilo Moretti<br/>-And much, much more! (We are still talking with other companies for product donations like minis and dice.)<br/><br/>That's on the order of a $300-400 value. And, it bears repeating, 100% of all of the money received for the player and spectator tickets will be donated to the hospital. So get ready! Next week, you might just be able to get the rarest single piece of paper in the history of RPGs:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://dawningstar.com/DSVIPGameTicket1.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.
