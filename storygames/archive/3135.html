When they enter into conflict, they put these attributes at risk of change. Attributes also have "twists", which come in two types. An "uptwist" is an advantageous side of the attribute, and gives rerolls on failures; a "downtwist" is a disadvantageous side to the attribute, and forces rerolls of successes. Using an uptwist costs pool points, using a downtwist refreshes pool points (inspired by Thematic Batteries in Full Light, Full Steam).<br/><br/>There are five "grounds" of conflict, Physical, Mental, Emotional, Creative and Quintessential (which has to do with identity). When you call for a conflict, you declare the initial ground, and this obviously affects the narration, which attributes you can use and so forth. Either party in the conflict can also, at particular points, shift the ground - change to any other ground, and thereby access more attributes. Either party can yield the ground at any point. So far, so Dogs.<br/><br/>What I'm envisaging is that the more often you change the ground, the more extreme the consequences. The consequences, I think, should be changes to the attributes and/or twists. At the moment my idea is to tie the <i>number</i> of consequences to the number of ones and sixes rolled (1 is always a success and 6 is always a failure), but the <i>severity</i> of consequences to the number of grounds used in the conflict.<br/><br/>Since there can be up to five grounds in a given conflict, I need five levels of severity, though some of them could come with several options, I suppose. Ideas I have currently, in no particular order:\n<ul>\n<li>Twists get more dice (possibly leading to attributes getting more dice)</li>\n<li>Twists increase in number</li>\n<li>Attributes increase in number</li>\n<li>Twists become attributes in their own right</li>\n<li>Attributes become characterlike, with their own agendas (would perhaps only fit specific kinds of settings)</li>\n<li>Attributes get more or fewer dice (though this is already covered elsewhere in the rules, so I'm not keen on it)</li>\n<li>Dice (beneficial or harmful) are added temporarily and vanish after one use</li>\n<li>Dice (beneficial or harmful) are added temporarily and vanish after they roll failure/success/1/6</li>\n<li>Dice (beneficial or harmful) are added temporarily and vanish after one use UNLESS they show 1/6</li>\n<li>Dice are subtracted temporarily and regenerate after X number of turns</li>\n</ul>\nAny thoughts?

If you can't re-use grounds you've used before, there can only be four escalations, so you only need four levels of severity beyond "ordinary conflict". If there's no such restriction, you need more than five levels of severity. Either that, or just a few types of severity which can be applied cumulatively.</p>\n<p>What is the <em>purpose</em> of a conflict in your system? The reason I ask is: you say that a conflict risks changing an attribute, but some of the changes you suggest sound positive. Are you risking a negative effect in hopes of getting a positive effect?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71944/#Comment_71944" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T21:22:05+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  9:22PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, the first ground carries consequences too. And there is a restriction that you can't repeat.<br/><br/>The purpose of conflict is to bring about a change in an attribute, generally in the external world (i.e. the setting or situation), but potentially within a character who is being "attacked".<br/><br/>The side effect of conflict - which is what I'm considering here - is to change the combatants' attributes that they put "at risk".<br/><br/>Yes, sometimes the changes can be positive. Positive change is still a risk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
