                    So, supplements.<br/><br/>I've noticed that, while the big "mainstream" games have a great many supplements, very few indy games seem to. Now, there are obvious marketing reasons for that which I understand. But there's this exception: Sorcerer. It has, what, three supplements by the original author and at least one (Dictionary of Mu) that's third-party?<br/><br/>So, what is it about Sorcerer that makes it particularly supplementable? Is this something that other games could profitably (in both an economic and a non-ecomonic sense) emulate? Does it simply welcome supplements, or does it require supplements?<br/><br/>And in general, because I don't want a thread about Sorcerer so much as a thread about supplementability: Is supplementability a good thing?<br/><br/>[For Simpsons fans: The image currently in my head is from the episode where Lisa is in the Little Miss Springfield pageant and Krusty asks Amber Dempsey, "Do you think the Bill of Rights is a good thing, or a <i>baaad</i> thing?"<br/>Amber (after careful thought): Good thing?

                            Ron has a specific policy regarding supplements, I believe, which orients on making sure they have something *new to say* about the game.  Each one is wrapped tightly around a new concept or perspective on the game that you flat out can't derive from the core text.  <br/><br/>I think some indie games could be done as trilogies, at the least, and I've certainly thought about doing at least one supplement for Don't Rest Your Head.  And reinventions work too: consider that The Princes' Kingdom is a Dogs in the Vineyard remix, for example.  If you're very, very, very good at writing setting, you can get away with publishing a setting book -- look at The Mountain Witch's supplement Kwaidan (sp?), for example, or Judd Karlman's Sorcerer supplement, The Dictionary of Mu.<br/><br/>That said, consider these this bit of practical info that I believe I've been told *somewhere* (possibly by Luke Crane?):<br/><br/>You can expect at most about 25% of your "core" book's sales to lead to someone buying a supplement.  <br/><br/>That means if you want to sell 100 of your supplement, you should only expect that to be possible if you've sold 400 of the core.  Since I haven't done a supplement yet, I don't know how well this bears up, but I'll probably yap about my experiences -- once they happen -- over on my livejournal: drivingblind.livejournal.com<br/><br/>This is a good topic, though, and I hope it doesn't get lost.  I'm very interested in the collective wisdom on this one.                        </div>

                            The pitfall of writing with supplements in mind is that it diminishes the quality of the work.  I'm abbreviating a conversation that Josh and I have had on a couple of occasions, but the gist is that a game that's written as the start of a line tends to have features that I myself find unattractive.  The easiest example is the metaplots that were so popular in the 90s.  I specifically think of the Big Secret in the Deadlands books, which sapped a good deal of the fun out of a Deadlands game we played for quite a while.  <br/><br/>I'm certainly not intending to tar <cite>Sorcerer</cite> or <cite>Dogs in the Vineyard</cite> with that brush.  Even though Ron makes it clear that <cite>Sorcerer</cite> supplements are welcome, it doesn't seem that the core book was written to need them.  It's not that indie games aren't worthy or available to supplements.  More that they've already scratched their author's itch, and they're on to bigger and badder projects.                        </div>

<p>I don't like supplements, and likewise I don't care about supplementability. It's preferable for books to be closed systems, complete in themselves, than it is for one to lean on another.</p>

                            There is something to be said for supplements that are, basically, entirely new games.  Where you change enough of the original premise or rules that you're selling a new experience.  One wonders, however, why you wouldn't just release these as entirely seperate games, so people don't have to own the original.  For example, I bet Mu would sell more if you didn't need Sorcerer to play it.                        </div>

Technically, Mu requires both <i>Sorcerer</i> and <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>. That's one way to narrow your potential audience. I am more interested in Mu than vanilla Sorcerer, but I had to buy and wade through two Sorcerer books before Mu. <img alt=":\" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":\"/> </div>

                            The definition of 'supplement' is drifting a bit, here.  I don't see Dictionary of Mu to be a supplement for Sorceror, or Stranger Things as a supplement for Trollbabe in the same way that the Monster Manuals II-IV are supplements for D&amp;D.  A supplement adds something that isn't necessary to make the the core whole or complete.<br/><br/>Stranger Things and Mu are <i>iterations</i> of the ideas presented in Trollbabe or Sorceror - they're riffs on the central game.<br/><br/>The reason that indie games don't supplement well is that supplements are usually great honking chunks of atmosphere or color - things that are considered non-critical or even <i>passe</i> in narrative games.  There are plenty of ways that you could supplement these games - mainly by creating big books of situation.  The example that springs immediately to mind is Shock: - a supplement would have some example Shocks, along with how different Praxis pairs alters the themes of the story, along with some Minutiae to round it out.  It could take, say, Soylent Green, and show how to dig under the movie to find the things you can incorporate into your own games. (My stab at it is - Shock: Massive overpopulation.  Issues: Human dignity, value of human life, basic human rights.  Praxis: knowledge v. ignorance; authority v. desperation ... it might also be pragmatism v. idealism.)<br/><br/>In fact, I now demand that Joshua write this, and it be titled :Wave.<br/><br/>So it's not that supplements are unnecessary for indie games - but I think that work-wise, it'd be a shitload of work, because you're doing a lot of the heavy lifting which is usually relegated to the play groups.  That's a lot of extra wattage to pump out.<br/><br/>Part of the design decision behind DEAD was to make it as supplementable as possible.  I could spend the rest of my life making DEAD decks for different zombie-type stories.                        </div>

                            As a wannabe designer, I don't particularly approach design with supplementability or a lack thereof in mind. On the other hand, I have a huge variety of games I'm planning, ranging from solidly traditional stuff (<i>Thrash 2.0</i>) to really whacked-out artsy stuff (<i>we are flat</i>), and supplementability seems to roughly correlate with traditionalness. If I ever get Thrash 2.0 off the ground, the next step will be to write up the Weird Powers rules so the game can handle all the really weird fighting game characters, and if I really wanted to I could come up with half a dozen other supplements to write, not even including campaign settings. For <i>Tokyo Heroes</i> I'm planning a collection of monsters called Tokyo Menaces, but then for that game a collection of monsters is in effect a collection of adventure modules, but overall I don't think it lends itself well to supplements. <i>we are flat</i>, on the other hand, is turning out so weird and self-contained that supplements are inconceivable.<br/><br/>As a consumer/player, for the past few years there have been extremely few games that have interested me so much that I would be interested in supplements, and if a game can't do what I want with just a core rulebook, I'm going to be tempted to look for something that does. I like games that are simple-yet-complete, so (for example) for a universal system I'd prefer Risus, OVA, or Fudge over GURPS, but on the other hand totally new settings do interest me, whether it's that I'm intrigued by Dictionary of Mu, or that GURPS IOU and Discworld are really neat.                        </div>

                            Scenarios seem to be the only type of supplement we're putting out for Dead of Night, and quite frankly I can't really think of anything else I could put in a supplement. The only thing I'm really wanting to do is a proper sci-fi b-movie expansion for it, with pod people and martians and the like in, but that could just as well work as another standalone book, so why limit myself by making it a supplement.                        </div>

                            I don't think that Sorcerer is any more "supplementable" than most other games. It's simply that Ron has decided to make three supplements, and done it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there's Mu, and actually a plethora of other "one-sheets" taken to their logical extention. But, as mentioned, these are iterative. But, then, so are Brian's "Dead Decks." That is, they are more like scenarios than supplements. The difference being, in my mind, that scenarios are meant to provide a framework for an instance of play, whereas the supplements provide material to add to the core rules to be used with all play, even of other scenarios. Thus the relationship map stuff in the &amp; Sword supplement applies well to "scenarios" like Clinton's "Urge."<br/>
<br/>
Or Dictionary of Mu, which is a scenario that, as mentioned, demands a particular supplement to play.<br/>
<br/>
Bob, see the thing is that Brian almost got it right: these sorts of designs don't support scenarios well. Rather, given that the games usually are very character driven, the idea of a scenario being prepared without the specific PCs in mind seems almost anti-thetical to the sort of play that the game promotes. I mean, OK, the sorcerer player comes up with his kicker...now how to you reconcile that with a pre-prepared scenario that has nothing to do with that kicker. Or anything else that the player thinks is interesting about the character?<br/>
<br/>
Now, that said, it's actually not impossible to create "situation scenarios" that have some generic draw - where the character to scenario links can be relatively easily forged. Or where the situation relies upon something common to all characters from that game.<br/>
<br/>
For example, Ron's HQ scenario "skullpoint" caters to this style of play because the book it's in assumes that all of the characters will be Lunar Hating Heortlings. So that's easy to play off of in design. The HQ scenario "Well of Souls" uses a Chris Chinn technique where you create a relationship map off of a central conflict that's bound to be easy to draw most characters into.<br/>
<br/>
But HQ is relatively easy for this. Other games are not nearly so easy to design scenarios for. So, with Sorcerer, for instance, you get the One Sheets instead. And there are a lot of these published. OTOH, you have something like DitV, which is practically screaming for a book of towns.<br/>
<br/>
Why hasn't this happened yet? I don't know (or has it?). That said, originally we thought that with Universalis that there would be a need for supplements that were basically huge sets of pre-generated components. But what we found is that it's actually so simple to do that doing it in play is more interesting than looking things up in a reference. So the design spoke and took away the opportunity for supplements there.<br/>
<br/>
What turns out to be true is that there's a segment of people who play a ton of different RPGs, for whom a suppement of a particular game just wouldn't add much, because they play it only occasionally. For an ironic example, I played InSpectres the other night - second time this year. Every once in a while it's worth pulling out. At that rate of play, a couple of times a year, very simply, the basic book gives me all I'll ever need. The ironic part is that I created an "iteration" of the game called Geek Season (with Sean Wipfli) years ago, and still haven't played it to date.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of buying supplements, I buy other games. I bought Wyrd is Bond a couple of years ago, and, despite organizing to play it a couple of times, it still hasn't gotten off the ground. Why do I need an InSpectres supplement when I've got entire games I haven't played on my shelf waiting to play them?<br/>
<br/>
The point is that some of these games are "small" enough that they make more sense for occasional play. The Roach, for instance - a supplement to that would simply be overkill. Unless it revolutionized the game in such a way as to make it really a new game to play. (Actually I could see scenario packs of cards perhaps). Actually InSpectres is best when its played in a campaign, truth be told. But I even haven't gotten around to exploring all of that yet, and that's part of the original game.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm saying is that you have to be careful with supplements. Often people have all they need to play the game already, and don't need anything to "refresh" it for them. In these cases, supplemental material might just sit on shelves rotting. OTOH, "scenarios" that end up being one-shot plays, or entirely new games in some ways, (again, Schism, or Urge), can be sellers to some extent. But, as Fred points out, probably at about a quarter the rate of the original game. If that.<br/>

                            I'd say yes, it is definitely much more viable to produce supplements via pdf than print. We produce licensed supplements for a semi-mainstream d20 title and I know that the sales figures we get for the supplement would be next to worthless to the publisher, but because we're a small company who put them out as pdfs it's actually quite profitable ... at least for us.                        </div>

                            I'd also point out that some subjects are good for supplements just because the person who's interested in that topic is not interested in concocting a game around them, and a pleasant system that gets out of the way is exactly what they want and they want nothing more.  See my labor-of-love-nobody-will-ever-care-about D20 O. Henry supplement. I don't much feel like working out a robust system around it, I'll just take someone else's.<br>
<br>
This is primarily a part of "open" systems, although fan.supplements have been common for many years.                        </br></br></div>

                            Looking back at my gaming history, I have a lot of supplements that have sat on shelfs collecting dust, a decent handful that provided their money's worth of entertainment, and small handful that are referenced time and time again.<br><br>The ones that provided their money's worth are scenarios, almost exclusively for D&amp;D. Old school dungeon hacking in D&amp;D was quite amenable to off-the-shelf scenario play.<br><br>The ones that are referenced time and time again provided needed expansion of character options. Cults of Prax is the most definitive example here (which one might argue SHOULD have been part of the original rules book). For the original D&amp;D, Greyhawk and Blackmoor probably easily fit in this category.<br><br>There are a few supplements which provide some very valuable additional rules.<br><br>The supplements that languish on the shelves are "campaign" supplements. Some are additional encyclopedic information on a setting. Some are linked campaign scenarios. The latter are the most problematical supplements in my opinion. They start to drift into providing meta-plot. Another set is endless character options, with D&amp;D 3.0/3.5 being the worst offender (but GURPS setting the stage, with early antecedants in the endless supply of alternate D&amp;D classes from magazines). The endless books of monsters for D&amp;D (all the way back to the original Fiend Folio) are another example.<br><br>D&amp;D did benefit from additional monster, magic item, and spell material, however, where it tended to work out the best was when such material was presented in a module, or a magazine article (where the magazine had plenty of other interesting stuff, even if not of particularly lasting value). Of course over time, the problem arose of referencing back to the original source of something, and so collected anthologies of supplemental material became of interest (the Fiend Folio was at its heart an anthology of monsters from White Dwarf magazine, though it provided at least as many monsters that had not been published before).<br><br>When I look back at my RuneQuest campaigns, Cults of Prax, as mentioned, was an absolute necesity. Improved maps from later supplements provided enticing details, but I've made almost no use of Troll Pak. I've started Borderlands twice, and quickly abandoned it. Pavis was of mild interest, but has never held my attention (despite a strong yearning to collect city maps - but honestly, I've made very little use of such - making me quite the fool for dropping $120 on Ptolus... I probably could have run a quite nice Ptolus based campaign using just the $3 player's guide [or the free PDF of same]).<br><br>What really frustrates me about D20 is that the game has reached the point where the traditional old school dungeon actually does not work well. Back in my early AD&amp;D days, we could blow through a typical module in a long (8-10 hour) session, perhaps sometimes two. But that was because many rooms were handled something like: "We open the door, ooh, a bunch of orcs, use the fireball wand." In a typical 4 hour D20 session, we at most deal with three battles, and perhaps 5-8 rooms in a dungeon. This comes way closer to fitting the schema that I ran Cold Iron under, my Cold Iron campaign having been heavily powered by small modules from Dungeon Magazine. Sadly these days, those small modules are no longer being written up in Dungeon Magazine.<br><br>Looking to other games: Traveller benefitted from the expanded character options in supplements, some additional equipment, and improved ship building rules. I never got much out of the scenarios. Of course Traveller was also very problematical to run. I also eventually abandoned most of the Traveller published material... Champions, well Champions II was nice. I never used the organization supplements, and the scenarios were of little interest. Of course I also didn't run all that much Champions.<br><br>Another interesting line of supplemental material is new games based on the same mechanic. I've got a bunch of RQ derrivatives sitting on my shelf (or in the case of Call of Cthulhu, having been sold). I've never really run any of them, though played around with chargen in most. Deadlands: what a waste of my time. Seventh Sea, same deal. GURPS - ok, perhaps some cool setting information - that I've never used, for GURPS or anything else (I'm not sure whether to classify GURPS as a bunch of derrivative games, or a supplement mill...).<br><br/>Now for Dogs in the Vinyard, it would be nice to have a nice collection of towns. I might even pay for a PDF that had a well thought out collection, perhaps with some commentary, and perhaps even an AP report or two for each town. Why PDF? Because I absolutely want to be able to print out a one-sheet for reference during play (I'm convinced almost any DitV town can be formatted onto a single page, at least in a format for those of us with good eyes, for folks with not so good eyesight, format it onto a few pages, with some nice artwork). I guess a nicely bound book that came with a PDF of the one-sheets would be a nice product. The book would be nice to curl up in bed with to get ideas for play (from the commentary and AP reports) and then off to the computer to print off the one-sheet for play. Of course at some point in a Dogs game, one will have to start writing up one's own towns so that you can follow up on how the players have reacted in the past. There's probably only need of one of these books, though one every couple years or so (or maybe even one a year) would provide an enjoyable read (given the commentary and AP reports). The book could even have a FAQ section in the back.<br/><br/>Frank                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            For DitV, a book of towns would be really cool, and, essentially, a book of scenarios. Okay, they fall into that category of scenarios where everything is up to the players. I'm good with that -- the best published Cyberpunk scenario I've seen to date falls into that category.<br/>
<br/>
A book of islands for TPK would mean that I'd have run a session already. I haven't found time to make up an island, and the examples in the book, while good, aren't clicking in a "Yeah, I want to run that one" way.<br/>
<br/>
PDF or hard print, both cool for those. Simple text descriptions -- or supplement with rough maps, geneaologies, whatever -- both cool.<br/>
<br/>
(There's a tangent that could be had about scenarios with pregen characters, but that's not for this thread, I think.)<br/>

                            One of the original plans for <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> was to present the "core game" as faction-agnostic and then release supplements for the solar powers (Britain, France, Russia, America, Japan, Netherlands), pirates, and bored middle class tourists.  One day I sat down to sketch an outline for what would be included in such supplements, and I found that I'd just be rehashing the same stuff over and over in each book.  I ditched the idea, because I didn't want to commit myself to writing that crap for two years (and you'll notice the mainstream farms that stuff out to freelancers).<br/><br/>Here's the thing, though: given adequate marketing effort, I'm positive that said supplements would have sold.  Assuming <em>FLFS</em> has any market penetration outside of story-games, which it turns out it does, there would be a market for supplements.  And using some stupid-simple production tricks like a layout template that could be tweaked for flavor rather than rebuilt and using cleverly reused art, I could have put the things up on Lulu for little investment in cash or time.  So whether or not the mainstream makes money off of their supplements, I'm pretty sure the indie model is perfectly capable of doing so.<br/><br/>From an artistic standpoint, though, the supplements didn't interest me.  This was compounded by the fact that anything I could have put into those rules could be figured out by the players.  From a publishing standpoint, I wasn't really providing material to the audience.  Maybe over the next year as I shill the game at cons and field questions on it, I'll come up with new advice and clever rules tricks.  Theoretically I might be able to do something like the Sorcerer And books.  I'd rather just stow such ideas away for a second edition in a few years.<br/><br/>Besides, there's so many other interesting ideas out there.  Chaining myself to <em>FLFS</em> would drive me crazy. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            I tend to concur that indie games are just as supplement-able.  I think the main reason there are less supplements is that indie games are, almost by definition, the part-time project of one person.  Thus, it's not easy for a person to write his own supplements, and not much structure for writing supplements for other people's.  <br/><br/>I'm going to turn around and say that I feel that indie supplements are a good thing.  <br/><br/>Good, usable supplements are one form of support.  If your game is going to have staying power over the years, it needs to have support -- whhich can be published books, published PDFs, or simply free advise/scenarios/reports on the web.  For my money, I'd prefer it if more people would collaborate and/or support others' games for a while, before publishing their own game.                        </div>

                            My excuse is that I'm so scatter brained when it comes to new ideas. By the time I've managed to shepherd an idea all the way to publication, I've had so many other ideas that MUST be developed that I want to write something new and shiny rather than stick about writing a supplement for my last game!                        </div>

                            Well, different people have different attractions to books.  <br/><br/>Some people like to buy bare rules systems, but make up most of the background, characters, and scenarios themselves.  Other people like to write or homebrew their own rules, but are interested in buying a background setting with nice pictures and maps.  Other people like to buy scenarios to run.  <br/><br/>Personally, I got a fair amount of mileage from reading about other people's town designs, so I don't have a problem with a book of such.  Also, I note that a lot of people have done adaptations of Dogs in the Vineyard to other settings.  This seems like something which could be covered in a supplement (or supplements) as well.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>As a consumer, I can definitely state that one of my attractions to the indie model is<b>no supplements</b>. I think a Book o' Towns for DitV is a terrible idea, and I for one would not purchase it.</blockquote>
Which, weirdly, is just the dead opposite for me. I've skipped DitV because i didn't think the core game was something I'd be interested in. Now, an inexpensive supplement (probably pdf)of towns/pregens/variants <b>might </b>act as the deciding factor that causes me to reconsider.                        </div>

                            It's interesting.<br/><br/>Polaris is intended to come with supplements.

                            After I finish work on Dread, I'm going to be releasing the Second Book of Pandemonium, which will introduce new opponents.  It will also contain new scenarios.  The details of the third book aren't clear to me yet, but I do know that it will also consist of supplementary material.<br/><br/>As a GM, I love scenarios, monsters, maps, and all that other content that helps me get my game up and running quick.  I love it more, now that I have a family (same for the other people in my gaming group).<br/><br/>Since I'm selling the books via Lulu, there's no need for me to invest anything other than time (unless I elect to hire artists to illustrate these supplements, which I probably will).<br/><br/>I think supplementability is a good thing, because I'm the type of gamer who needs that kind of material from time to time.  Back in the day, when I could literally game five nights a week during summer vacation, supplements were useful, but not necessary.  Other than a girlfriend and a summer job, I didn't have much to distract me from creating all this elaborate content to drive my games.  These days, I consider it a worthwhile investment to shell out twenty or thirty bucks for a good sourcebook of ready-made material.<br/><br/>Of course, this only applies when I'm running a D&amp;D or Star Trek game or something.  When I'm running Dread, it's all original content, baby.  I make time for that.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

Nothing wrong with the Internet.  You can play lots of games without having to pay anything just by going to various people's pages (including, say, D&amp;D from it's SRD), free PDFs, and surfing various lists.  <br/><br/>However, it's nice having things edited, polished, and in printed form that can be used when you're not online.  It also then has the potential to reach people who aren't online.  For the same reason why I prefer nicely printed games rather than an HTML dump of the text, I prefer support to be nicely packaged as well (all things being equal).                        </div>

What exactly is it that bothers you so much about that sort of thing droog?<br/><br/>I mean, I can understand that you personally wouldn't feel the need or desire for those things, but your reaction to the idea of them even existing seems a bit extreme to me.                        </div>

                            I swear this wasn't my intention when I started this thread, but I'm now working on a game deliberately designed to be supplementable - in the sense of easily adaptable to new genres. (I frequently see people here saying, "I want to do a game in such-and-such a genre, any recommendations for a system?")<br/><br/>System Matters. But what does that mean, exactly? If you're talking about games where story is the main thing (to avoid a bit of jargon), then System Matters surely means "the system you are using influences what kind of stories you can/will create". And there's a degree of universality to Story; you can tell the same basic kind of story in multiple settings and genres (just look at the pulp magazines which established these genres in the first place, and the people who wrote for all of them under different names).<br/><br/>So what I'm working on is a game which will structure the creation of stories in a particular way (5-act structure - going with the classics); will inevitably be about the things the characters care about; and can bolt on things like gadgets, magic and so forth as "special effects". And sets out deliberately not only to permit but to encourage conversion to different genres by means of supplements. Not least because I plan to release it CC-Attribution.<br/><br/>At the moment I call it "Acts of Increasing Desperation", but I'm thinking of dropping the word "Increasing".<br/><br/>Further bulletins as events warrant.<br/><br/>EDIT: <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Acts%20of%20Increasing%20Desperation_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">very initial draft</a> with lots of notes about stuff that's missing. In evolutionary terms this is the "small shrew-like mammal" version.                        </div>
