The primary conflict I've seen, though, is about learning and understanding.  "We'd really like to know what to do with this widget the aliens gave us, but we might not be able to figure it out!"<br/><br/>The failure conditions vary a bit, and there's certainly more drama when failure means starvation or being trapped or caged or something, as opposed to just frustration, embarrassment, and some wasted time.  I can't claim that every session I've played has included high drama.  The arc of learning and discovery has always been satisfying to me, though, with or without high drama.<br/><br/>My own draft conspiracy game, <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/The_Eye_in_the_Pyramid.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Eye in the Pyramid</a>, follows a similar logic.  GMs can introduce violence if they like, but really play is about encountering unknowns or secrets, forming theories, and eventually finding out the truth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458378/#Comment_458378" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-28T01:03:27+00:00" title="November 28, 2016  1:03AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that in gaming, traditionally, rules have focused on violent conflict in a major way. Character creation, advancement (e.g. XP rules), and resolution rules all pointed towards fighting and killing each other. (Consider, for instance, that D&amp;D's hit points, for all the abstraction they represent tell you when someone is dead but not at all who won the fight or who got what they wanted.)<br/><br/>This meant two things:<br/><br/>1. If you are playing a character in such a game, and you're not getting what you want, the only way you can enforce your will is by going to the sword. Someone disagrees with you? Your only leverage is to attack and fight them.<br/><br/>Combat, in this setup, becomes your only lever against the fictional reality you're playing in and all its other inhabitants. <br/><br/>(You can see from this why so many D&amp;D players, for an example, would get incredibly angry if they found out their GM was "fudging" combat results.)<br/><br/>When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.<br/><br/>(The spells in old-school D&amp;D are a really interesting counterpoint to this - an exception to this general rule - and, for that reason, I've always been sad to see them becoming more and more combat-focused with each edition.)<br/><br/>2. If you've invested so much time and effort in learning a game system, creating a character, picking powers and weapons, and so forth, you're going to (quite naturally) want to be rewarded for all that work.<br/><br/>There's all this *fun stuff* in the rulebooks, right? I want to see it in action!<br/><br/>Players (and GMs, to a lesser extent) quite naturally want to gravitate to this material. It's something you've thought about, it's probably something designed to be exciting, and it's something you can really dive into to find you have some agency in the game when it's lacking.<br/><br/>From the above two points, I think an expectation has been created among gamers to always expect and seek out violent conflict - combat - in their games. I've seen it go so far as for people to say that "roleplaying without combat is like pizza without cheese", or even to say that a game without a combat system is not an RPG at all.<br/><br/>I think there's absolutely no reason - other than the history of roleplaying game - to assume anything like that. There are now a myriad games out there which create intense, powerful experiences without any fighting at all (and sometimes without even the *option* to include any fighting!).<br/><br/>The things which make those games engaging are all the same things which make any game engaging: interesting characters in interesting situations, a cool premise, escalating conflict, emotionally-driven stakes, mysteries, surprises, game rules you can use or manipulate to create uncertain outcomes, ways for the players to compete with each other, ways for us to imagine and experience unfamiliar people and places, and ways for us to surprise each other.<br/><br/>When I think of the games which are typically considered "story games", I'd say MOST of them achieve this goal, and with panache. It would be easier to list games (in this genre) which focus solely on fighting.<br/><br/>However, even among "story games", there is often a focus on violence and violent conflict, particularly - to take a popular example - in the games of Vincent Baker. <br/><br/>Violent conflict makes a powerful statement about human desires and our limited abilities to reconcile them with each other. It is the final stage in any two human beings' attempt to control each other.<br/><br/>For this reason, a lot of "story games" do feature violent conflict, but often with a subtly (or not-so-subtly) different focus: rather than looking at the "how" of fighting and violence, let's try to look at the <i>consequences</i> of violent conflict.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458381/#Comment_458381" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-28T01:44:46+00:00" title="November 28, 2016  1:44AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RPGs are rooted in genres that feature romanticized violence, like sword&amp;sorcery and space opera. And games of any type often involve violence because it's the most direct expression of conflict.<br/><br/>Subtler types of conflict can be hard to represent in game mechanics. Many games have extrapolated combat mechanics to "social combat", but this runs into trouble with narrative -- you don't have to be a good swordsman to say "I run it through with my sword!", but a social conflict is largely based on talking, and it's awkward to separate the character's supposed silver tongue from the player's actual words. If the player just says "I talk the countess into letting me visit her bedroom tonight," that's boring.<br/><br/>Successful nonviolent games might be ones where there's little serious conflict at all, like Ryutama (the closest thing you'll find to a "My Neighbor Totoro" RPG) or Breaking The Ice, or where the conflict is pretty much unwinnable, as in the more truly Lovecraftian horror games like "Lovecraftesque".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458384/#Comment_458384" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-28T02:58:14+00:00" title="November 28, 2016  2:58AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Subtler types of conflict can be hard to represent in game mechanics. </blockquote>\nI'm not at all convinced this is true. Perhaps from a typical "gamer" mindset, modeling other kinds of conflict is unintuitive. But it really shouldn't be! Just look at card games and board games: they have no problems at all making proceduralized versions of financial competition (Monopoly), exploring a new land (Settlers of Catan), etc - with no "fighting" in sight. Pick your theme and go at it.<br/><br/>From the other end of the spectrum, any story games with "generic conflict" mechanics (like Primetime Adventures, the Pool, etc) easily run the gamut of any and all conflicts.<br/><br/>Recently, there's been development in more subtle game design, too, which is fun.

And Catherine could be argued to be emotionally "violent" with themes of infidelity, if someone was shooting for something that would arguably do "no harm" that Buddhist monks could play ha ha <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  of course, I'm not making that argument; themes of violence and other less vanilla things can inform the human experience and teach valuable lessons\u2026 Anyway I'm rambling :-)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458396/#Comment_458396" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-28T22:26:57+00:00" title="November 28, 2016 10:26PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2016 10:38PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_the_Ice_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">Breaking the Ice</a> is an example of a non-violent game, at least from what I remember.</blockquote>Oh yeah, that's right, romance and relationship games!  A few more I can list: Shooting the Moon, Under my Skin, It Was a Mutual Decision, It's Complicated.\n<blockquote>Right, romance is a good example of a theme that can be nonviolent yet create tension and drama.</blockquote>Besides romance and non-violent mystery/conspiracy/thriller fiction, there's also individual character dramas (e.g. "man vs self") like Good Will Hunting.  Plus a lot of comedies which invoke dramatic stakes where they fit -- romance, crime, wealth/poverty, etc.  Speaking of crime and money, I think I've seen some con artist movies with no violence -- Nueva Reinas, for example.<br/><br/>A game about whether the protagonists "make it" -- whether that's succeeding at crime or in their careers or in court -- can be plenty dramatic without violence.<br/><br/>Courtroom drama, there's another genre.<br/><br/>Maybe the Tribunal LARP fits in there?  The surrounding context is all about coercion and war, but there's no violence within the game itself.<br/><br/>Oh, also kid-friendly stuff, like Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple.  Just like any good kids TV show, it's about working together to solve problems.  There can be plenty of drama in whether those problems get solved!  I think Flatpack and Chuubo's are similarly about quests that might not succeed but not due to violent opposition (though I could be wrong).<br/><br/>Then there's FreeMarket, a game where everyone's functionally immortal and violence is pointless, and the drama is about the struggle to matter and succeed in this weird post-scarcity economy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458397/#Comment_458397" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-28T22:31:26+00:00" title="November 28, 2016 10:31PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I read recently was <i>Beginning Idol</i>, a Japanese RPG where (as one might infer from the name) you play as members of an idol singer group, trying to balance work, training, and interpersonal relationships. The challenges in the game are primarily (in the core rules, at least) based on determining how well you do your job or nail a performance, rather than being competitive/oppositional.<br/><br/>Mechanically it does this by being a rather firmly-structured resource management game that forces you to make choices in preparation for a final big performance that's determined by a lot of fiddly dice rolls, wearing appropriate outfits, using special items, and/or invoking your friendships with your co-idols for various benefits while trying to avoid a total breakdown due to stress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RickDean" title="RickDean"><img alt="RickDean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/466/nYRCWQBW2OXHC.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RickDean">RickDean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458400/#Comment_458400" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-28T23:58:10+00:00" title="November 28, 2016 11:58PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the concept I'm trying to address directly with the game I'm currently developing.

Characters and narrative are still present, and can be developed by players if they wish, but 90% of the mechanics center around description and imagination, so it shifts the whole mental mode of the game into a realm where violence doesn't even occur to the players, and there's no specific way to address it.<br/><br/>To build tension in such a game, I'm trying things like keeping certain pieces of information at least partially hidden from players until a later point in the game, or restricting the kinds of conclusions that can be drawn until a certain stage of the process.  The tension is driven more by mysteriousness and curiosity than fear or danger, which also helps downplay violence (and even conflict in general) while still holding the players' attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458403/#Comment_458403" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-29T00:28:28+00:00" title="November 29, 2016 12:28AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rick, that sounds similar in some ways to Sign in Stranger, which I described above, and is one of my all-time favorite RPGs!

Damon Knight's story "The Country Of The Kind" is about a utopia(?) where violence and hate have been somehow eliminated from humanity, except for one throwback; they're too pacifist to kill him, so everyone just shuns and avoids him, and all his senseless violence just gets quietly fixed up, and he's going insane trying to find someone else like himself...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458412/#Comment_458412" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-29T07:07:09+00:00" title="November 29, 2016  7:07AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2016 7:08AM by Rickard.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all.

How does a investigator feel and think during a murder case? What are the drives and background of someone that humiliate themselves to get the attention of others? How does it look like, and how would people react, if something unexpected happened to them?<br/><br/>And anime like Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Spirited Away shows different perspectives of life - real or imaginative.

The game is certainly not FOCUSED on conflict, though I explained the rules for it because that's what we're talking about in this thread.

The fox spirit can turn invisible, levitate, and summon rain, while the Tanuki spirit can change shape (moreso than the other types of spirits that is, since everyone has a human form and animal form), create copies of themselves, and make people laugh by doing a silly dance.  The cat spirit can move around unnoticed, summon other cats, and pretend innocence.  Dogs can make people feel better by licking them, protect others from harm, and are easily forgiven for mistakes.

Yes, you probably need to find out why they were fighting.  That's correct.  It's implied in my example - you're not going to help them reconcile otherwise.  Your second one, likewise - if you don't understand what kind of person they are, how are you supposed to help them?  I don't even know what the third example means.<br/><br/>But no. The game is not about introspection. The game is about HELPING PEOPLE.  And that usually means that there is a problem.  Usually in the past or the future, rather than a clear and present current danger.  You are not generally going to participate in their arguments.<br/><br/>Which is why I feel that you classing this stuff as "conflict" is inappropriate.  The "conflict" is usually done by the time the game starts.\n<blockquote><br/>Whenever we talked about <b>Golden Sky Stories</b> in my roleplaying game theory group in my city, the examples given were conflict-based. I'm presume it's because Westerners think in that way when it comes to stories.</blockquote>\nI fundamentally disagree with what you consider to be "conflict based" but no, it's not about a Western viewpoint either - it is quite literally how the game is framed.  The example scenario is a child who is crying because he had an argument with his friend, who is now looking for him, but neither is good at "making up."  Another is about someone who is lonely because they have trouble connecting with people. The game is about solving everyday problems.  It is not a game about "being", it is a game about "being helpful"\n<blockquote><br/>\u2022\xa0A man sitting in an empty apartment.<br/>\u2022\xa0Waiting for the phone to call.

Conflict.  People died and other people have to cope. Conflict.   Moving on with your life. Conflict. Same stuff as my examples above.  But again - most of them are "conflict in the past" (except for your first example, which seems an awful lot like conflict is actually happening now, for your strange, loose usage of "conflict").<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458471/#Comment_458471" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-01T17:51:46+00:00" title="December  1, 2016  5:51PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Airk,<br/><br/>It's pretty difficult to analyze fiction when coming from the entrenched "conflict-based" mindset - one which is effective, powerful, and, in our culture, ubiquitous.<br/><br/>But read the article Rickard linked to; it will explain a lot of things, and then we can resume the conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458473/#Comment_458473" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-01T18:05:31+00:00" title="December  1, 2016  6:05PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a similar, earlier discussion on that topic (with very similar reactions):<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18094/games-emulating-kishotenketsu-plot-structure" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/forums/discussion/18094/games-emulating-kishotenketsu-plot-structure</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458475/#Comment_458475" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-01T18:57:09+00:00" title="December  1, 2016  6:57PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2016 6:58PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played Microscope and Montsegur, and although creating and resolving conflict certainly isn't the overall point of play, it <i>is</i> the process which keeps the fiction moving forward.  <br/><br/>Play without opposed characters?

You can AFFECT how it affects others.  GSS is about making that difference.  The car crash happens. Someone now has a dead parent.  How do they deal with that? How can you help them deal with that?<br/><br/>A man is sitting in a room waiting for a phone call that never comes.  Maybe no one likes his screenplay.  How can he move on from this situation?  How can you help him do so?<br/><br/>That is what the game is about, as clearly defined by its examples and its stated goals.  You seem to want it to be something it is not, and appear to be blaming my Western outlook for that fact.  Neither of these things is appropriate.\n<blockquote>Can you fail any of these four sentences? No, you can't unless you see it from a Westerner's eyes.

I'd like to offer, if I can, what I think the misunderstanding is here.  I will preface this by saying that I am not familiar with Golden Sky Stories, and am only attempting to address the examples given by Rickard.<br/><br/>I think any situation in which time passes (and possibly even situations in which time does not pass) could be framed in a way that implies conflict.  Even a tree standing in a field has conflict between its limbs and gravity.  I think the search here is not for examples of situations in life or games in which <i>conflict</i> is categorically absent, but for situations in which <i>resolution</i> of that conflict is not the object of the exercise.  Whether or not Golden Sky Stories is focused on resolution, I do think that Rickard's examples are adequate framings for situatiosn where resolution is not part of the exercise.<br/><br/>If the object of a hypothetical game is to explore the thoughts and feelings of a man in an empty apartment waiting for a call, we could still point to some conflict in the situation, but the resolution of that conflict has no bearing on the game.  Whether or not the call eventually comes, and what that might mean for his life, make no difference if the game is only about that time in which he is waiting.  The same applies for the other examples as well.  I think Airk has done a good job of pointing out that conflict is going to be at least implied in any situation, but maybe what Rickard is talking about is situations that aren't concerned with the <i>resolution</i> of that conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458484/#Comment_458484" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-01T21:27:15+00:00" title="December  1, 2016  9:27PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That seems pretty straightforward, thank you Rickdean.<br/><br/>All that said, to go back to Rickard's original comment of "I really hope that the game doesn't focus so much on conflicts though." - I feel a need to reiterate, since my point doesn't seem to be coming across: The game is absolutely about helping.  Helping implies looking for a resolution. That resolution could (indeed, often is) be something like "Help them find a good way to apologize" or "talk to them until they realize how they can move on." but the point of the game is that you are helpful animal spirits who help people in small ways.  This is not my "Western viewpoint looking for conflict in all situations" this is just the fact that the game isn't about what Rickard wants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458485/#Comment_458485" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-01T21:52:52+00:00" title="December  1, 2016  9:52PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> I think Airk has done a good job of pointing out that conflict is going to be at least implied in any situation, but maybe what Rickard is talking about is situations that aren't concerned with the <i>resolution</i> of that conflict.</blockquote>\nYou're spot on!\n<blockquote>This is not my "Western viewpoint looking for conflict in all situations" this is just the fact that the game isn't about what Rickard wants.</blockquote>\nAnd that is true too.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458497/#Comment_458497" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-02T07:51:27+00:00" title="December  2, 2016  7:51AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I cry a little every time someone hypes GSS, as it means they have wasted time playing it,  time that could have been spent with Witch Quest instead.
