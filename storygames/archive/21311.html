You play the here and now of your PC. You don't (because you <b>can't</b>) tell a tale as a Narrator / Storyteller / Director.<br/><b>Less plot planning = Less immersion breaking</b><br/>On the other hand, the system leverages the natural tendency of Players towards connecting dots and finding patterns in specific moments of the game:<br/><br/><i>C1 - the ninja trick</i><br/>Confused? don't know what to do next? Play a scene where your PC poses these very questions to someone! <b>This is an explicit game procedure</b> that helps Players turn all sorts of planning and brainstorming into in-fiction first-person roleplay, rather than having them stop the game and break immersion.<br/><br/><i>C2 - end of session ritual</i><br/>The game procedures require and encourage Players to wrap up every session with out-fiction speculation and brainstorming. What do you think is going on in the story? Are there unresolved matters and questions? What do you think the answers might be? What is the Invisible GM up to? What are you liking or disliking?<br/>This all happens <b>out-fiction</b> and <b>out-game</b>, as a simple and relaxed chat among Players that comment about and puzzle over what the GM has had them play. It does not decide anything, but helps ideas circulate, gently encouraging Players to look at the whole picture (as single specific events might appear jarring or mysterious) reinforcing the illusion that there is an external logic behind all that they have played through.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466724/#Comment_466724" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T22:55:27+00:00" title="September 30, 2017 10:55PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>D) Sedimentary Storytelling</i></b><br/>As a function of point C, the only thing that a Player can do story/plot wise is to just add details to what is happening in a specific scene, here and now, without ever defining big overarching truths.<br/>Grains of sand.<br/>Mainly coming from the direct actions of their own PC.<br/><b>Most of the time</b>, this will produce an effect similar to the one explained in point A but for the fiction rather than for the mechanics: "<i>OBVIOUSLY there is a fountain on the map!

Use the Revise mechanic! Advocate what YOU like about the game!<br/><br/>This translates in a tight game where everyone gets as close as what they want as possible while still granting the same to everyone else, with the side effect of SHOWING (thus teaching) to everyone what everyone else truly likes ... it teaches openness, listening and cooperation as a byproduct of being "egoistically honest".<br/>Usually Players are either already tuned to each other tastes, and the mechanics seldom kick in, only producing course correction if and when needed to keep the harmony and focus even over longer periods of play.<br/>Or they have a moment of initial high usage, as Players learn to know each other, and then fade to the background for the occasional course correction.<br/>Or they have the game break in a way that clearly shows the misbehaviour of a Player, allowing the group to solve (or at least face) the social problem on a clean social level, out-game.<br/><br/>This is the exact opposite of most gmLess structure that rely on common sense and social graces, encouraging everyone to be good and kind, to think of the others and their needs, etc... which I've often seen produce more shyness, more awkwardness, more social fear and pressure, as you don't want to impose yourself, you don't want to be the dick saying "I don't like this".<br/>And the more you hide your opinion and silence your critics, the harder it becomes to be honest at the table.<br/><br/>I've seen how hard it is for people to say "No" even with all the tools that FateLess provides, and how the more they use it, the easier they are to use, the better the resulting game is.<br/>THIS also is an important piece of the Invisible GM effect, as it makes the whole game tik better, thus reinforcing the feeling that the plot is solid and meaningful, just as if a very good GM had it tailored just for you in advance.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466726/#Comment_466726" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T23:22:43+00:00" title="September 30, 2017 11:22PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>E) The Illusion of Immersion</b><br/>By far and large the idea of play being "always" immersed in your PC is utter bullshit.<br/>Even in gmLed games, all the time a Player is sitting at a table, looking at a character sheet, rolling dice, thinking about game mechanics, and what time is it, and if they like what Malcom has just had his PC say and do, etc.<br/>Then the Player <b>also</b> imagines themselves looking out from their PC's eyes, or following their story as a very interactive audience. A Player can prefer this part of the game, sure, but it does not mean that all the rest is not there.<br/>Immersion is an illusion that has us selectively focus on one thing rather than another, nothing more. Different people are able to induce such self-suggestions in different ways, depending on their personal tastes and habits and whatnot ... this is why one table behaviour can be "immersive" for one Player while "immersion breaking" for another and absolutely neutral and irrelevant for some else.<br/><br/>By the same token when we play we are also always an "audience" for the other Players/PCs.<br/>In gmLed game you think about your PC, true, but when you engage with the SIS you automatically fill-in the blanks, or notice such blanks and feel the need to ask about them, or imagine abstractly what could be the meaning of the fiction... where it comes from, where it goes.<br/>You don't devote too much attention to this, you are immersing in your PC after all!, but it still happens.<br/><br/>FateLess tries to exploit this by having the Player give voice to such usually unvoiced ideas and questions.<br/>When the game requires SOMEONE to offer an input, it uses all the aforementioned tricks and mechanisms to see that someone at the table answers.<br/>Chances are that someone at the table will organically have a clear idea of the answer, thus it would feel OBVIOUS and perfectly natural to state what should be already clear to everyone.<br/>The magic is, if it IS obvious it works as reinforcement of the fiction: it makes sense, it is logical, we can depend on it and build upon it and exploit it.<br/>If it IS NOT obvious (and it often is not) you just surprised everyone else, and by virtue of the social procedures it will either feel "right" and enrich the game, or feel "wrong" and trigger the editing/harmonising mechanics ending up in a "right" result.<br/><br/>If one Player were always asked to provide all input, they would feel too much out-character.<br/>But making the input very small, and outsourcing it to whomever at the table feels comfortable answering to just this one specific thing right here and now... it feels like nothing.<br/>And the more you do, the more you get used to it, the more you end up contributing without feeling like breaking immersion.<br/><br/>Sometimes this illusion of an illusion tears a bit. Sometimes the game needs an input and no one is comfortable giving it, and even using the mechanical tools at your disposal SOMEONE will in the end HAVE TO spell out a clear answer.<br/>It can happen.<br/>But not as often as one might imagine. And the longer the game progresses, the more the Players subconsciously arrange the dots in their mind in the shape of an answer, until even the biggest reveal of the most complex mystery investigation becomes and easy(er) answer that doesn't really require breaking immersion. You're just stating what to you, by this point, makes perfect sense.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466727/#Comment_466727" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T23:36:51+00:00" title="September 30, 2017 11:36PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>F) The Illusion of GM preparation</b><br/>Finding solace in the presence of a GM that prepares a story beforehand is, also, another illusion.<br/>As a Player you can't see behind the GM screen.<br/>You can never know if what the GM says was carefully pre-planned weeks ago, or is an inspired improvisation of the moment.<br/><br/>Usually one can tell by the quality of it.<br/>But not always... GMs might be storytellers by vocation, but not necessarily by talent or trade... some planned stories are awful, while some improvised plots are pure genius.<br/>And it all usually affects the players much more by virtue of the Player <b>engagement</b> in whatever shit they have "lived" at the table, than because of the objective quality of the story/acting material.<br/><br/>This is the biggest trick of story-games... emergent play is naturally engaging, so even if the story is utter crap the Players will enjoy it immensely more than a best seller novel in which they have little or no buy-in.<br/><br/>The main difference in then in authority. You <b>trust</b> the GM to do their job.

Your discussion above gave me plenty of food for thought. <br/><br/>The overview and explanation you have here has really interested me. I think I'd need to first read through fate accelerated (i guess I'm just assuming that's the version your hack is based off of...), then I'd need to read the actual text of your game if I really wanted to figure out how your system might achieve the very worthy goals youve set for the game. Since my only opportunity to play games now limits me to single shots, I won't be able to give you playtest feedback, but if you want to share your writing with me, I could read through and give you that feedback. Since I've never played in the fate system, and since I'm unlikely to be able to playtest... maybe it wouldn't be worth it...  but let me know. <br/><br/>Your emphasis on immersion and playing the obvious, and your mechanic to discuss things between sessions took root in my brain (or germinated) and now I've got a new game idea growing.  The context is a small tribal group. Like your game I'm interested in cloaking the gm role within the fiction. The game involves 3 phases for each scene:  communal vision inducing rituals (players suggesting the direction of upcoming scenes, tribal council in which the options suggested are distilled down to provide a skeleton for the upcoming scene, and then scenes. I'm not very original so I hope you don't mind me taking inspiration from your work. I've adopted your goals of increasing immersion and having the gm role emerge organically. The story should evolve in small steps according to a kind of natural selection. That'd be the goal at least.  <br/><br/>I've added a quick sketch to my document of a dozen or so game ideas I have in various stages. Ha!  Not sure if this will peter out or take root and grow, but I'll let you know if it does  <br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/>Davey.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466749/#Comment_466749" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-02T09:42:24+00:00" title="October  2, 2017  9:42AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Feel free to draw ideas <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>All my games are under CC license exactly to allow people to use them as they please for their own designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466751/#Comment_466751" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-02T15:32:19+00:00" title="October  2, 2017  3:32PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2017 5:15PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a>, you've  convinced me to try FateLess.

It makes little sense to you? It hurts your vision of the game? SAY SO! Use the Revise mechanic! Advocate what YOU like about the game!<br/><br/>This translates in a tight game where everyone gets as close as what they want as possible while still granting the same to everyone else, with the side effect of SHOWING (thus teaching) to everyone what everyone else truly likes ... it teaches openness, listening and cooperation as a byproduct of being "egoistically honest".<br/>Usually Players are either already tuned to each other tastes, and the mechanics seldom kick in, only producing course correction if and when needed to keep the harmony and focus even over longer periods of play.<br/>Or they have a moment of initial high usage, as Players learn to know each other, and then fade to the background for the occasional course correction.<br/>Or they have the game break in a way that clearly shows the misbehaviour of a Player, allowing the group to solve (or at least face) the social problem on a clean social level, out-game.<br/><br/>This is the exact opposite of most gmLess structure that rely on common sense and social graces, encouraging everyone to be good and kind, to think of the others and their needs, etc... which I've often seen produce more shyness, more awkwardness, more social fear and pressure, as you don't want to impose yourself, you don't want to be the dick saying "I don't like this".<br/>And the more you hide your opinion and silence your critics, the harder it becomes to be honest at the table.<br/><br/>I've seen how hard it is for people to say "No" even with all the tools that FateLess provides, and how the more they use it, the easier they are to use, the better the resulting game is.<br/>THIS also is an important piece of the Invisible GM effect, as it makes the whole game tik better, thus reinforcing the feeling that the plot is solid and meaningful, just as if a very good GM had it tailored just for you in advance"</b></i></b>.<br/><br/>This is an important observation and many don't think it is a option worth considering; games and audiences are not the same and different solutions work for different tastes and goals. Many designers just assume that it is an unwritten rule that if anyone's contribution to the game is even slightly modified that you are taking away their creativity or hurting their feelings\u2014Archipelago being an exception\u2014meanwhile, many other players may be unsatisfied with the story and no one feels comfortable talking about their dissatisfaction or discussing issues generally, and resentment can quietly grow toward others; for example, the most gonzo player(s), etc. This especially happens if the group are not friends to begin with and don't feel comfortable airing any dissatisfaction. Sometimes people don't pick up on social cues, even after a very long time, and they are acting with goodwill but unwittingly can affecting others enjoyment of the game; I think that having a mechanic to arbitrate can't be worthwhile for some designs. Also, in GMless games there is no GM to reign-in and adjust differences in the narrative tone and people are improving, so there may need to be subtle mechanics for making slight adjustments. It took about about nine months, playing weekly, for our group of regulars to realize that nearly everyone at SG SLC was not satisfied with many, if not the majority, of the stories we were creating, because they were being derailed and lacking in verisimilitude because of whimsical humor that drifted from the desired tone of a given story.  It's not about blaming anyone, it's about everyone looking at their contributions and seeing how those contributions affect others. There are sessions where gonzo, whimsical humor and lack of verisimilitude are great, but this is not the case with every session. If there is even a little bit of an augmentation, rarely, of a player's contribution, even if it is for the satisfaction of the entire group, this is seen as a trespass by many designers.  And they have their arguments, and they are designing their games for certain audience, and I'm not going to say for a second that they are designing in the wrong way; I'm just saying that there are other options that are valid. Often, the social outcomes of not having a way to slightly modify contributions creates a more dysfunctional social environment then having a way to gently do so. I might add that I'm talking solely about collaborative GMless Story Games in this regard, and that it is important that, even objectively, a player's contribution isn't "wrong," it is just something that interferes with another player's enjoyment of the game. No one is "wrong", it is just as much about the player(s) who  ask the player to adjust their contributions lately, as it is about the player and narrated the contribution. Besides who wants to interfere with another person's enjoyment of the game? Why not make a small compromise if it is reasonable? It isn't about pointing out "bad" contributions, it's about sharing the story in a way that everyone can enjoy it. It's also important that asking someone "to try another way" is not used in an arbitrary way that is just enforcing one players creative taste over anothers or attempting to monopolize the story;  this, is of coarse, an abuse of the mechanic. The reasonable times to employ the mechanic should be made explicit in the game. In most games, if the mechanic is used, it should be confined to when something seriously goes outside the agreed upon tone (which is established prior to the game), or seriously disrupts the verisimilitude when this is unappropriate given the story's tone. Mickey Mouse shouldn't show up in a Game of Thrones episode, for example. Everyone is different, and enjoy's sessions with different tones, so it's also important to provide different sessions that accommodate different players tastes and needs and respects those needs, so that the majority doesn't always make those with minor tastes unable to play there type of game. The "try another way" technique also helps to train people socially so that they can accommodate others  tastes, and in time, is needed very rarely.

That's all. It's a sort of resolution that uses a "task trigger" to then produce "conflict outcomes". It's easier played than explained XD<br/><br/>Also, the difficulty of the test is set by the fiction: roll 1d6 minus 1d6 plus Rating (old Skill or new Way) vs a difficulty of...<br/>... 2 is always the minimum<br/>... +2 if the action is inherently crazy difficult<br/>... +2 if external elements are actively hindering your action<br/>... +2 if the action would directly resolve a Goal<br/><br/>What usually happens, barred blind luck with the dice, is a naturally outcome of FAIL or TIE that is then modified by either spending Fate Points or accepting a Cost.<br/><br/>So, as you can see, if a Player wants an action to succeed... it will... no doubt.<br/>But it will have all sorts of side effects, consequences and costs, which in turn have the game (and story) spin ahead meaningfully and dramatically.<br/><br/>Not sure if this fits in your idea of "grit" but in general there is really no point in lowering the starting amount of Skill/Way points.<br/><br/><b>-<br/>--<br/>---<br/>put a cap on skill scores<br/>---<br/>--<br/>-</b><br/><br/>Both Skills and Ways systems have max creation ratings of +3 and then +5 with development.<br/>You usually have more "high" Skills but only in specialised areas.<br/>You usually have fewer "high" Ways but their application is broader.<br/>As before, lowering these caps should not really be useful to achieve the grittiness you mention.<br/><br/><b>-<br/>--<br/>---<br/>lower the refresh rate<br/>---<br/>--<br/>-</b><br/><br/>There is no such thing in FateLess <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>If you start a session with no Fate, you gain 1 Fate.<br/>That's all.<br/>The game relies on other sources of Fate points for its economy:<br/>- Damn!<br/>- Compel an Aspect<br/>- suffer a Hindrance at the hands of another Player (aka, when they Invoke an aspect to give you a -2 on the roll ... which might soon go away as I've never seen it used in my life)<br/><br/><b>-<br/>--<br/>---<br/>have less stress boxes<br/>---<br/>--<br/>-</b><br/><br/>There is no such thing in FateLess <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>A PC can withstand 3 Consequences (aspects) which "only" affect <i>fictional positioning</i>.<br/>(spoiler alert, in FateLess fictional positioning is effing important)<br/>At the 4th Consequence suffered, the PC is Taken Out... which puts the fate of the PC into the table's hands, death included.<br/><br/>Consequences are suffered from mechanical effects. True. But also by <b>simple fictional positioning</b>.<br/>This means that if anyone "just" describes a drunken knight swinging his sword at you... either you do something to avoid it (and succeed) or you get wounded. Just like that. And that's a Consequence.<br/>Same goes for social or mental ones.<br/>And Consequences take time (game sessions) or Significant Milestones to heal.<br/><br/>Again, it might not fit the classical idea of "high lethality" so I'm not sure if the end feeling is what you are looking for.<br/><br/><b>-<br/>--<br/>---<br/>put a cap on stacking aspects in a given scene<br/>---<br/>--<br/>-</b><br/><br/>Never been a problem.<br/>Each Aspect can be Invoked only once per Test (not scene).<br/>But you don't usually have tons of Fate points.<br/>And even if you do, it doesn't ruin the game... as pointed out before, the mechanics use the NATURAL test to have stuff happen, and the MODIFIED test only to set the final outcome.<br/><br/>So yeah, you might spend a bunch of Fate to invoke a bunch of Aspects and score a WwStyle without sweating.<br/>But Opposition effects (think something like PbtA Hard Moves from the Invisible GM) can and will still hit you no matter what.<br/><br/>The overall game structure makes the problem a moot point :P <br/><br/><b>-<br/>--<br/>---<br/>What would your suggestions be to adjust the game for a Game of Thrones type campaign and do you think you could do so?<br/>---<br/>--<br/>-</b><br/><br/>Do absolutely nothing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Unless your idea of what a GoT story looks like is wildly different from mine, then FateLess naturally produces it.<br/>The setting of GoT is also unchallenging for the system, as there are no intricate sub-systems (like magic or high technology) that need simulating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466755/#Comment_466755" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-02T18:12:39+00:00" title="October  2, 2017  6:12PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK.

I think it is most often about taste and nature.<br/><br/>Simple question for folks: is it appropriate for Micky Mouse to show up in a Game of Thrones game with serious themes.

But we have had contributions that reduced other players enjoyment of the game and other people have spoken to me about it, and these contributions seem to have a similar nature. <br/><br/>The general consensus I've heard from players is that it is not a problem of "genre."  It is a problem of "tone" and "verisimilitude."  Sometimes people want to have a serious,  more dramatic game. They have said that when we try to have a serious game that contains a more realistic tone, that the tone and the verisimilitude of the game go off the tracks. Basically, that the tone and verisimilitude are often undermined by silly, farcical, screwball, situational humor; as well as, absurd and unlikely things happening. This type of tone may work well for a Fiasco game, but it may not be a good fit for Montsegur 1244. People want sessions that very in tone and sometimes they want a more serious game. I think we've had those games to a point, but people clearly want more of them and want their tone to be more consistent. The issue we've been having, from my perspective and what I've gathered from others, is that people would like to have some serious and dramatic games and that introducing silly, absurd, and unlikely things are getting in the way of that, for some folks.<br/><br/>It's not like this is a crazy interpretation of an issue in a GMless game. Would you be happy going to a game in which the GM routinely created poor stories you didn't like? Why should a story matter any less in a GMless game, why isn't it reasonable that poor stories effect players' satisfaction with the game.  People have different tastes and different reasons for gaming. Not all people game for strictly social reasons, so it makes sense that different games have different goals to accommodate different people.  Anyway, that's how I see it.  For some reason the counter position has been the status quo, and I don't think it necessarily holds up to critique. I think there's room for both models and the grays in between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466766/#Comment_466766" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-03T03:48:16+00:00" title="October  3, 2017  3:48AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2017 5:02AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" rel="nofollow">Hasimir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>A closer source of inspiration was, instead, the <b>HowAbout</b> mechanic in Sebastian Hickey's <b>Hell For Leather</b>.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThis sounds promising.

setting, genre and tone being played. I use something similar in spanish; it works in a similar way to saying "yes, but..." to player's input, in the sense that you're not blocking them, you're still using their input as much as you can, but adapting it into something that doesn't disrupt the fiction. <br/><br/>Like, if someone says Mickey Mouse shows up on a somewhat medieval realistic setting you can describe it as someone's non-talking cute pet that looks <a href="https://dfep0xlbws1ys.cloudfront.net/thumbs37/55/3755703dc427557a7109a5e99674eeea.jpg?response-cache-control=max-age=2628000" rel="nofollow">like this</a> and go on dealing with the implications.<br/><br/>I'm used to deal with players that try this sort of input. It's usually people who aren't yet aboard the RPG train or the game theme, who got dragged to it by someone else and think they will either not enjoy the experience, so they offer some gonzo input when they are asked, as a way of dealing with the pressure in a sort of passive-aggresive self-defense stance. They expect their answers to show whoever asked for their input that the thing won't work despit their enthusiasm. But then, if you take their answer head-on seriously and start building upon it on the spot, their attitude changes completely: they will start to edit themselves and even put an effort to bring better quality material to the table. <br/><br/>The key however is that first input. If you just block that player you will have proven their point and given them more reasons to find an excuse to get out or keep the gonzo going if they can't get out. But, editing their input and adding it into the game makes them feel compromised instead and you could even see some of them trying to take back on whatever they say and change it for something more connected to the setting, genre and themes of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466911/#Comment_466911" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-10T09:37:07+00:00" title="October 10, 2017  9:37AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's what often happens.<br/><br/>In rare occasions I saw players harshly self-censor themselves... like... they lay down an "off" idea, and see it reviewed, and as a reaction completely retract it "<i>Never mind, do as if I said nothing.</i>" ... but then usually it's everyone else encouraging them "<i>Wait! It's cool!

Haven't had much S-G time lately.  Here are my first impressions:<br/><br/>- The ability (and need) for players to author not just the characters' actions but the situations they encounter (saying "obviously!" doesn't make the difference between no guards, two guards, and thirty guards any less important) immediately puts FateLess into "GMful play" territory.  "Just play your character!" would be misleading to most people who actually prioritize that goal.<br/><br/>- From that GMful starting point, FateLess has a lot of great techniques to minimize the GMing burden on players.<br/><br/>-- "Quoth the Die" sounds very important to me, depending on the rules or guidelines governing when it gets used.  What are those?<br/><br/>-- "Don't create for offscreen" also sounds extremely important.  Yeah, we're making up the buildings our characters are walking through, but we're not authoring the histories of the corporations that own them.  Those details stay unknown to us just as they're unknown to our characters.  Excellent.<br/><br/>-- Resolving conflicts about how the game should go quickly and in a manner that everyone can accept sounds like the proper approach to me.  How do Revise and Dissent achieve this?<br/><br/>Aside from those first impressions, I have three major questions:<br/><br/>1) What's at stake in FateLess?  Is it whether the PCs can attain their goals?  Is it what attaining their goals looks like?  Is it who they become, or reveal themselves to be, in the process?  <br/><br/>-- I ask because if the level of practical obstacle the PCs face is irrelevant, then our GMful decisions become much less weighty, and I can improvise 2 guards or 30 guards without any struggle between intuition and advantage.  <br/><br/>-- If, on the other hand, "2 guards" means I can probably achieve my goal and "30 guards" means I probably can't, then my GMful decisions are complicated by any degree of investment I have in my character's success.  In my experience with such play, players lose character identification in favor of enjoying the "make up cool stories" social activity, as attempting the opposite is just too frustrating.<br/><br/>2) Are all the PCs in each other's scenes or not?  Am I playing my PC 100% of the time, or (in a 4-player game) 25% of the time, or something else?<br/><br/>3) Do you ever roleplay conversations between PCs and NPCs?  If so, who plays the NPCs?<br/><br/>On the philosophical front, I agree with much of what you've written about traditional play, and I also agree that we generally have the ability, mentally, to pursue a character focus when we really want to, and to minimize things that can distract us from that.  I think that's a fine attitude for a GMless game to support, and think FateLess is a super cool project on that front!  <br/><br/>If I'm right about the desired attitude, and if I played it accordingly, I'd probably roll a lot and invent as little as possible.  I get the impression from your description that that's permitted but not expected, correct?<br/><br/>If Revise/Dissent are super quick, and I have no input into my own obstacles, I bet I'd enjoy it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466933/#Comment_466933" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-11T00:11:47+00:00" title="October 11, 2017 12:11AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most excellent considerations David. <br/>I'll be interested to hear the responses. <br/><br/>This game and this discussion is getting more interesting to me. I think I better really look at it (if I may). <br/><br/>So, Hasimir, if I refreshed myself on fate accelerated (or is your game based on Core?) and read your hack, I may have something worthwhile to say (maybe). Would you share your file?  Maybe you already have. Other members comments make it clear that they have read your hack already. <br/><br/>David, i agree and think it a very good insight that by privileging the question of who the characters are or become in the story, over concrete attainments we create a game that sidesteps so many messy crunch issues that are very difficult to address in a gmLess game. Not saying it can't be done or at lest the issues can be ameliorated through innovative design, but this one insight goes a long way toward explaining why so many gmLess games do not focus on goal attainment.  <br/><br/>I'm wondering what the exceptions are  to the generalization I just made...  I'm thinking fateless is an attempt in that general direction.  <br/><br/>Hasimir, please let me know if and how I may read your work so I as to enter more fully into this discussion. <br/><br/>And, should I refamiliarize myself with accelerated or core?  <br/><br/>Many thanks for all your creative thought,<br/><br/>Davey. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466945/#Comment_466945" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-11T16:00:12+00:00" title="October 11, 2017  4:00PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/davey">@davey</a> thanks a lot for the interest <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>FateLess is not a <b>Fate</b> hack, unless you intend it in the most loose sense possible.<br/>Yes, it started out using Fate as a basic framework, and it still retains a few familiar elements within it (Aspects, Milestones, etc).<br/>But the game structure and procedures are radically different.<br/>You don't need any previous knowledge of Fate Core nor Fate Accelerated.<br/>Heck, being used to Fate might actually be a bit of a hindrance during the initial learning phase, as you might bump into elements that look familiar but actually work differently.<br/><br/>The only thing you need to play FateLess is FateLess.<br/>Now, about that... you asked openly so I will reply openly.<br/>The game is not free.<br/>The current version (using the <i>Skill Tree</i>) <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/151493/FateLess" rel="nofollow">is available on DriveThruRPG</a>.<br/>The new version (using the <i>Ways to Action</i>) <a href="https://www.patreon.com/unPlayableGames" rel="nofollow">is available in the Playtest folder to my Patreons</a>.<br/>The DDR files will be updated to the Patreon version once the playtesting finishes, but there is still no official date for that.<br/>All that said, <a href="https://unplayablegames.blogspot.de/" rel="nofollow">in my blog</a> I openly encourage prople to "steal" my games (which is actually legal, as all my games have Creative Common licensing).<br/>So, because of convoluted ideological reasons, I won't directly hand you the game, but it shouldn't be too hard to put your hands on it if you really want to, one way or the other <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466946/#Comment_466946" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-11T16:00:57+00:00" title="October 11, 2017  4:00PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>\n<blockquote>-- "Quoth the Die" sounds very important to me, depending on the rules or guidelines governing when it gets used. What are those?</blockquote>\nThis is the text from the rulebook...\n<blockquote>To do it you say aloud \u201c<i>Quoth!</i>\u201d. This calls a <b>Pause</b> and tells the other Players you want to ask a question to a die. Formulate a Yes/No question and make it as specific as possible, explaining clearly what you mean. Again, the only possible answers are bound to what the PCs can perceive right here and now. Then roll one die: odd means No, even means Yes.<br/><br/>Feel free to add further details to weave the answer into the fiction, or to ask more Yes/No questions to produce, bit by bit, a satisfying description. A chain of Quoth is a very effective way to produce unexpected and interesting results.</blockquote>\nPause is another mechanics, here is how it works by the book...\n<blockquote>Sometimes the game conversation can get a bit hectic and the resulting fiction unclear. Or someone may try to fast-talk her way through the game. This is not fun, so at any time you can raise your hands and say \u201cPause!\u201d.<br/><br/>The game must stop so that everyone has time to ask questions and clarifications, offer ideas to the table and generally clear the air. The fiction established just before the Pause must be renegotiated to account for any misunderstanding and incomprehension. Pause ends when everyone agrees to resume.<br/><br/>Don\u2019t debate!<br/>Ask questions and offer answers, but if an actual argument arises stop it using the other Ritual Words to cut the crap.</blockquote>\nThis means the Quoth can be called at any time. And can even supersede spontaneous Player input. So if I simply say that it is raining, you can call a Quoth to have the die determine if it rains or not.<br/><br/>In 90% of the cases this all happens very smoothly, as part of the normal game conversation around the table. The full and verbose text of the rules is there to help in the remaining 10% of cases, when someone is somehow doing something screwy.\n<blockquote>Resolving conflicts about how the game should go quickly and in a manner that everyone can accept sounds like the proper approach to me.

There is a tree all right, but not a palm, it's too tropical."<br/>The end.<br/>The tree can't be a palm. Period. We come up with a more fitting kind of tree and move along.<br/><br/>Of course the game text explains this more fully, but you get the gist.<br/><b>Dissent</b> is an actual auction meant to settle deeper divergences about how things should be in the game world.<br/>Players will briefly express their vision, then go turn by turn bidding Fate points, one at a time. Not everyone needs to be involved, and once you pass you are out for good.<br/>All bids are real... so if you bid 3 points and then pass or loose, those points are gone no matter what. This way you can't fake-bid just to troll and inflate the final pay out.<br/>It is possible to bid more Fate than you have... this puts you in "debt" with the game, which means that all Fate you earn from now on will instantly vanish to pay up your debt.<br/><br/>In my experience, the Revise comes up as much or as little as needed to put Players in sync with each other, then unobtrusively vanishes in the background, reappearing only briefly here and there to keep everyone on track.<br/>Dissent is used much more rarely, but when you need it, it's there and does its job egregiously.<br/><br/>Yesterday I was playing my second session of <b>The Veil</b> and I would have given a leg and and arm to have a similar mechanic in place... we spent ONE HOUR debating, and getting progressively angrier at each other, about how the damned Veil worked, by default, in regards of chip-less people.

Which in turn means setting and character exploration. Goals are there as the finer and most specific part of this path, and as such they are tools that give the Character (thus the Player) direction.<br/>You care to accomplish your Goals because you care for your PC because you care for the game Issues.<br/><br/>In my view this means that achieving your personal Goals is indeed a <b>BIG</b> part of your game experience. It gives you both direction and drive. But it's not the underlying final goal.<br/>Just as you can and will face obstacles and challenges, but "winning" is not the point of the game. At least, not like it is in a skill-based challenge-oriented Old School design.<br/>It's more akin to Apocalypse World.<br/>Failure and death are real dangers, and you can (and should) advocate for your PC's success, but in the end you sit at the table <b>mainly</b> to see what happens next, to explore setting, character and plot.<br/><br/>That said...\n<blockquote>"2 guards" means I can probably achieve my goal and "30 guards" means I probably can't</blockquote>\nThis.<br/>The level of practical obstacle, the fictional positioning of the whole situation, <b>does make a difference</b>.<br/><br/>But you don't have to be the one setting it up, if you're not comfortable with it or prefer a different play experience.<br/>Anyone else at the table can define such things for you, just because they seem obvious and sensible to them.<br/>Or you can Quoth the die to know if there are guards, if there is more than one, if they are a few or many, etc.<br/>Or anyone might set such details in order to activate a mechanic (maybe Compelling and Aspect, maybe throwing a Damn! in the mix hoping to scrounge 1 Fate point for themselves).<br/>Or as a consequence of a roll you accrue enough Opposition points to activate a Hard Opposition effect...and then describing guards or sharks or shark-guards is just a matter of dressing up with appropriate fiction a hard mechanical fact you can't wiggle away from <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>And anyway, actually achieving a Goal is fundamentally a coin toss.<br/>If you care about it, the only way to increase your chance of success, even to a safe 100%, is to face a lot of obstacle on the way there, to do lots of stuff, to research and investigate and plan and then take action and gather resources and prepare and... and at the end of it all if you hit a 100% chance of success and put yourself in the needed fictional positioning to achieve the Goal... well then it is well deserved, and everyone has had a blast, and the game has done its job <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>On another level, as the game is focused on individuals, the other players will have no qualms in playing opposition for you.<br/>But even if the PCs end up together, as a team with a common goal, there is enough automation that in the game that they will face sensible challenges no matter what. A single guard can be a meaningful obstacle, and each roll can generate interesting and unexpected (and inconvenient) outcomes in addition to a mere Win/Fail result.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, I have noticed in time how most people, especially those that really care a lot about "the win", tend to:<br/>- react badly to cheating, or what they perceive as an "undeserved" victory<br/>- give high value to "realism" or whatever passes for it<br/><br/>So you <b>can</b> say there is just one guard. You can even say there are no guards at all. Chances are that, with almost no conscious effort, someone else will react with a fix for that...<br/>"<i>No guards? Pfffft... more like a small regiment of guards organised in groups of three, walking the perimeter on a routine path every 30 minutes.</i>" <img alt=":naughty:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title=":naughty:"/> <br/><br/>The prompt here is not the "weak player" desire to ramp up drama, so common in many shared-story games. It's the good old need for stuff that "makes sense" to you. Very powerful and ingrained in pretty much anyone I know; the only caveat is you need social structures to handle divergence of opinion.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466948/#Comment_466948" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-11T16:01:40+00:00" title="October 11, 2017  4:01PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>2) Are all the PCs in each other's scenes or not?

Although I personally advise against playing on more than 5.<br/><br/>When your PC is present in a scene, you play your PC and are expected to participate in the other needed activities however you see fit.<br/>Same caveats apply here as before.\n<blockquote>3) Do you ever roleplay conversations between PCs and NPCs?

Especially if their PCs are off screen. This sometimes carries on also in future scene, but sometimes not, so that different Players end but being the main voice for the same NPC at different times in the game.<br/><br/>Another technique I've seen emerge at some tables is that someone Quoths the die to get the hard info needed, then they or someone else dresses it up into a nicer dialogue form.\n<blockquote>I'd probably roll a lot and invent as little as possible.

So we have a whole class of pauses which mean it's time to look critically at the fiction for a sec, or at least halt the current momentum.  This is often done to communicate what's what in the fiction before proceeding (Pause), but sometimes it's done when a player has a yes/no question they'd like a die roll to answer (Quoth), a hard objection to some trivial content (Revise), or the occasional serious disagreement (Dissent).  For serious disagreements, the person with the most points they're willing to spend gets their way.<br/><br/>How are these points earned?  Is it by providing some sort of valuable/valued contribution to the group?  If so, this makes sense to me.<br/><br/>I have pondered using systems like these in the past, but in games where they didn't fit.  For example, in a game striving for realism, letting the player with the most points make the call seemed off.  Similarly, in a character-POV game, letting metagame currency arbitrate in-fiction arguments between characters seemed off.  But I'm not seeing these problems in FateLess -- I don't see a specific ethos players are supposed to uphold with their contributions to the fiction, and I don't see any avoidance of metagame influences on the fiction.  So if I'm reading all this correctly, it sounds good to me!<br/><br/>For my group, I imagine that putting this all on the table before play would set expectations very nicely for the expected style of collaboration.  The vibe I'm getting is "play nice together, but don't be afraid to advocate for what you think is best -- we can disagree in good faith and then see who wins and move along."  Right?<br/><br/>In general, I think this set of ritual words has a lot of potential for "everyone's making stuff up" play (usually GMless, but maybe GMed too).  I'd be skeptical about getting genuine buy-in for parts of this from players of many common RPG backgrounds, but if you say it has consistently worked for you, that increases my optimism!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467058/#Comment_467058" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T01:50:16+00:00" title="October 17, 2017  1:50AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2017 1:58AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Challenge stuff:<br/><br/>Okay, cool.  Play isn't one big challenge, but we do pursue our characters' success and care about their apparent odds.  <br/><br/>It sounds to me from your description of facing prior obstacles and bumping success percentages that said odds are determined by game procedures and mechanics, not by the whims of whoever's describing an obstacle.  Is that correct?<br/><br/>If so, then some of my questions become irrelevant, but I'll have new ones.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Whatever the answer is, I think I'm still fuzzy on this part:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" rel="nofollow">Hasimir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So you <b>can</b> say there is just one guard. You can even say there are no guards at all. Chances are that, with almost no conscious effort, someone else will react with a fix for that...<br/>"<i>No guards?

It's the good old need for stuff that "makes sense" to you. Very powerful and ingrained in pretty much anyone I know; the only caveat is you need social structures to handle divergence of opinion.</p></div></blockquote>That doesn't match my experience at all.  I have never seen one player with complete discretion make a decision that was bad news for another player's character and have either player parse that as pursuit of "what makes sense".  Either they're both supposed to care about "what makes sense", in which case they're now at odds about who's playing correctly, or they aren't supposed to care, in which case "30 guards makes sense!" is dishonest antagonism.<br/><br/>I see no problem at all with <i>honest</i> antagonism, as your little devil face might indicate, but I'm not sure how that's different than the "ramp up drama" urge that it sounds like you dislike ("weak player" sounds negative to me).<br/><br/>The Dissent system sounds to me like everyone is encouraged to have a creative vision and to advocate for it.  Perhaps the best answer to, "Why do you want 30 guards instead of zero?" is, "Because I feel like it!  That's the scene I want to see!  Do you want to spend the points to stop me?"  <br/><br/>I feel like I'm probably incorrect on that last bit, but I'm not sure exactly why.  Care to clue me in?<br/><br/>Final note:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" rel="nofollow">Hasimir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But you don't have to be the one setting it up, if you're not comfortable with it or prefer a different play experience.<br/>Anyone else at the table can define such things for you, just because they seem obvious and sensible to them.</p></div></blockquote>Works for me.  It does sound like I'm pushing a little GM burden onto the other players, though.  Good thing Quoth is there for them if they're not up to it!  Or, at least, I think it is...  personally, I don't think I'd have trouble coming up with good yes/no questions to ask a die, but I wonder how universal that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467060/#Comment_467060" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T02:13:16+00:00" title="October 17, 2017  2:13AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2017 2:16AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for playing PCs in turns and otherwise participating in GM tasks and NPC play, that all sounds fun to me, but in a way that recalls my memories of GMful play.  Partly that's just my own taste, though -- I know that playing my PC primarily and near-continuously is more key to my traditional-style RPG fun than it is to some others'.<br/><br/>On a related note, I'm curious about the expected degree of group participation in FateLess.  Let's say that my PC is the only one in a scene.  How much are the other players expected to talk?  Are they mostly silent?  Are they providing feedback to my every statement, in the form of my character's environment, NPCs etc.?  I assume the latter -- which is part of what strikes me as GMful -- but I figure I should ask rather than assume.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks for fielding all these questions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467068/#Comment_467068" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T12:23:30+00:00" title="October 17, 2017 12:23PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the stimulating questions!  <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/>I like doing this kind of stuff because it requires me to deeply analyse and put into understandable words elements and concepts that would otherwise be "a fuzzy feeling" in my head.<br/>On to your questions...<br/><br/>-<br/>-<br/>-\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For serious disagreements, the person with the most points they're willing to spend gets their way.<br/>How are these points earned?

Only if you begin a session with zero, then you are awarded 1 Fate.<br/>Such activities are:<br/><br/>- use the Damn! mechanic (by which you inject Soft Opposition in a scene and then have a 50-50 chance to earn one Fate, or to grant one Fate to whoever is not yourself and has the less points)<br/><br/>- accept a Compel<br/><br/>- suffer a Hindrance (when someone Invokes an Aspect to give you -2 ... but I'm keen on removing this options, as mentioned before)<br/><br/>Fate is used for all the things you would expect normally, and more:<br/>- Invoke an Aspect (to get a +2, or to reroll, or to hinder and give a -2)<br/>- Refuse a Compel<br/>- Enter a Scene (if your PC was not framed in it)<br/>- Steal a Scene<br/>- Dissent<br/><br/>As a result Fate points are not scarce, but not abundant either.<br/>Dissent mechanics can burn lots of them all in one go, thus are very expensive if left unchecked; squandering Fate directly limits your future influence over the game, until you can work up again a small stash of Fate points.<br/><br/>This is why I usually see Dissent only ramp up to 1 or 2 Fate before a resolution is found.<br/>The net effect is to quickly establish who <b>cares more</b> about establishing an X thing.<br/>In my experience, everyone is willing to argue until the end of time.<br/>Not everyone is willing to put money where their mouth is.<br/>If you care, you pay. If you care enough, you pay enough. Whomever cares more, gets his way.<br/>It's a very powerful way to cut to the chase.<br/>Especially because it often helps Players face the fact that, after all, they <b>did not care</b> that much for this X thing we are debating, so it does not hurt/cost them to concede it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467069/#Comment_467069" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T12:24:02+00:00" title="October 17, 2017 12:24PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2017 12:26PM by Hasimir.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In a game striving for realism, letting the player with the most points make the call seemed off.<br/><br/>Similarly, in a character-POV game, letting metagame currency arbitrate in-fiction arguments between characters seemed off.</p></div></blockquote>\nThat is not how things work.<br/><br/><b><i>letting the player with the most points make the call</i></b><br/><br/>This is not the case. In a Dissent everyone has, virtually, the same amount of Fate. You can spend more than you have, and pay it up later as "debt". So if you and me Dissent on something, but at the moment you have zero Fate and I have 5, you still can participate and even outbid me.<br/>Two outcomes are possible thanks to this system:<br/><br/>1) one of us will give up and concede because they feel that the expenditure, beyond a certain threshold, is not worth it anymore... you discover that you don't care <i>this much</i> for this one detail<br/><br/>2) the situation gets obviously out of hand and ridiculous, with stupidly high bids that tend to infinity (because the system allows it).<br/>This is actually a "positive" result, as it polarises everyone's attention on a dysfunctional behaviour, showing that there is a deeper social problem between people, rather than a game problem between players.<br/>The rules clearly instruct players to look out for this occurrences, and to then stop the game, get out of it, and talk it out as people and friends, not as players and characters.<br/>"<i>You two are behaving like assholes. Why? Can we help? What's the <b>real</b> matter? How can we fix it?</i>"<br/><br/><b><i>letting metagame currency arbitrate in-fiction arguments between characters</i></b><br/><br/>Again, not the case.<br/>In-fiction arguments are solved in-fiction.<br/><br/>Arguments between a PC and another PC are solved by a Test, as your PC tries to overcome my PC.<br/><br/>Arguments between a PC and an NPC are solved in the same way. Your PC overcomes that NPC.<br/><br/>Arguments between an NPC and another NPC don't usually matter enough to really pit one Player against another. So they are solved by simple narration or maybe a Quoth, with a sprinkle of Revise to really align everyone's view.<br/>Dissent is rarely used, but then it does not set an in-fiction argument, but an out-fiction creative divergence <b>about</b> some fictional element.<br/><br/>One example could be...<br/><br/>A - My PC asks the girl (NPC) out.<br/>B - She says no.<br/>C - I would rather her say yes.<br/>B - No.<br/>C - Yes.<br/>B - Well I said no first, do you Dissent?<br/>C - err... no?<br/>B - then shut up.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>B - Well I said no first, do you Dissent?<br/>C - Hell yeah, 1 Fate!<br/>B - Enough for me, "yes" it is then.<br/><br/>etc...<br/><br/>Notice how this is just about setting <b>the basic attitude</b> of the girl. The starting point upon which a PC can then take action. Not the final outcome of a PC interaction.<br/>It's completely out-fiction. <b>It's the GM making up their mind about an arbitrary element of the fiction</b>. When the situation is obvious and there is no conflict of views, this operation happens under the surface, unobtrusively.<br/>When there is conflict, then the Players take a step back from the game to solve the conflict.<br/><br/>Another example could be...<br/><br/>There is a tense situation.<br/>Someone describes "<i>...and then Guards come and see you!</i>"<br/>You don't like it.<br/>By Revise you would still have guardas coming and seeing us, just described in a different way.<br/>So you Dissent.<br/>No, guards are not coming, or are coming but don't automatically see us.<br/><br/>Dissent is a high level authoring tool.<br/>It's used rarely because it is rarely necessary.<br/>It's a universal password to communicating that something rubs you off the wrong way at such a fundamental level that it considerably reduces your ability to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the game.<br/><br/>[It's worth noting how Dissent is <b>not</b> able to modify the rules of the game. If the girl says no, or guards arrive and see you, because of some mechanical effect, then no amount of Dissent could stop those occurrences from happening.]<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467070/#Comment_467070" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T12:24:19+00:00" title="October 17, 2017 12:24PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2017 12:27PM by Hasimir.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>the "ramp up drama" urge that it sounds like you dislike ("weak player" sounds negative to me)</p></div></blockquote>\nI don't dislike the inclination to drama.

And that Players usually lack inner clarity, they don't know what they want, and when they try to express it they often misscommunicate.<br/><br/>What the design of FateLess does is to help people <b>navigate through</b> this sea of emerging drives, avoiding or smoothing out frictions and collisions moment by moment, as they appear right before your eyes.<br/><br/>So it doesn't matter <b>why</b> you came up with 30 guards, as long as it <b>feels</b> OK to me.<br/>And when it doesn't, we have tools to navigate towards a mutually satisfying satisfying solution.<br/><br/>Usually this means a few and unobtrusive micro adjustments.<br/>Sometimes it means a bigger and more drastic, but very needed, course correction.<br/><br/>Also, this approach kind of makes the issue of honesty a moot point.<br/>Maybe I describe 30 guards because it honestly makes sense to me.<br/>Maybe I describe 30 guards because I have an interest in seeing you fail.<br/>Maybe I describe zero guards because I have an interest in seeing you win (which, by logic, is just as dishonest)<br/><br/>It matters not. You describe a thing, and I (and everyone else at the table) judge it at face value, and react to it for what it means to me.<br/>Is it ok?<br/>Is it not ok?<br/>How can we make it ok?<br/>And if anyone truly behaves badly, the mechanics polarise attention on such actions and alert Players that something out-game is wrong and the game should stop.<br/><br/>In my experience this is a crazy difficult thing to do spontaneously on your own. Even when you are aware of it, it's like a diet: you should do it, but in the end you don't.<br/>It's the stuff of "illuminated" Players and GMs (or just illuminated people, I would say).<br/>But in FateLess it's just a naturally occurring by-product of engaging with the game mechanics.<br/>Or at least, that's the design goal.<br/><br/>So in a nutshell...\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Perhaps the best answer to, "Why do you want 30 guards instead of zero?" is, "Because I feel like it!

And only then you consider the difficulty of the <b>Task</b>.<br/><br/>So you want in the building, and 30 guards are spread here and there patrolling it.<br/>What is your course of action?<br/><br/>Load your guns and barge into the front entrance, screaming and kicking and shooting?<br/>Ok.<br/>Then maybe you don't trigger a test at all, it's painfully obvious to everyone that you will be mowed down by an overwhelming number of guards. You don't roll against crazy odds; you just don't roll because it is not possible. This might be a perfect time to Dissent, by the way.<br/><br/>Or maybe we are all cool with the idea that this described action might at least be possible, if not probable, and you could survive and succeed... because movies! (or maybe you won the Dissent)<br/>Then going by your description the Difficulty of the test is established:<br/>2 is the base, which already assumes that the action is difficult<br/>+2 if your action in inherently super duper difficult<br/>+2 if aggravating circumstances hinder your action<br/>+2 for drama if the action would, in and of itself, lead you to achieve a Goal<br/><br/>In this example a solid 6 seems fair to me. Again this is not just arbitrary consensus, it is what looks obvious from the fiction. In case of problems, there's Dissent.<br/><br/>But what if you instead put on a disguise and try to pass as one of the guards?<br/>Then having 30 dudes roaming the area might actually help your plan, as it is easier to pass as just another face in this "crowd" of people.<br/>So you describe how you put on your costume and how you wait for a gap in the guard rotation, then you sneak in the first perimeter and... just walk among your peers.<br/>This calls for no roll, in and of itself.<br/>I can't imagine the other Players passing on the opportunity to have at least one guard call you out:<br/>"Hey you! ...do you have a cigarette?"<br/>Or something.<br/>Or maybe they are more aggressive (possibly as a result of Soft Opposition, possibly because someone tried to get a Fate by calling in a Damn!)<br/>"Hey you! ...why haven't I seen you at the briefing?"<br/><br/>THEN depending on your actions, you might trigger a test.<br/>But this way the number of guards has become completely irrelevant... you just need to get past this one suspicious guy.<br/>Although the Difficulty might still end up being 6 (or less, or more) because of how you describe your actions in this circumstance. The rule is always the same:<br/>2 is the base, which already assumes that the action is difficult<br/>+2 if your action in inherently super duper difficult<br/>+2 if aggravating circumstances hinder your action<br/>+2 for drama if the action would, in and of itself, lead you to achieve a Goal<br/><br/>Or maybe you try to ninja your way into the building, sneaking out of sight.<br/>(assuming you previously found a way to do it)<br/>Then maybe the action is difficult (so you roll) but not so terribly difficult (so you don't get the +2 Difficulty) but having 30 pairs of eyes moving around is an obvious hindrance (so you get that +2 Difficulty) for a grand total of Difficulty 4.<br/><br/>So yeah, numbers are crunched by the fiction. And an adverse fiction equals to a concrete increase in overall difficulty. But the actual Difficulty rating comes mainly from your fictional positioning, from your chosen action, and how you carry it out.<br/><br/>Maybe you instead find a way to have a legitimate excuse to enter the building, and now the guards are completely irrelevant, be they 3 or 30 or 300 <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/>I like to think of this as "tactical fiction".<br/>This is an element of Player skill very reminiscent of Old School gaming: you have a fictional goal (get in the building) and a fictional problem (a mob of enemies) and your main tool to solve it are your PC's fictional actions ... with a roll in between to shake things up a bit, according to how good or bad your idea was.<br/>Just an element, not a big deal, enough to add some concrete feeling of challenge to the game <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467093/#Comment_467093" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-18T08:43:10+00:00" title="October 18, 2017  8:43AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Player competition (for story control and such) requires a referee in case of disagreement.

And by using arbitration tools, as you call them, this works even if Players behave in a mildly antagonistic way ... as I mentioned before to David, Player motivation (do it for drama, do it for realism, do it for antagonism, etc) becomes a moot point.<br/><br/>It's maybe like... <b><i>using arbitration tools to achieve harmony</i></b>?<br/>This line of thought reminds me of an old (Forgite?) nugget of wisdom about rules and realism.<br/><br/>The idea would be that the human brain is usually exceptionally good at discerning what is realistic, what makes sense ... maybe everyone has a different opinion, but each will instantly have it: this makes sense, this is bullshit.<br/><br/>On the other hand the same brain is exceptionally bad at discerning probabilities and outcomes ... any infinite number of things might have a play in how things roll out, including self-interest, the desire to be surprised, etc.<br/><br/>So the point was: don't waste rules on something you already do spontaneously and exceptionally, and instead focus the rules on what you struggle with.<br/>I feel this is kind of a similar direction, maybe?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[gmLess] the Invisible-GM-Effect in FateLess - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21311/gmless-the-invisible-gm-effect-in-fateless/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[gmLess] the Invisible-GM-Effect in FateLess - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21311/gmless-the-invisible-gm-effect-in-fateless/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Cristal clear.
