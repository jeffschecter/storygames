I remember figuring out two successes for Burning Wheel but since Lady Blackbird (at least in the podcast) uses three, I went back to the drawing board.<br/><br/>3: 12.5% (this one's obvious: half * half * half = 12.5%)<br/>4: 31.25%<br/>5: 50.0%<br/>6: 65.625%<br/>7: 77.34375%<br/>8: 85.546875%<br/>9: 91.015625%<br/>10: 94.53125%<br/>11: 96.728515625%<br/><br/>My favorite chance of success as a game master or as a game designer is about 2/3. That means having six dice in Lady Blackbird. That didn't seem that common in the podcast, but I don't know.<br/><br/>I also came up with a pretty neat algorithm to finding it quickly:<br/><br/>(define (probs dice)<br/>  (* (/ (let loop ((dice dice) (obst 3))<br/>\t  (cond<br/>\t   ((zero? obst)  (expt 2 dice))<br/>\t   ((zero? dice) 0)<br/>\t   (else (+ (loop (sub1 dice) (sub1 obst))<br/>\t\t    (loop (sub1 dice) obst)))))<br/>\t(expt 2 dice))<br/>     100))<br/><br/>In other words, the program creates a binary tree of all die results, counts all branches that had at least three successes, and divides that number with the total number of branches, which is always 2 ^ the number of dice. E.g. with four dice there are going to be sixteen branches (2 ^ 4 = 16), five of those have three or more successes, and five divided by sixteen is 31.25.<br/><br/>The cool thing is that as soon as one branch has had three successes (rephrased as reduced three obstacles to zero), I know that all of its sub-branches are going to be successful as well so I can just sum it up without going through them.<br/>That said, there are still a lot of low-hanging fruit optimizations available, like I probably call (loop 4 3) a bunch of times. But sometimes memoization can be more expensive if the numbers are small enough.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Borogove" title="Borogove"><img alt="Borogove" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Borogove">Borogove</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446013/#Comment_446013" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T00:26:01+00:00" title="July  8, 2015 12:26AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2015 12:28AM by Borogove.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://anydice.com" rel="nofollow">Anydice</a> is good for this. <br/><br/>N successes on K dice would be "output Kd{0,1}" and set the view mode to "at least". <br/><br/>Here's an <a href="http://anydice.com/program/1601" rel="nofollow">example for 4 dice</a> (you have to change the view mode), showing 31.25% chance of at least 3 successes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446023/#Comment_446023" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T11:39:40+00:00" title="July  8, 2015 11:39AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, this is good.

I've played it several times now, and it's a blast. (Like I say in the thread, the only challenge is the handling time, but everyone I played with felt it was worth it - and most of the handling time is in Blackbird already, anyway: it's choosing Tags that tends to slow the game down most, in my experience.)<br/><br/>As for chances of failure, it's a bit different. You have much BETTER chances of success (in fact, you can almost never fail, if you make it your priority) than in regular LB. The difference is that your successes are complicated and messy: you get Lost and Injured while situations grow more and more dangerous. Much like rolling 7-9 all the time in a game like Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>I wrote a whole hack of Blackbird using that system (including a different starting situation)... I should probably edit it and share it with everyone here sometime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446028/#Comment_446028" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T11:54:57+00:00" title="July  8, 2015 11:54AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's say things have one danger usually.<br/>To get two sixes, that's 7% on three dice.

I seem to remember people rolling 6-9 dice most of the time.<br/><br/>Maybe it would help to think of it this way:<br/><br/>1 Success - partial success (a 7-9 in AW terms)<br/>2 Successes - full success (10+)<br/>3-4 Successes - critical success<br/><br/>That's more or less what it feels like.<br/><br/>In the Naomi example, she flies off the back of the ship, which means we need a follow-up challenge to rescue her (does the crew turn back to rescue her, or keep flying?), or maybe she gets captured by the Imperials and now needs to try to escape herself, or some other such thing.<br/><br/>And keep in mind that you can often check off a Condition in order to upgrade your success dramatically.

But let's look at the last one, that one's interesting. I have one 6 and two 1's.<br/><br/>My choices:<br/><br/>1. I manage to get the Apothecary. Naomi gets shot in the process.<br/>2. I give up on the Apothecary during the battle, in order to protect Naomi. (Snargle's hoping for a kiss afterwards, perhaps? Not likely, something tells me...)<br/>3. I get what I want AND manage to keep someone from shooting Naomi by pushing her out of the room, but I get Trapped on the bridge as the airlock doors shut (a Condition).<br/><br/>That's pretty much how it goes.<br/><br/>I don't know about you, but I want way, way less of the first type of roll and more rolls like that last one. That's some exciting stuff; and I can pick and choose moments when I want use a lot of my Pool dice to (hopefully) succeed when I really need to.<br/><br/>The latter type of outcome feels much more like a fun Steampunk adventure than a straight success (to me, anyway). The heroes succeeded... but now here's a new problem! Naomi is bleeding out, we need to get to the planet's surface, where there is a healing pod, before she croaks! Snargle took control of the Apothecary... except now he's trapped on the bridge, and the ship's on fire.

That leaves almost no room for failure or the outcomes you're hoping to have. <br/><br/>In that kind of game, full success is more like a critical hit - a moment when you cheer because, wow, that was cool, well done, Snargle, you really pulled it off! (Think about your favourite movie and you'll notice there are very few such outcomes - they're rare and far between.)<br/><br/>It's also important, however, to pick the right Dangers. A major character getting shot (especially if it's in-genre for them to possible <i>die</i> from it) isn't a <i>typical</i> Danger, it's a really unusual, high-stakes one. It's the kind of thing that happens at the climax of an episode. So that means players will probably be using more Pool dice, as well - and the danger of something really bad happening is very, very appropriate.<br/><br/>(In fact, when I play this game, I often use two Dangers - and sometimes three - in high-stakes situations, I get rid of the Basic die - you only get Pool dice and Trait/Tag dice - and remove a few Tags from each Trait.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446052/#Comment_446052" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T18:57:48+00:00" title="July  8, 2015  6:57PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah yeah, the notion that you wouldn't typically put Naomi in such extreme danger if she was a PC was my first mistake.

Like, it's a heist that requires many steps and feints and stealthy actions and knocking people out with blackjacks, and you're SO GOOD at everything, but there's SO MUCH to do in order to achieve all your goals/grab all the loot/etc. So you decide if you're going to "push your luck" in order to get more of what you want, versus taking the shortest/safest approach.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446078/#Comment_446078" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-09T04:56:53+00:00" title="July  9, 2015  4:56AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say both Riddle of Steel and 3:16 have reliably produced fairly high overall success, real sense of danger games for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446081/#Comment_446081" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-09T06:13:22+00:00" title="July  9, 2015  6:13AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm cool with higher <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446098/#Comment_446098" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-09T20:59:38+00:00" title="July  9, 2015  8:59PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, want to explain how/why?
