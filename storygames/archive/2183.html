                    Inspired by Tony Lower-Basch's incisive questions in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/2176/should-the-true-final-conflict-be-treated-differently" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, this is what I did today instead of working.<br/><br/>It illustrates the thinking behind my comments in that thread.  Notice how the decision of other players to oppose your bid to win or not can be influenced by their sense of whether or not you deserve to win based on the kind of thematic statement you're making.  At least, that's what I'd argue.<br/><br/>MOON QUEST<br/><br/>Each character is a Knight of the Moon, dispatched by the Grand Templar on a quest to find the Moon Castle and bring the Night Sky Cauldron back to the Land that lost it, and aches for that loss.<br/><br/>Give your character a knightly name, and distribute 10 points among the following attributes:<br/><br/>Bravery.  Physical courage and prowess.<br/>Cleverness.  Quickness of wit and tongue.<br/>Wisdom.  Powers of perception and understanding.<br/>Virtue.  Purity of heart and moral strength.<br/><br/>The game is structured around your journey from the Fortress-Temple of your order to the Moon Castle, where if your character is worthy, he can retrieve the Night Sky Cauldron and heal the Land.<br/><br/>To begin, describe setting out and journeying across the Land, either with your fellow knights or alone. Each player should provide a short initial description of this kind, at which point the first turn is complete.<br/><br/>On subsequent turns, draw a card at the beginning of your turn.  This card will determine the nature of the challenge you face this turn, bravery (Spades), cleverness (Hearts), wisdom (Clubs), or virtue (Diamonds).  Donâ€™t show anyone the card.<br/><br/>Continue the story from the perspective of your character.  Before you end your turn, youâ€™ll propose a test for your character by suggesting that some element of your narrative is a challenge to your bravery, cleverness, wisdom, or virtue in line with the card you drew at the beginning of the turn.  The player to your left and right then each roll one die (if thereâ€™s only one other player, he or she rolls two dice).<br/><br/>If both roll less than or equal to your attribute, you get to describe how you overcome the challenge by virtue of that attribute (bravery, cleverness, wisdom, or virtue).  If one fails, the player to your right describes how you overcome the challenge by virtue of the attributeâ€™s contrast (prudence, honesty, innocence, or humanity).  If both fail, the player to your left describes how you fail the test by displaying the attributeâ€™s opposite (cowardice, gullibility, ignorance, or sinfulness).<br/><br/>Give the card you drew to the player who finished the story; if thatâ€™s you, you keep the card.  If you overcame the challenge, put a tick mark next to the relevant attribute (i.e., bravery, cleverness, wisdom, or virtue).<br/><br/>At the beginning of your turn, you can opt not to draw a card and instead say, â€œAnd then I came upon the Moon Castle,â€ or something of similar import. Describe how you come to face to face with one of the Moon Castleâ€™s four legendary guardians:  the gallant Knight of Stars (who tests bravery), the enigmatic Moon Wolf (who tests cleverness), the madly grandiose Lord of Shadows (who tests wisdom), or the decadent Silver Queen (who tests virtue).  Describe the nature of their opposition to you, and your initial efforts to overcome them.<br/><br/>At this point, everyone plays as many cards as they want, either for you or against you.  You win if the cards for you have a higher total sum than the cards against you, with face cards counting as 10 and aces counting as 11.  Otherwise, you fail.  <br/><br/>The person with the most tick marks in the relevant attribute gets to describe how this happens. Cut cards to resolve ties.<br/><br/>If you succeed, you win.  If you fail, the game continues.  You may take additional turns if your character survives his failure, but he may never visit the Moon Castle again.  Hold on to your cards and your tick marks.                </div>

                            Are players really likely to spend their cards to prevent you when those are the same cards that will let <i>them</i> succeed?<br/>
<br/>
Or, more to the point, wouldn't I always be better off bullying <i>someone else</i> into opposing you than I would opposing you myself?                        </div>

                            Hrm.  Yes, ideally you'd want to hold someone's coat so he would oppose the prospective winner and you could save your cards for your own victory.  But let's imagine that the rules impose some structure.  Say that the Moon Castle turn looks like this:  The player says, "I'm facing the Moon Wolf, who shows me two doors, tells me that the Cauldron is behind one of them and a man-eating dragon is behind the other, and says to choose," and he lays down all his Hearts (assuming he wants to win). The next player, without prompting or coaching from the others, has to decide whether to throw cards into the "for" or "against" pile. And so forth.<br><br>That might go a little way to discourage the "Let's you and him fight" move. It also might establish the kind of dynamic where you'd wonder if others would support or oppose you based on their attitude toward your character or their desire to win.<br/><br/>As I think about it, I suppose it's a good idea to give each player a hand of cards at the beginning of the game, so that the motivation to go for an early victory with a single card would be reduced.  Three cards would probably be enough.                        </br></br></div>
