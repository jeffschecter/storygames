I have a question about situation and colour. Story Games is probably not the perfect place to ask it, but I do think I'll get an answer that helps me, so here is the question.<br/><br/>In Cthulhu games, colour is really important. For example, you're walking through the maze of Victorian London, the mud stinks and the fog curls around your feet. All that description is important.<br/><br/>Now, sometimes, these details can become something that you need to respond to. You're walking through Victorian London, but you can't find your way out of the maze of streets, which shift before your eyes. The mud stinks of something ancient and unnatural. The fog seems to be grabbing at your boots, trying to trip you up. (There's an implicit challenge here: how do you respond to this? Do you keep going? Examine things in more detail? Make sure your loved ones are safe?)<br/><br/>Is the first colour? And is the second situation? And, if so, where is the line between the two?<br/><br/>Because I'm always adding creepy colour to scenes. There's a thin line between "Here is weird colour" and "Here is something you must deal with". Often, the players choose whether to accept something as description or deal with it actively.<br/><br/>Could someone explain where one becomes the other?<br/><br/>(Please stop this thread if it goes for over 50 posts).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322732/#Comment_322732" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T03:01:21+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  3:01AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>There's a thin line between "Here is weird colour" and "Here is something you must deal with".

My first thought with those particular examples is that they sound like colo(u)r, which <i>could become</i> a situation <i>if that's where everyone decides to take it</i>.<br/><br/>If the players react to the maze of streets or the too-clingy fog by poking at it, testing to see if it's an obstacle, and you decide, "Hey, that's fun!" and run with it -- you've all just made it a situation.  If instead you shrug and say, "No, perhaps your mind was just playing tricks on you, out here all alone on this dismal night," then you're basically selling it as color.  But maybe you'll change your mind when the players keep poking at it (because any force which can bend the very streets to its will simply cannot be ignored).<br/><br/>Likewise, you might throw a weak situation out there ("the mud smells weird"), but the players won't see it as something they can poke at or something that presents any interesting features ("yeah, yeah, weird mud; we already knew we were fighting an ancient and unnatural force, but thank you for telling us again") and will move on to find a more interesting situation to engage with...basically making the mud situation just a bit of color.<br/><br/>I think most of the games I've been in have hopped back and forth across that thin line a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322734/#Comment_322734" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T03:19:10+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  3:19AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's situation if a player acts on it and colour otherwise. That's a pretty subjective view but it conforms with the old adage about scenarios not surviving an encounter with players. Robin Laws' Skulduggery scenario set in the Dying Earth was about 5 people trapped in a hotel and condemned to servitude, we also had to come up with a ranking between us. Which part of this ended up as colour and which was situation depended entirely on what the players did (for us condemned to servitude was colour and the ranking situation).<br/><br/>In mystery games, such as most Mythos games, the difference between colour and situation is important for players who like to be able to tell the difference as colour can turn into a lead (something which happens a lot in Cthulhu Dark).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322737/#Comment_322737" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T03:46:05+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  3:46AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2011 3:49AM by Graham.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd really appreciate some advice from someone that is familiar with the Forge terminology.

Let me try and summarise it with an example.<br/><br/><i>A. As you walk through London, the streets seem maze-like. They twist and turn like the intestines of an animal. Sometimes, as you walk, you imagine that they shift behind you.</i><br/><br/>This is colour. <br/><br/><i>B. As you walk through London, the streets seem maze-like. Even though you have lived here for years, you cannot find your way out. When you look round, the streets have clearly shifted behind you.</i><br/><br/>This is situation. It is clearly related, fictionally, to the colour given above. However, this time, it demands a reaction. That reaction may simply be to ignore the shifting streets, but that's a reaction too.<br/><br/>Now, in Cthulhu Dark, a die roll can decide whether you get a description like A or B. That is fine. The die roll is, broadly speaking, deciding whether you get colour or situation. <br/><br/>Finally and interestingly, player reaction can change whether something is situation or colour. For example, imagine the following conversation:<br/><br/><i>GM: As you walk through London, the streets seem maze-like. Sometimes, as you walk, you imagine that they shift behind you.<br/>Player: I think they're shifting behind me?<br/>GM: You think so.<br/>Player: Right. So I get out my map and check...</i><br/><br/>The shifting streets are now situation. It's an oversimplication to say "The players decide whether it's colour or situation", but certainly, situation is created interactively, rather than just by the GM.<br/><br/>I'm happy with that. People who know Forge stuff: if I have got any of this wrong, please do correct me, here or elsewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322765/#Comment_322765" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T07:33:33+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  7:33AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>1.

That is fine. The die roll is, broadly speaking, deciding whether you get colour or situation.</blockquote> Can you say more about that, Graham? I'm not familiar with Cthulhu Dark. <br/>Color is basically a flat, inactive version of System, Character, Setting, or Situation. It's basically the bits that aren't informing the mechanics in such a way as to directly affect how we use them. <br/>Point being that Color is *any* element that's "just for descriptive purposes", even if it's part of the Situation. If you had put in another detail like "You hear a hound baying in the distance", until/unless someone actually acts like that matters mechanically (I search for the hound's trail! I roll Knowledge to determine what kind of hound!), it's just Color.<br/>Color is basically words spoken at the table without describing action or mechanical constraint/effect. Once anyone imbues it with more significance, or "picks it up" as it were, it turns into Setting, Situation, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322779/#Comment_322779" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T08:28:35+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  8:28AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't think of any Forge conversations about this, Graham.<br/><br/>So... the creepy color is always a potential threat but then only becomes an actual threat if one or more players (including the GM) press against it or press forward with it?  That sounds right to me.  It's a bit different than "Threaten Badness" in AW, right? Because introducing the creepy color is not necessarily a harbinger of any particular future threat.  It might just turn out to be color!  But then, through exploration of this scene (and future scenes), it either rears its head or builds to a threat or it doesn't.<br/><br/>On the GM's side, what happens if players take something as a threat that was originally intended to be just color?  Is it partially my role as the GM to connect it back to whatever horrors are lurking in the darkness and turn it into an actual threat?

Going strictly by Forge definitions, Color is completely neutral and inert with regards to the characters in the game, right?<br/><br/>Specifically, though, Graham's question is "when does one become the other?" To me, the answer is, when you as the player decide to make it one or the other, by interacting with Color, or by ignoring a element of Situation entirely. Notice that Color is "details", and Situation is "interaction". One just sits there looking pretty, one is an active thing that you do. But neither are set in stone - you can explore the details of a single scene all day, turning the simplest offers that arise from the Color into fantastic interactions, or you can (as a group) decide to ignore "active" elements of a scene, rendering them into mere Color. It's all just a matter of what you choose to have your characters focus on, or, depending on the game, what the mechanics demand. (I say "as a group", because if, say, the players have determined to completely ignore an element that the GM intends to use as a threat or an obstacle, there's probably going to be some disconnect there...)<br/><br/>(Note that elements of Situation aren't always threats or challenges. Finding a pistol with one shot left in the drainage ditch or noticing that ranger eyeing you in the corner of the tavern is Situation, as well.)<br/><br/>(Note also that I'm probably just saying what everyone else is saying above, just less clearly.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322808/#Comment_322808" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T10:06:44+00:00" title="May  3, 2011 10:06AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Graham - why do you want to know? How will it inform your design or play decisions?<br/><br/>I don't get this from the forge, but I think of color - in board and video games - as what experienced players learn to filter out. An experienced Call of Duty player stops seeing your delicious textures, normal maps, and HDR lighting - he only sees targets and cover. A 3rd or 4th ed D&amp;D player running through a module with those call-out description boxes stops listening when the GM reads those descriptions - all they need to know is where are the badguys and maybe how high the ceiling is if they can fly. In *A Theory of Fun* Raph Koster calls what I think of as color 'dressing.'<br/><br/>I do know this definition of 'color' is a term not limited to RPG's - Richard Garfield uses the term too, more or less in the way I mean it.<br/><br/>The takeaway here, for me, is that 'just color' in an RPG is a bad thing. You probably want your players paying attention to everything. Maybe that spooky fog is irrelevant detail, but maybe not. Maybe that statue is just decoration, or maybe it's a clue.<br/><br/>So could that be a small flaw in Cthulhu Dark?  If I roll a 4 on my investigate and the GM describes something and I'm thinking "I can ignore him now, because I only rolled a 4 so I know he's not telling me anything useful" ... ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322810/#Comment_322810" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T10:09:22+00:00" title="May  3, 2011 10:09AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.<br/><br/>I am having a helpful conversation with Vincent, in which he suggests that colour and situation are not two separate things.

It's very much in-your-face with its situation-ness: the statuette is being malevolently evil in a way that you cannot fail to recognize.  There's no ambiguity, no "I don't know if this is something that needs to be dealt with or not."  It is a powerful statement delivered with a lot of force, which is why it CAN demand that you make a choice about it.<br/><br/>And I'm sure that difference in forcefulness has a lot to do with the difference between situation and color, but I didn't get the impression that it was that particular difference you were grasping for when dealing with things closer to the line.  Maybe I'm wrong about that, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322818/#Comment_322818" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T10:26:21+00:00" title="May  3, 2011 10:26AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>The first statement is offering a choice as well.

It seems particularly appropriate to DRYH because everyone already has a strong, personalized situation, right off the bat.
