In his brief opinion this includes the rules being guidelines leaving space for individual intrepretation by the GM at the table and the focus on the challenging the player.<br/><br/>I play in two very different groups. In one we play all the latest indie games and in the other we play a twenty plus year old AD&amp;D campaign. Although there are bound to be similarities just from the fact that all of us from both groups are pretty much of an age, another thing I've noticed is that the indie games often generate a similar integration of characters and complexity of relationships to those that are present in the AD&amp;D game. <br/><br/>Although character advancement is not always present in Indie games, there are usually ways of making your character more capable of impact in the game world or a clear indication of some goal in the game and this provides a very similar focus or drive to the game as does levelling up in AD&amp;D.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the main benefit of playing an indie game is that the focus is often much clearer than Old School games and the richness of the game is achieved more quickly. Indie gamers also seem more aware of what they want from a game and how this interacts with the needs of the other players (some of them anyway).<br/><br/>Is this a similar experience to those of others here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195599/#Comment_195599" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T07:42:09+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  7:42AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm. Not really!<br/><br/>I played AD&amp;D 1st and 2nd Edition from about 1983 to 1996 pretty constantly, and then a scattering of play until 3E came out. I had campaigns that lasted a couple years at tops, and I restarted frequently. My original high school 1E campaign lasted about 4 years and the characters leveled from 1st to about 12th level. Did we have fun? I like to think so. It was often frustrating for me and my players though, as we were looking for different things. But I'm drifting off topic.<br/><br/>The indie games that integrate characters do so rather intentionally and reliably. If there was character integration in AD&amp;D, it was an accident or via my painful effort as a DM to get people integrated. The relationships were never complex. Probably, a lot of that can be blamed on the immaturity of a group of young adults, not the game system, but nothing in the AD&amp;D rules helped us create complex character relationships, or rewarded us for it.<br/><br/>Indie games have tended to have tighter rules with less room for GM interpretation "in the moment." Really, specifically, the GM as sole arbiter of what happens when you say your character does something is eschewed by many indie designers. The Old School Renaissance that is happening seems to be a throwback by people who are saying, "Yes, but what if I do trust my GM? Why should I be hamstrung by the rules? The game can be so awesome...!" There's a lot of value to that.<br/><br/>I think the issue of leveling up as an indicator of a character's impact on the game world is a red herring, since it's present in all versions of D&amp;D, not just the old school games. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>It seems to me that the main benefit of playing an indie game is that the focus is often much clearer than Old School games and the richness of the game is achieved more quickly.

Any functional game with even a sliver of story focus should have "integration of characters and complexity of relationships".<br/><br/>If anything, I think the reason you're seeing this effect in Old School gaming at all is because the campaigns tend to last a very, very, <i>very</i> long time, and character development is bound to happen over the course of several years of gaming regardless of the lack of actual rules governing that development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195822/#Comment_195822" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T07:39:11+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  7:39AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>I'm not sure what your red herring argument means.

It exists in every version of D&amp;D. I agree that most games offer a way to increase the character's impact on the game world, but I don't understand how it's relevant to your argument that "old school = new school."<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Do you find that this applies to the Old School games of yours that have worked?</blockquote>\nAgain, not really. When my old school games really worked well, they produced a kind of game that I haven't been able to reproduce with successful indie games. These were sweeping, epic stories with that "zero to hero" feel. I think a lot of indie games intentionally design to avoid characters starting weak and "campaigns" that sprawl over years of play. <br/><br/>Also, I have generally not enjoyed the specific indie games that attempted to step into that space, such as Burning Wheel and The Shadow of Yesterday. I'm working on my own answer to D&amp;D, in fact, because no indie game fills that need for me, and D&amp;D doesn't do what I want reliably.<br/><br/><b>What is it about old school fantasy RPGs that I liked?</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Zero to hero play</span>. I thought I didn't like it, but it turns out I do. I like how characters grow in different ways: their personal power, their community status, and their understanding of the universe. What I don't like about it: high character mortality at the beginning.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Long, sweeping, epic stories</span>. Practical concerns often keep me from running games that span years, so I end up running indie games as one-shots or three-shots. I miss the investment in a character arc. What I don't like about it: lack of direction and poor pacing.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GM setting prep.</span> It's fun to create a world and "present" it. I think a lot of players enjoy the exploration of a strange new world, especially in fantasy. What I don't like about it: Railroading players, or creating stuff no one cares about.<br/><br/>I think indie games can offer these things and address some of the problems. You can have zero-to-hero play without killing off the zeros, and still give players a sense of accomplishment. Death can be made meaningful, too. You can have games that last years but are built of several-session mini-arcs. Stories can build toward something big and actually reach those goals and end instead of petering out. You can have a setting that the GM creates but ensure a certain amount of player buy-in, and avoid forcing the GM's "story" onto players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195823/#Comment_195823" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T07:39:14+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  7:39AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve,<br/><br/>I am an avid reader of many old school renaissance blogs and one of the things I see them doing quite a bit is figuring out what old school means and the roots of the hobby that they find themselves in.

You know what you want, and you can use any number of tool sets to get that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
