While every game didn't go off, vast majority did.<br/><br/>Parking problems, the hotel's ridiculousness regarding the bed/frame placement and some other issues aside, the con went well very for most everyone.  And overall con attendance was UP by nearly a third from last year's OrcCon!<br/><br/>On a personal note, I finally got to play Pendragon (played it once before with Greg Stafford as GM) -- CK was the GM here and the whole session was outstanding.  Also, a great Victorian-horror game played on Monday morning that ended up feeling like Henry James/Mervyn Peake by way of Conan.

My highlights include: meetig the World Famous and Award Winning Paul Tevis (who is, by the way, a master salesman and the primary reason for my now meager wallet), playing John Wick's House of the Blooded game, playing in Colin's Spirit of the Century game, smoozing with all the Nerd SoCal folks (these folks know how to game and party until you drop like no others I have met; truly legendary sleep-ignoring abilities, especially the aforementioned Colin, who may not have slept the entire con), and talking to the legendary Steve Jackson.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Paul, Denys, and company for a great weekend!  It was the most fun I've had at con ever.

It was interesting to see different takes on the characters.<br/><br/>I think that playing in The Upgrade! both times was my third favorite thing about the con.  It was the right crowd of folks, all of whom were interested in "this Scandinavian thing," so I think the games fired off wicked well.  In both games, we only had three of the couples playing.  In the first, we also had a co-host, which worked awesome.  I'd be happy to unpack more of my thoughts on the games, though at the moment I'm still pretty exhausted from the con.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127686/#Comment_127686" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T12:21:25+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 12:21PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I want to hear everything.

Paul and Denys, you guys did an awesome job organizing everything.<br/><br/>My Roanoke game ended up with 7 players, including two teenage girls. I was a little wary about that, but we kept it PG-13 and folks mentored both of them at the table very well. As someone with an infant daughter who I hope will be interested in role playing one day, it was nice to be pushed outside my comfort zone and find there was nothing but good on the other side.<br/><br/>You guys definitely got your hooks in me now.
