I'm also finishing a long campaign that's led up to epic thousand man battles. There are currently two things going through my mind:<br/><br/>1. Mass Combat systems in RPGs are atrocious at worst, groan worthy at best. Yet, 'epic heroes' will inevitably find themselves there time and again. As fun as it is in the movies, it's absolute shite in an RPG. Even DitV's awesome rules for Groups break down when you have a group of 50. (break down as in tedium, not 'realism')<br/>2. The Art of War is simple, classic, deep, and heavy with the ring of truth.<br/><br/>My idea (inspired by Daniel's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10356&amp;page=1#pgtop" rel="nofollow">Fighting Fighters</a>) is to design a <a href="http://dogdaygames.blogspot.com/2009/09/rules-of-war.html" rel="nofollow">plug-n-play set of Mass Combat rules</a> [Edited to link to the finished rules] that can drop into almost any game, using the classic Art of War as a starting point.\n<blockquote><cite><a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Tzu/artwar.html" rel="nofollow">The Art of War</a> 1:4</cite>The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine [advantage] . . . These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.</blockquote>\nTo me, this just <i>screams</i> for the initial skill rolls to martial your troops and the recon missions necessary to gauge the enemy's strength. The better your scouts or generals roll on their 'Knowledge Nature' checks to evaluate the terrain, the larger the bonus provided to your army for the upcoming battle. Etc, etc, etc.<br/><br/>So what do you all think? Is this a curious idea that you'd love to hear more on or is this a complete waste of time and something you'd never use?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231483/#Comment_231483" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T23:25:34+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 11:25PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had considered doing something like this for a game I'm working on but it didn't exactly fit the feel I was going for, so I never developed it.

Now I want to mashup the one-roll engine mechanic with my market mechanic to attach different dimensions to those five factors. Here's how the market mechanic works. It's a one-roll way to randomly generate the availability of a resource and how much that resource costs.\n<blockquote>- Roll a pool of d6s.<br/>- For each die resulting in 1-3, one banana is available for purchase.<br/>- Each die resulting in 4-6 is how much one banana costs.<br/><br/>In other words, when there is a lot of resource available, it costs less. When there isn't much available, it costs more.<br/><br/>For example, you rolled 5 dice and you got 1, 4, 3, 6, 2. That means there are three bananas available and each one will cost you 2 bucks. </blockquote>\nNow, this is designed to model a marketplace of limited resources, but it might be re-skinned for your recon scenario.<br/><br/>- For example, you send out a team of scouts.<br/>- For each scout, you roll one die.<br/>- You roll once for each factor The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method.<br/>- The "resources" in this case are the potential advantage you might have in each of these five factors. (+1, +2, +3, etc.)<br/>- The "cost" is how many troops you must commit in order to achieve each rank in that advantage. (Getting a +1 in Heaven will cost me 40 men.)<br/><br/>You could make a story around this by saying, "The storms are approaching to the east. If we commit 40 men on strong horses to lure the enemy into the mud, we will have a strong advantage in the coming battle."<br/><br/>Very cool idea, Jarvis!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231574/#Comment_231574" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T07:31:06+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  7:31AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2009 7:36AM by Bill_White.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have had a similar game idea on a back burner for some time: it defines characters and the world in terms of concepts laid out in <i>The Art of War</i>, it uses the <i>I Ching</i> as an oracular resolution mechanic, and it's set on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He" rel="nofollow">Chinese treasure fleet</a> expeditions, or a fantastic version thereof. In my head, it's called <b>The Seven Voyages of Admiral Zheng He</b>. I should add that Clinton Nixon has run something similar using <a href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/swansong.htm" rel="nofollow">Swansong</a>, which uses a tarot mechanic in places.<br/><br/>In terms of a modular combat system, I think that anything that would be sufficiently portable to be modular would lose the flavor of Sun Tzu's text. Of course, that may be the point: in a world where Sun Tzu is regarded as a management guru in some quarters, the modularity is assumed: it's just how the world works.

As is, it pleases the hell out of myself (story focused) and my pickiest player (strategy focused). I think I must be doing something right!<br/><br/>The only thing I'm still worried about is that I defaulted to a dice pool mechanic. I'll have to do some more thinking if I actually want it to convert to fudge or D20 too. For now, it's not a big deal to whip out a few D6s to settle a battle before going back to your normal system though.<br/><br/>Daniel, I'd love to see how your market mechanic would fit into something like this. I tried hard to really streamline everything and not have the 'battle rolls' slow down the normal player character game play, but I'm definitely not opposed to a little more crunch if it pays off afterward!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232192/#Comment_232192" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T06:22:53+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  6:22AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks really interesting Jarvis.
