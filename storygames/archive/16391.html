Basically an expanded system similar to Ars Magica in that in the beginning they get their toes wet by learning vocabulary - nouns and verbs and then as they progress and want to become more powerful they learn some grammar and how to make and speak in complete sentences. Unlike Ars Magica, however, there aren't just a few techniques and forms to learn. Each time you cast a spell you'll need to drop the proper noun and verb to match the context so you'll actually be building up a language base to work with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm working on setting up a website and forum for supporting it, getting some videos up to teach the sections, pronunciation guides, etc. So while you will probably have some sweet D&amp;D; vocabulary building going on, a lot of it will be functional and applicable to actually learning and speaking the language. I went to French immersion school and I'm doing a double major here in Korea on Korean education and French so French will be the next language up to bat if there is enough interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374450/#Comment_374450" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T04:18:29+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  4:18AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also a language teacher (German) and would be interested in seeing how this works out in terms of pedagogy.<br><br>At present, I use several rudimentary RPGs to teach German:<br/><br/>1. <i>Dread</i>, based on the German <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFuNOqhFoqQ" rel="nofollow">Geisterbahn</a> tradition. This involves simple questionnaires, an obviously railroaded tunnel of horrors, etc.  The most important aspect is that language-learners have to depart from their comfort zones in order to take an action that has them climb out of the cart, cleverly holding back the monsters, and so forth.<br/><br/>2. Parlor larps for students to pretend that they're famous figures from a particular city's history (Berlin, Vienna, Leipzig) and they have simple political goals which they may or may not fulfill. The open-endedness of the scenario allows them to explore the personality of this figure through language... and many of them form such strong attachments to their characters within 50 minutes that they write their final projects on these characters.<br/><br/>Anyway, ping for interest.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374462/#Comment_374462" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T05:53:26+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  5:53AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I certainly like the idea of using a foreign language for in-game power/reward.

This game is about drama, relationships, pain, catharsis and the pursuit of happiness. The setting is present day and the players play high school students that have decided to be enrolled at Brakebills College for Magical Pedagogy. For those that have not read the book, it's been described as Harry Potter for adults. A wizard is able to cast spells because he's a unhappy and a little bit broken. Basically when players frame scenes in which they are effected in a negative way emotionally they gain drama points and those points can then be spent (and are needed) to cast spells. Another thing I like about the books and setting - and mostly playing in it - is that it doesn't side step other fantasy novels and makes it really fun to be a bit "meta". Characters know of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings so you can kind of play yourself (or a teenage version of you) very easily and really get into it. For those that have read the books, The Neitherlands provides a vehicle for playing modern characters in fantasy settings. What if scenarios like what would I do if I was magician that was dropped into Narnia, Lord of the Rings, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where learning a language comes in. In order to cast spells they have to speak Korean (the book guides players through pronunciation, alphabet, etc and I'm working on getting a website going for video tutorials). There are two systems in the book, the first is the "Apprentice System" which is basically a more hardcore version of Ars Magica in which players slap together a verb and noun to cast a spell but there are no all-encompassing nouns and verbs i.e. players have to use a different noun and verb depending on the spell and context of what they want to do. The second system "The Master System" builds on that vocabulary by teaching grammar patterns so that players learn to cast spells by speaking in complete, full sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously for something like this to work you'd have to get a group together that all had the language learning goal in mind, I also plan on putting out a kind of "adventure path" that would take the players and coach the GM through a bunch of adventures designed to bring the players from virtually no-knowledge to an elementary level. Essentially instead of traditional exercises and grammar drills and such, all the learning would be framed as an rpg and I'll have a forum up and running with video tutorials and help of course as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm in the middle of a double major in Korea right now (Korean education, French) so I plan on doing a book for Korean first and then French soon afterward. I was hoping other people would think this was cool, would maybe want to playtest and/or give feedback and help me start building a community around rpgs for language learning! I've only playtested it here in Korea but it's been going well, despite seeing lots of changes as we go along but obviously the foreigners here in Korea have a vested interest in learning Korean so there is that motivation. I've also been playtesting it since it was an idea for a rpg game designed to teach English at the school I was teaching at so there's where it got started.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Evan">@Evan</a> - Very cool! I do worry that it'll be a bit hardcore but I'm hoping people will be motivated and people in their group will encourage each other. If you have a GM fluent in the target language you're gold really, as they'll be able to coach you. Like I said, I plan on doing an Adventure Path type scenario to run the GM and players through and have online support for pronunciation, etc. In my brain it's all very awesome, I'm working on making it a reality<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/zircher">@zircher</a> - Japanese is on my list, it's actually very similar to Korean in terms of grammar, syntax and even some common vocabulary. I figured Japanese would be more popular but I'm doing a major in Korean education and French so I figured I'd start there. If people are into it though, I definitely will look into Japanese and probably German. And in the future, who knows!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374494/#Comment_374494" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T08:50:46+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  8:50AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Especially Re: casting spells, ASL would be awesome for somatic components.

Like at first they might say "Make fire man", then later "burn him" then later "I call fire to roast you like a pig".<br><br>I think once you got past 1st year language instruction, you'd want to focus on full language speech in character. At that point, doing more larp-like scenarios, particularly heavily structured ones, seems like it would be more useful.

Good thing we know how to make indie games about awful circumstances, I guess. To be less critical, it might make more sense to make a game set in the West that teaches a language native to that region, like Navajo or Sioux, which are still fairly widely spoken. But that would require a designer who knows and desires to teach those languages through gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dbrown" title="dbrown"><img alt="dbrown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/133/nMWVBVRKLGUBK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dbrown">dbrown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374631/#Comment_374631" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T18:49:16+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  6:49PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're in the Seoul area and need playtesters, sign me up!

It's going well so far, but mostly because I'm able to coach them through it and anything they need or want to be able to do I can teach them - it'll be less easy for GMs that are learning the language at the same time.

It's sort of like a great-great-grandchild of Apocalypse World, and it works for any students who already have basic skills in speaking English. The rules are presented in moves like, "When you face danger, test your Bravery" and then for each success point they get in a little hand game I made up, they can choose words like "forcefully, quickly, cautiously, or precisely." Of course they have to learn the word they're choosing so they know what they want, and then they use that word to narrate whatever the outcome of their character's action is (kind of like John Harper's "Wildlings" if you've heard of that). If they have any trouble saying things in English, I help them along of course, but basically they're just playing the game and having a good time. They have to make sentences with the new words they learned as homework, and of course they get to earn experience points by playing (and even more by GMing), with which they get to buy more new moves, which leads to more vocabulary and grammar development as the moves become more interesting, diverse, and complex.<br><br>But my problem has always been that kids already need some basic knowledge in English before they can play my game. Your game principles you're working on seem like just the thing for those students who have no experience in English at all. I'd love to see your game notes if you have them in a form you could share. Even if not, I'll definitely have my own take on it when I have time.

At the time I was pretty free-form with it though, just coaching them on case-by-case depending on what they wanted to do. The version I'm doing now is for English natives learning Korean though so it will definitely be starting from nothing and a specific lesson plan tied to adventures and such. I think what I'm going to do is have the core book just be how to progress, what you'll learn, the grammar and rules for reference and then I'll do a separate work book that will be exercises but presented and framed like an adventure in which players practice the stuff they've learned and then a section for the GM will ideas and a sample adventure path to introduce and have conflicts that play towards what the players have learned in the book so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted a link to the notes I wrote up for the teaching Korean version, the English version notes are just scribbles in a notebook basically, it worked really well though and was the impetus for the other language versions. One kid in particular got really into it - he told me he hated school because he was always picked on for being half Chinese. In the game though, any conflict scenes that stress out or emotionally damage characters make them stronger (in terms of magic). In one scene I had a bully knock down his books while he was walking down the hall on his way to class. He looked at me for a couple seconds and then smiled, "now I'm strong enough to fight the monster in the maze."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dbrown" title="dbrown"><img alt="dbrown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/133/nMWVBVRKLGUBK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dbrown">dbrown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374818/#Comment_374818" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T23:08:25+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 11:08PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">@Kayfall</a> I overcame the problem of my students needing basic English to start by designing a sort of World of Warcraft newbie zone / D&amp;D Starter Kit that's been tuned to a grammar/notational syllabus.

So things have changed a fair amount since I was last working on the RPG. Unfortunately I won't be able to get the IP rights for The Magicians by Lev Grossman because there's a TB show in the works! Which I'm totally fine with because that should be pretty cool. Every time I've played we've found ourselves changing the setting around to fit the group, asking questions and letting the setting develop organically and it's been a lot of fun. I was wondering if anyone could help me out and take a look at the core mechanics and tell me what they think?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vqjqby9s45ydrae/Magicians%20RPG.pdf" rel="nofollow">Magicians RPG - updated</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBasically the system works like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for anyone who has read the book \u201cThe Magicians\u201d by Lev Grossman they may have noticed some key differences to the way magic works in his books. For one, all magicians are broken in some way; they\u2019ve got a wound, a deep emotional scar that provides the fuel for their magic. I still will be basing the mechanics around this idea because it was this idea among many that I found so novel and interesting. I really wanted to make a came about it because the very idea of it was tragic. In the game, players build up a pool of points that are used to cast spells. In order to build up said points players have to play out scenes that show the emotional scarring all characters have. They can play out any kind of scene they want to show whether it be in the past or present. The more points you get the more potent your spells can become or the more of them you can cast. What this essentially means is that the players will be narrating their characters problems and emotional issues out while the Game Master will be providing conflict \u2013 usually in the form challenges or difficulties that require the casting of spells. And in between all this we have characters being teenagers in high school \u2013 making friends, having crushes, struggling in school but with magic added to the mix, adding that extra element that really sets things on fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically when players frame scenes in which they are effected in a negative way emotionally they gain drama points and those points can then be spent (and are needed) to cast spells. This is where learning a language comes in. In order to cast spells they have to speak Korean (the book guides players through pronunciation, alphabet, etc and I\u2019m working on getting a website going for video tutorials). There are two systems in the book, the first is the \u201cApprentice System\u201d in which players slap together a verb and noun to cast a spell, using a different noun and verb depending on the spell and context of what they want to do. The second system \u201cThe Master System\u201d builds on that vocabulary by teaching grammar patterns so that players learn to cast spells by speaking in complete, full sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts would be entirely welcome!

That document is written with teachers in mind who have little experience with gaming, so it may seem a little pedantic. (Also the name is rather generic, sorry.) It's designed to work for big classes where efficiency is important, so it uses a questing system where entire quest results are wrapped up into one big dice pool.
