She's been unlucky in love recently, until she meets Jason (played by Tobey McGuire). Jason's a really awesome guy with a sexy vespa, but he's got his quirks: he drinks green tea in the morning instead of coffee, and he's a dungeonmaster. Rachel is hesitant at first, but agrees to give roleplaying a try. She loves it! And it gives her a story seed for her novel. At first the group is cool with this idea, but Rachel goes on to make millions from her awesome fantasy saga, all inspired by the adventures that take place at the gaming table. Tensions emerge.

Just as the D&amp;D-esque game is getting ready, his little son and daughter come out in PJs and ask for a bedtime story.  Instead of stopping the game, one of the players suggests Wushu (to break the D&amp;D stereotype.)  So, they improv a monkey king or similar ancient China or Japanese tale.  <br/><br/>Once upon a time...  Like Peter Falk, the Dad would be the narrator voice in the story, the one connection between reality and the game story. <br/><br/>After quick character introductions, when the players are speaking in game we see the scene as if its being filmed in the Orient.  Down in the area where the subtitles would be, dice would appear as the characters perform their actions, each player have their own distinctive dice set.  The dice almost act like a power bar or similar action/tension building mechanic ala Scott Pilgrim.  As the movie progresses, the kids interrupt or veto actions ala the little boy in The Princess Bride.  Later in the shared fiction, the kids fall asleep and the Dad moves to stop, but one of the players says we can't leave the story untold.  So, they go back to finishing the story to get their happy ending before scooping up the kids.<br/><br/>While you could certainly play with the stereotypes, one that might be fun to do is the the big hairy guy that plays the competent swordswoman (I always like Michelle Yeoh for those roles).  I can see things like starting the characters in a tavern or sake house and having the kids complain but Dad saying, "It's tradition.  Do you want a story or not?"  :-)<br/><br/>It's kind of rambly, but I think it would work.  One of the fun things is that you make the real people very normal and the uber beautiful people are the Hollywood actors and actresses in the story.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331694/#Comment_331694" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T10:54:15+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 10:54AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Contingency Plan<br/><br/>There's a semi-popular TV show called "The Contingency Plan". It's about a bunch of ex-cons and their parole officer who decide to clean up their neighborhood using their various "skills" through some not so legal means. <br/><br/>An RPG of the show has been licensed and produced. The writer's room of the TV show just got the books sent to them. Most of writers (the main characters of the movie) used to play rpgs or something else similarly geeky (Magic, Larps, whatever). For the hell of it, they decide to play the game. At this point, their game starts to take all their creative juices, producing some amazing stories. The problem is, all the great stuff is happening in their game, and the stories and scripts for the show really start to suffer. <br/><br/>That's the hook. The show is about to be cancelled, but some of the writers don't seem to be as bothered, as they are creating some great stories for "their game". <br/><br/>Another set of actors (in the movie) will be playing the fictional characters in the show/game and the actors in the show. They have their own agenda and want to keep their paying acting jobs. Meanwhile, the characters in the RPG are starting to become self-aware. More problems.<br/><br/>Yes, this is complicated, but I don't care. It would be an awesome movie. I'm going to need Charlie Kaufman's help with the script though. Maybe Paul Thomas Anderson can direct.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331696/#Comment_331696" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T10:56:55+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 10:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously though, let's make Alon's movie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331700/#Comment_331700" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T11:30:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 11:30AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zircher</cite>the the big hairy guy that plays the competent swordswoman (I always like Michelle Yeoh for those roles).</blockquote>\nDood, Jack Black or Philip Seymour Hoffman brushing cheetohs crumbs off his big-ass beard with Michelle Yeoh as his PC would be brilliant!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331704/#Comment_331704" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T12:14:14+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 12:14PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (more in the cheezy action vein)<br/><br/>Forest of Swords<br/><br/>Alex Kelso desperately needs a break from her life, her job, and her disappointing relationship, so when her brother Robert invites her to a weekend-long boffer larp in the woods with him and his best friend Maxwell James, she thinks "why not, what could go wrong?"<br/><br/>A few days of camping out and dressing up, riding horses, quaffing mead, and hitting each other with foam weapons seems like the very opposite of her too-serious life in the city, Alex soon realizes her brother Robert is driven by a fantasy quest of his own. The real reason he's moved back into their parent's basement and only works part time at the local bike repair shop is because he spends all his time in training. This is the weekend he intends to claim the title of East Coast Renaissance Swordfighting Champion from it's current holder, Lilian Wu!<br/><br/>Alex is soon bewitched herself by Lilian, who seems to be equally at home behind the DM screen and the tavern bar as she is on the fencing grounds. But when our four heroes try lugging their ale barrels through the forest for the Saturday night party, they witness a horrible crime. A group of local neo-Nazi survivalists have captured the daughter of local politician George Hamlin, an outspoken opponent of camping larpers.<br/><br/>Armed with their gaming-honed wits, the four attempt a rescue. When Alex and Maxwell accidentally blow up the kidnappers' meth lab, the fire spreads to their firearms stockpile, which also explodes. As the enraged skinheads circle round them with knives and machetes, Robert and Lilian stand back-to-back and draw their un-padded replica longswords...<br/><br/><br/>Actually, now that I think about it...<br/>1. After Alex accepts the invitation, Robert's girlfriend tells her she's worried about him, so Alex is already cued to his obsession with the championship title, and what he's decided to sacrifice to get it.<br/>2. They go drinking Saturday night and stumble across the kidnapping--but Maxwell gets kidnapped too, while Alex, Robert, and Lilian see only enough to follow the neo-Nazis back to their compound.<br/>3. Robert tells her this might be the annual event's last time, because this Hamlin dude is trying to get the park to shut it down. Alex thought he was too obsessed with his tough-on-crime bill to be worried about people dressing up, but he wants to clamp down on all kinds of fighting, even the fake kind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331705/#Comment_331705" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T12:28:26+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 12:28PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Can we workshop some of these ideas, too, Joe?

The episode where they all go to a convention.<br/><br/>I think that Rachel should be living just below poverty line, before she starts writing the fantasy series.<br/>I think that her success with the fantasy series should put her on bestseller lists (and thus, a comfortable income).<br/>The group thinks she's making millions off their creative genius, but in reality, she's just hit comfortably middle class.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331706/#Comment_331706" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T12:28:54+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 12:28PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2011 12:35PM by Mcdaldno.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, <b><i>Saving Throw</i></b> is absolutely the best idea so far.<br/><br/>Who could play Mitch?

There's already a strong image of the D&amp;D geek imbedded in the collective mind. You need to address the problem.. and then attack it.<br/><br/>In the movie's first act.. many of the characters are "Hollywood Ugly." You can see imperfections in their faces.. Kiera Knightly is flatchested (well, she is!) Their clothing is careless, In their adventures, their looks are overly idealized. The fat guy in the group has bulging muscles. Kiera Knightly has D cups.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, their friendship deepens and they become more social. They begin to pay better attention to their appearance and show more confidance in real life. The appearance of their characters become more realistic as their outer and inner lives match up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331789/#Comment_331789" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T23:09:38+00:00" title="June 26, 2011 11:09PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2011 11:11PM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my "when I win the lottery" projects has been to actually make <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?168047-Prime-Time-Adventures-Dungeon-Majesty" rel="nofollow">this</a>.  <br/><br/>My "official" pitch would probably be Out of the Dungeon.  Originally pitched as a PTA game...\n<blockquote><br/>25 years ago <i>[when I originally wrote this]</i>, in 1980, eight kids in your town disappeared. It was a fairly high profile disappearance, linked with Dungeons and Dragons, and played right into the hysteria going around at the time. The kids were involved in a D&amp;D game; one of them was the dungeon master. The press, of course, ate it up. No bodies were ever found, and eventually it was forgotten, at least by everyone not friends and family of the kids.<br/><br/>You don't know any of those kids or their friends or families.<br/><br/>What you (the protagonists) don't know is this: those kids disappeared into the world of their roleplaying game.<br/><br/>Nothing happens in a vacuum. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, especially in a mystical sense. In order for those kids to disappear to another world, something had to come from that world to replace them.<br/><br/>That would be their player characters.<br/><br/>The protagonists' parents.<br/><br/>What you (the protagonists) do know is that your parents seem to have been immigrants from somewhere (depending on who asks, sometimes it's Poland, sometimes it's Hungary, though your names are neither Hungarian nor Polish).

Because, you know, the game is how most of us want to live our lives: we go out into the world, and we do stuff to change it. Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we fail. That's why we roll the dice most of the time, and it's called a skill roll: Can you climb that steep wall into the dark tower? Can you stop the dark ritual before it's too late? Can you sneak past the sleeping dragon without waking him up? that's up to you and your skills.<br/><br/>But saving throws are a whole different thing. Sometimes, life just throws things your way, and it's not about succeeding or failing, it's just about surviving whatever bad things are in store for you. Do you survive the long fall down the window of the dark tower? Can you remain standing after the Manticore trips you with its tail? Can you control yourself when the demon whispers a command into your ear? That's what a saving throw is for.<br/><br/>So, to recap, Gullivan's been struck with the goblin's arrow, and now there's poison cruising down your veins. Can you press on, or do you collapse helplessly on the cold, hard ground?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331831/#Comment_331831" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T06:44:56+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  6:44AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Sears</cite><br/>In my opinion, the general public isn't going to buy that vision.

Perhaps I didn't make my position clear enough. Let's turn this into a Real discussion.<br/><br/>First of all.. when I said that the characters should be "Hollywood Ugly," I did not mean that they should be stereotypical geeks and nerds. "Hollywood Uglies" are actually attractive people that could use a makeover. You know the girl in the teen romantic comedies where the girl just takes off her glasses and gets a new hairdo and she's suddenly a hottie? That's what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Do attractive people roleplay? Of course they do. Is this the norm? Really attractive people aren't actually "normal" to begin with.<br/><br/>So, to have the integrity that you are looking for, the characters begin as fairly ordinary looking people. They should be likeable. Maybe one or two of them may turn some heads, but wouldn't have the impact of a supermodel in full makeup. The main characters would have a personal problem. Even models can have a lack of confidence when it comes to dealing with other people.<br/><br/>The general movie plot is about personal transformation. Movies are a visual medium, so it is most effective to show the changes the characters undergo through their appearance, both in the the real world and in the inner world that they create together.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332015/#Comment_332015" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T00:07:59+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 12:07AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mcdaldno's and elkin's movie pitches appear to be more about the transformation of the main character, the outsider, the non-gamer. The gamers provide the vehicle for the personal transformation, but don't necessarily transform themselves. <br/><br/>If I have read their pitches correctly, this was intentional. The gamers don't have interior issues, aren't "flawed" in that sense, and are technically "perfect", thus providing the main protagonist the means to become a better person. That's one way to provide a "positive" image of the RPGer.<br/><br/>I see a second method in Keith's suggestions. Start off with flawed characters with their physical imperfections as RPGers. They bond and/or grow using gaming as a medium. They come out at the end of the movie better, showing that RPGs/the activity can provide a medium of growth. <br/><br/>The third method would be to have gaming be simply a tertiary thing that the characters do, like any other hobby, like playing poker on a night without the kids, so much so that it becomes background and something that people do, and not something that's a "big deal".<br/><br/>Or that's how I see this exercise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332029/#Comment_332029" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T05:28:31+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  5:28AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brennen Reece</cite>I'm in the "hot, but balding" category.</blockquote>\nThis had me laughing because at first I thought you were replying to the XXXXtreme comment.
