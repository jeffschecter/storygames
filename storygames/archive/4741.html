A friend and I are doing something kinda fun right now, so I thought I would share it with ya'll.  The two of us went down to Endgame in Oakland, CA for their 6th Anniversary party on the 27th.  My friend, Jeremy Tidwell (who did a lot of the photography for Finis), bought a set of dominoes and jokingly threw down a little challenge.  By the time we got back home the next day, we both had some game ideas and decided to seriously challenge ourselves.<br/><br/>The only constraint is that we have to use dominoes in the game.  We're giving ourselves the month of November to do it.  That won't have the crazy, frenzied designing that other contests have, but we're both looking for something kinda chill.<br/><br/>I'm working on a game I'm tentatively calling War Stories, which is a story game and telling two sides of a war.  It's a two-player game where you draw dominoes to set up your various characters in the story, and you play our battles by playing dominoes.  Each leg off the spinner represents a different element of a battle, like the front lines, the command tent, the spies, the people at home, something like that.  My goal is that the game is about individuals on both sides and how the war changes them.  My inspiration for this started from looking at dominoes standing up and thinking about them as people -- both of the numbers on them being stats.  Then a few cognitive leaps later, I came to this idea.  (I think watching a lot of BSG lately as influenced my "war story" view.)<br/><br/>Jeremy's working on a competitive game about meddling time travelers.  I don't know much about his game right now, but his inspiration for this I know comes from looking at a game of dominoes and seeing how doubles are played on the table.  That sparked the idea of a split in time, and combined with watching a lot of Dr. Who, he came to this time meddlers idea.<br/><br/><b>But that all just leads up to the important question:</b>  What sort of role-playing/story game would you make with dominoes?<br/><br/>If you feel like joining us in our little challenge, awesome.  But unlike the various "contests" our there, this is more of a self-challenge.  Even if not, though, I would love to hear what sort of domino-centric ideas you have.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106860/#Comment_106860" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T17:24:53+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  5:24PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My game <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/files/City%20of%20Masks%20Storygame.pdf" rel="nofollow">City of Masks</a> uses dominoes, as much for the pun (domino masks) as for any real reason.
