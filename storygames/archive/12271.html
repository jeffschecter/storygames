Illustrated by very skilled artist Basia Marek, this game allows players to roleplay a "shared dreaming" experience, while saving the world of the Day.<br/>\n<br/>\nDirect links [edit: better hosting, final version of files, no major bugs]:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.zshare.net/download/770673834388da02/" rel="nofollow">Sourcebook High Quality 12MB</a><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.zshare.net/download/77067451e697e4fd/" rel="nofollow">Normal Version 5MB</a><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.zshare.net/download/770675658cc98607/" rel="nofollow">Dreamer Sheet 2MB</a><br/>\n<br/>\nInto Dreams is a first free "pen&amp;paper;" role-playing game project developed under my <b>Proud Works</b> logo. Check the website at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.proud-works.com/" rel="nofollow">www.Proud-Works.com</a>.<br/>\nThis game is licensed under <b>Creative Commons</b> license, so if you'll like it, you can share it with whoever you like, even by mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main idea of Into Dreams is a mechanic, that serve as a console to role-play short sessions (dreams) set in many different worlds, settings, with random looks and feels. One dream session can be 5 to 45 minutes long, and creating (and sharing) Dreams is easy like a pie. Moreover - it's highly encouraged to role-play the same Dream with the same players for a few times, because knowing what will happen doesn't make the story weaker at all, since players can shift the Dreamscape at their whim, Record entities, items and even whole scenes to use later and search for extras, artifacts and Keys they missed first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDownload the sourcebook and character sheet from Proud Works. While being there, be sure to see the Into Dreams <b>flash </b>website too!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo please - read the book, try the game. I think I've concieved something <b>new </b>, something <b>fresh </b>here, and I really want to get your opinion on it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275114/#Comment_275114" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T07:24:01+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  7:24AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your all-Flash Web site is sort of hard to use.

There, they have to find way out, into next, more complex Dream. To do this, they must find Keys, and those can be anything. Kinda like portal keys in Sigil, but even more complex.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they have limited time to solve the riddles of the Dream, and clash with the Obstacles (four kinds of skill tests) to find the Keys and the Gate to next Dream. And there may be no logic in it at all! They will have to quickly get the rules of any Dream (if there are any) or create their own. And they might not "win" with the first try - there is no penalty for that. You die in Dream? You wake up. It's entering too deep they are worried about.<br/>\n5 minutes sessions (mostly Dreams consisting of one or two Scenes) are exciting. When I say "go!" I actually turn on a stopwatch. But the real fun starts, when players already know this Dream, and know what to expect. You can hear incredible declarations then:<br/>\n<br/>\n"<i>OK. Annah - you fly and get that goldfish from the tree! James and I - we go fight off the ID Demons, while Zack creates two Keys from the Giant's hair! Go!</i>"<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that purposeful and joyous replayability of each Dream is what excites me most about this game.<br/>\nOr the moment, where players choose which Dream to play:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>A:</b><i>"Lets do the Pink Widow again!"</i><br/>\n<b>B:</b><i>"Pervert."</i><br/>\n<b>C:</b><i>"Yeah, enough of this. We should go for Mountain of Swords and finally finish that b****."</i><br/>\n<b>A:</b><i>"Fantasy again? Boooring... There are no chicks in Mountain."</i><br/>\n<b>C:</b><i>"Sigh... Then how about Blindead?"</i><br/>\n<b>B:</b><i>"No way! You guys know I don't do nightmares!"</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so on...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
