Yay!  but I've got a couple questions:<br/>\n1) When/how do I find out where all these games I signed up for are?<br/>\n2) Do people in the dealers room generally take credit cards?<br/>\n3) What should I be asking that I don't know enough to even ask?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120780/#Comment_120780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T14:58:01+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  2:58PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Patty, <br><br>There's a gigantic wall with all the games printed out on it, for late sign-ups and standby and so forth, and it also tells you which table your game will be at.  That's how it was last year.  They put all our games in the same space, so it's very easy to just stumble in, look for somebody you know is in your session, and sit down to play.  It's not at all hard to find your game.  <br><br>I'd plan on cash for the dealer's hall, which is pretty modest.  <br><br/>Here's a question you should be asking:<br/><br/>What happens if I have down time?<br/><br/>Answer:  Find some people and start a pick-up game.  The layout will be different this year (new hotel), but there will be a knot of fellow travelers, probably hanging out near the IPR booth and preventing customers from buying stuff, and you can grab a couple and start a game or just a conversation.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somelady" title="somelady"><img alt="somelady" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somelady">somelady</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120788/#Comment_120788" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T15:35:57+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  3:35PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks Jason, that all makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
