More than saying "we're playing in Waterworld and the Drivers all have speedboats", but less than Dungeon World.<br/><br/>I'm sufficiently impressed by AW's system and usability to try it for lots of other stuff, and I'm also curious to see how much mileage I can get out minor changes because I'm lazy.

This would playing along the lines of Bernard Cornwell's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enemy of God </span>or Philip Reeve's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here Lies Arthur</span>, where Arthur is an amibitious warlord with a great PR machine that ties him in to the dreams of past glories.  I remember one scene in Cornwell's book where Arthur is sitting before a battle in an old cottage with a lead roof, musing that they used to actually mine lead in Northumbria, and now they can barely keep the roofs fixed, and that if he can fix things, he'll get the mines going again and make Britain rich.  Except there's a million Saxons in the way of his plan.<br/><br/>Probably not much actual hacking needed, the Maelstrom becomes the Spirit World, the Gunlugger becomes a big bastard with a sword. Probably needs a Druid playbook that's a mashup of the Brainer and Hocus playbooks.  Holdings are still holdings, gangs are warbands.  The Driver is probably hosed, since everybody rides horses in this setting unless you can tweak the moves to represent a guy with really excellent cavalry skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295247/#Comment_295247" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T14:52:41+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  2:52PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games I'm already thinking about playing with Apocalypse World with some slight hacking:<br/><br/>-- Rifts, because it's so easy: a Glitterboy is a Driver, a Baby Dragon is NOT TO BE FUCKED WITH<br/>-- crusaderpunk stuff like Engel or Wormwood or any other church-y knights fight demonic invasion setting (40K?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295250/#Comment_295250" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T14:58:15+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  2:58PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm already trying to get my head around doing <i>Night Witches</i>, but that's probably more hack-ish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295254/#Comment_295254" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T15:03:47+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  3:03PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm starting a roller derby &amp;

Their sex move, which I originally suggested, is that, when they have sex, they stop being a child, which Johnstone says means they switch playbooks but I was originally thinking it just meant they pick a new sex move from another playbook.  Engel perhaps shouldn't get a sex move to start but can purchase one with higher advances, yeah?  And they should have a mandatory "retire your character to puberty" advance at some point, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295297/#Comment_295297" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T21:32:03+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  9:32PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Winter of '41-42, occupied Ukraine.

Young aristocrats, mainly men, from Northern Europe embark on their rite of passage across Europe. Their journeys will take them to the greatest cities in the world, educate them in art, history and culture - and the pleasures of the flesh - and in the end make or break them. The practice was introduced by the three super powers at that time - the English, the Prussians and the Danes - but other nationalities soon followed and it became a tradition for the offspring of the European ruling classes. The Grand Tour was not just a recreational and educational trip, it was a matter of showing and maintaining cultural power.

Which playbooks disappear, which ones need to be added? Would you MC it differently?  Does the Maelstrom work differently?<br/><br/>That said, here's another idea:<br/><br/><b>Apocalypse Space</b><br/><br/>There's that connection between AW and Firefly, this idea turns it on its head and feeds it back into science fiction.  There are lots of ways to do this -- you could take Battlestar Galactica and practically run it off the shelf -- but I was thinking of taking a lot of color and ideas from Star Trek.  I've never played a good game of Star Trek in any version, but maybe it would work AW-style.  Probably borrow some elements from Asimov's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foundation Trilogy</span>, set it in the collapse of the Foundation/Empire/whatever, in that exciting part where sector commanders are calling themselves kings, admirals are trying to become emperor, and individual fleet captains are going rogue or turning pirate.  The PC's will be starfleet officers who've fled the galactic core to avoid getting pulled into the civil war that's about to break out, they've got elite skills, a nice ship with serious resupply problems, no clear path to the future and lots of local powers and potentates that see them as a threat or opportunity or resource to be stolen.  <br/>Other sources: Dune, Red Dwarf.  Any of those stories where the cosmos is big and lonely and there's nobody out there but other humans.  <br/><br/>I'd almost like to make the ship + ship's computer a character of its own.  By picking your moves, you decide what kind of ship you're playing and what its issues are.   On the other hand, that sort of violates the "no aliens" rule, so it might be better to have a "Captain" playbook that covers this.  I'm torn, it obviously needs to be a group decision what kind of ship, but usually there's a level of identification between the Captain and his/her ship than any other character.  Taking some inspiration from the Chopper and Hardholder playbooks to help characterize the ship, crew, and their strengths and weaknesses.  <br/><br/>I suppose you could also let each of the playbooks taken help define the ship, the same way they help define the setting in the standard game of AW.  So if you've got a science officer, the ship's got some scientific function.  If there's a Viper Pilot, then the ship has fighters on board like the Galactica or a fighter escort.<br/><br/>I'd reshape some of the other playbooks, maybe reducing Weird and playing up Sharp.<br/>Hardholder becomes Captain, I think.  <br/>Brainer becomes Science Officer and gets some kind of "Analyze" move to figure out new situations.<br/>Savvyhead becomes Engineer, keeps the quasi-mystical attachment to their stuff but also a move for improvising things MacGuyver-style.<br/>Chopper becomes Viper Pilot, leader of a squadron of little fighting ships that go off and do their own thing. Works pretty much as written, <br/>Driver becomes Warp Pilot, navigating the ship and knowing about other star systems.  Maybe more weird stuff here, if you go with a Dune-like tie between space navigation and psychic powers.<br/>Angel is Medical Officer, pretty much as written<br/>Gunlugger could be Security Officer, with some significant changes to represent the change from solo badass to leader of the redshirts.  He should have a move that allows him to find out more about a threat by sacrificing one of his guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295395/#Comment_295395" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T13:24:51+00:00" title="September 30, 2010  1:24PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been contemplating a <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=402.0" rel="nofollow">hack for the setting of Shadowrun</a> (though not exactly a Shadowrun hack, if you follow me).

During this period more than half of Iran's population was killed, turning the streets of Persian cities such as Neishabur into "rivers of blood", as the severed heads of men, women, and children were "neatly stacked into carefully constructed pyramids around which the carcasses of the city's dogs and cats were placed". Between 1220 and 1260, the total population of Iran had dropped from 2,500,000 to 250,000 as a result of mass extermination and famine."<br/><br/>Ancient systems of irrigation, which had been built up since about 2000 BC were destroyed, and it wasn't until the 1700s that the population recovered. Entire regions of Khorasan, which before the invasions had been one of the world centers of art, culture, and learning never recovered and became nomadic grazing grounds to the current time. <br/><br/>Plus, a lot of the playbooks can be converted over fairly easily.

Plus <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lord of the Rings</span>.  Also the Bill and Ted movies and the Harold and Kumar movies. Maybe a little Butch and Sundance action.   Basically a series of picaresque adventures in increasingly surrealistic post-Apocalyptic America which get more intense and dangerous as the guys power up, without ever losing a basic sense of absurdity and black humor. <br/><br/>No need for different playbooks -- a Gunlugger and a Driver would work nicely, but I might have to change how Fronts work to adapt to a game where the characters keep moving West and never, never turn back.<br/>EDIT: This would be awesome to run or play for two characters in person or via Skype, if I only had the time...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296016/#Comment_296016" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T19:33:38+00:00" title="October  5, 2010  7:33PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>I might have to change how Fronts work to adapt to a game where the characters keep moving</blockquote>\nI think that would be an excellent and useful hack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296021/#Comment_296021" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T21:27:22+00:00" title="October  5, 2010  9:27PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crap I totally forgot this thread existed.

The locals are hostile and mysterious and the fauna are dangerous and poorly understood. That's where the Imperial Police send criminals too dangerous for normal prisons, and the Navy and Army strand their own when they've become politically difficult or awkward.  There's a single spaceport  which is used only by Navy ships, and a few smugglers who land in the arid wastes, and neither one takes passengers.  <br/><br/>The sources here are Star Wars plus its direct inspiration, Dune, plus the Cordwainer Smith stories.  And, of course, Warhammer 40K which I don't like but everyone else does.  Maybe a little bit of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, for when all the PC's get their own gangs.  <br/><br/>Playbooks needed: <br/><br/>Disgraced Military Officer<br/>Exiled Aristocrat<br/>Practioner of Forbidden Cultish Practices<br/>Fallen Criminal Mastermind<br/>Bounty Hunter<br/>Disfavored Courtesan<br/>Stranded Smuggler<br/><br/>As part of chargen, each player should detail what they did to get stuck on this hell-world.  Also, based on chargen, the MC should decide: <br/>What's Going On With The Empire;<br/>What's Going On With The Planet.<br/><br/>There should be one of each: for example, in Dune, the Empire is going through an attempt to liquidate House Atreides, the Planet is going through a secret movement of the indigenous people to liberate themselves and transform their planet.<br/><br/>Depending on that, the Maelstrom-equivalent should become clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299817/#Comment_299817" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T13:22:27+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  1:22PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jumping in on the thread Necromancy!<br/><br/>I cooked up a few minor tweaks for a non-apocalyptic Western game, the main sticking point being the brainer and maelstrom. <br/><br/>I also think Necromunda would work with nothing but color tweaks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor" title="GregPogor"><img alt="GregPogor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_e5387V2_bKU/TVEgYJ8ZWtI/AAAAAAAAAcw/CFb4Akfg5SE/avatar_storygame_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor">GregPogor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330824/#Comment_330824" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T09:47:44+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  9:47AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2011 9:48AM by GregPogor.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holey moley thread necromancy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld5upa1wnsE" rel="nofollow">This seems to be an appropriate setting.</a> Maybe after we finish the current campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
