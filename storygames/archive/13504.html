Sometimes only one relationship amongst many is really at stake, unlike in a soap opera like Smallville tries to emulate.  In team comics, it's the Values of the members of the team that are put to the test.<br/><br/>This means that Trouble has to carry the conflict more in games set around teams.  But there's a bigger problem than Trouble - sometimes there just isn't a Relationship that's really at stake or squarely in the center of the conflict.<br/><br/>So here's something to use Smallville for a game based more around Values conflicts than around Values and Relationships.<br/><br/>First, you lay out a Mission Track in the middle of the table. It looks like a Stress Track:<br/><br/>d4    d6     d8    d10     d12<br/><br/>Second, when designing the scenario, the GM looks at the Leads' Values and designs a villain and scenario to challenge them.  The GM writes out exactly 4 steps in the villains' plan, or events in the crisis if they aren't a planner.<br/><br/>Third, put another piece of paper, covering up the Mission Track except for the d4. Put a marker on the d4.<br/><br/>In play, when people can't think of a good Relationship to use, they can use the current Mission Track, to reflect their characters' participation in the team.  The Value is still the same, and drives most of the motivation.  If there's a Relationship that applies more, you use the Relationship as normal.<br/><br/>The leader of the team writes a Mission Statement for the team as soon as they figure out what's going on.  The Mission Statement is likely short and very general at this point.  "Stop Gorilla Grodd".  "Solve the mystery of the red ribbon killer." Or whatever.<br/><br/>When the villain achieves something on his list, the GM slides the paper covering the Track to the right, revealing the next die type.  This means that the leader of the team can attempt to move the Mission marker up.  The leader rewrites the Mission Statement, as the team responds to its setbacks and the villain's plan advancing.  The GM rolls the Trouble pool, and sums the highest of each of the die types.  So if there's 3d4, 2d6 and 1d8 in the Trouble pool, the GM adds the highest d4, d6 and the d8 together.  If the leader wins, then the mission marker moves up one.  If not, the leader may attempt again once the team decides it needs to plan a new Mission Statement.<br/><br/>More about the team leader coming in next post, along with an example...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305045/#Comment_305045" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T23:49:33+00:00" title="December 17, 2010 11:49PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bless you, sir.

If you do this, you can have direct Mission vs Mission aspects to the big team battles.

In some situations this is super mega obvious. In others it is not so?  Suffice to say that under normal circumstances, pretty much everyone knows who the leader of the team is.  But if you're not sure, look at who has the highest Asset related to leadership or people skills.  If there's more than one person who's tied, you can have a juicy Conflict about it, or you might want to just pick someone, for badass reasons I will detail below.<br/><br/>In this case, let's say Charlie has his Business School Student asset at d8, and that's the closest any of these weirdos has to a leadership skill. Cool, Charlie's the team leader.<br/><br/>Charlie writes the Mission Statement for the team before anything even happens. It should be super general, like:<br/><br/>"Stop Crime And Save People In Liberty City"<br/><br/>We put down the Mission Track, cover it so only the d4 is up, and put a marker on the d4.<br/><br/>Now let's say Jet and Charlie are tooling along and they come across some asshole with a ray gun holding up a shoe store. They swing into action to beat him down.  This guy is nobody special, so the GM is just rolling Trouble, as the GM would with anyone who wasn't anyone special.  Our heroes will be rolling the Value they're expressing with their defense of the shoe store.  Jet: Glory d10, "That's world famous reporter Kat Farrell in there being held hostage! I'll get a headline for sure!", Charlie Justice d6 "Those people didn't ask to be threatened..."  But none of their relationships really sing out to anyone as being at stake in this situation.  Jet could spend a plot point to establish a temporary Relationship with, say, Farrell, but let's say he doesn't want to or doesn't have any plot points laying around.  Since what they're doing is very much in line with the mission, they can roll the current Mission die instead, which is a d4.<br/><br/>Replace them with Jet and Wolfgang, and maybe Jet is still rolling the Mission die, but Wolfgang might be rolling his Relationship with Jet instead, "I can't let that little guy get hurt!"  Really, the point of the Mission die is to give something that shows the character's relationship to what the team is currently trying to do, IF there is no other relationship that really applies.<br/><br/>Next, ENAMY ACTION, I mean ENEMY ACTION.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305128/#Comment_305128" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-19T08:16:16+00:00" title="December 19, 2010  8:16AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2010 11:31AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So our team and Liberty City is menaced by a supervillain I played once,<br/><br/>MAKKALA THE VOLCANO GOD<br/><br/>An obscure god of a distant semi-uncharted island (Howard Hughes knew where it was), Makkala wears a flower-print shirt, sunglasses (to hide his red-glowing eyes), and other than virgin sacrifices, he loves drinks with umbrellas in them, his on-again off-again water spirit girlfriend La Ni\xf1a, and chillaxin' with his earth elemental homies.  Jet picked his pocket of a virgin sacrifice one time, using a loophole in the ritual (not the one you think) and Makkala has sworn revenge, plus he really doesn't care for most of modern society, it having paved over everything.<br/><br/>Values: Duty d4 "I'm a god, what are you gonna do?", Glory d10 "Worship me!", Justice d8 "Revenge is sweet", Love d6 "She and I have chased each other since the world was cooling", Truth d8 "A god doesn't have to lie!", Power d6 "I already have all I need"<br/><br/>Relationships include Jet d6 "That little sack of water has annoyed me for too long" and Charlie d8 "He's meant to be on my side"<br/><br/>When introducing Makkala to the situation, I write down four things he is after in his current plan, in order:<br/><br/>* Obtain the elemental crystall of Nyarr<br/>* Build a cult to worship him<br/>* Obtain a virgin sacrifice<br/>* Perform the ritual that will subsume Liberty City in a caldera of lava<br/><br/>WHAT GETS PLAYED?<br/><br/>Normally the first thing the villain tries to do, he just achieves off-screen - the heroes are too late to stop him, but they can gain clues about who's responsible or what's going on.  And normally the last thing the villain tries to do, the heroes have the opportunity to directly stop via confrontation.  But you can vary this up to good effect.  Sometimes it adds to the tension if the villain carries on with his plan outside the reach of the heroes, sometimes it's annoying.<br/><br/>So I, as the GM, describe the aftermath of the robbery of the Liberty City Museum of Natural History where the crystal was being stored, the heroes investigate, gasp, it's Makkala.  I move the paper covering up the Mission Track to expose the d6.  The marker doesn't move yet.<br/><br/>CHANGING THE MISSION STATEMENT/INCREASING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MISSION<br/><br/>In order for the Mission marker to move, the team leader has to succeed in a leadership roll, rolling his Value and appropriate Relationship as normal.  He has to succeed against a modified Trouble roll.  The GM rolls the Trouble pool, but may only add the highest result of each die type. So a Trouble pool with a lot of d4s and d6s is easy to beat, even if a smaller Trouble pool with a greater variety of dice might be harder.<br/><br/>If the team leader wins, he can rewrite the Mission Statement, normally to something more specific, and move the marker up one step to d6.  If the team leader fails, the Mission Statement and the Mission Track remain the same. He can try again after the team continues to try to make progress on their original Mission. Basically he has failed to convince the team that the threat the villain poses is significant enough to get them emotionally invested in beating them.<br/><br/>Let's say for our example that Charlie wins his leadership test and changes the Mission Statement to "Find Out What Makkala Is Up To And Stop It". It's still pretty general, but it gives more direction. Another example might be "Why Does Makkala Want The Nyarr Stone?" if the team is more investigative or wants to pursue a "chase" angle instead of a "confrontation" angle.  The Mission Track marker moves up to d6.<br/><br/>MINOR VILLAINY<br/><br/>Now, if Makkala was just going to be a minor annoyance or a short-term thing, I would only list one, two or three things. This means the mission can never be more important than d6, d8 or d10.  If you find yourself doing this a lot, step back and re-evaluate whether maybe you need to return to the normal Relationship-driven sorts of plots, because you're designing villains who aren't challenging either the Relationships of the Leads or the mission they've set for themselves.<br/><br/>Next, DISSENTION IN THE RANKS!!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305296/#Comment_305296" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-20T22:55:43+00:00" title="December 20, 2010 10:55PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About the four things the villain wants: what happens when the villain is thwarted on one of the steps, but not defeated?  Like, say Makkala gets the elemental crystal of Nyarr, but in phase two of his brilliant plan all of his prospective cultists are soundly thumped and handed over to the cops.  The heroes stopped his evil scheme, so the mission track and marker stay where they are, but what happens next?  Does Makkala have to keep trying to build his cult?  Or is his reign of Hawaiian-shirt-clad terror simply over?<br/><br/>Or does Makkala only need to <i>attempt</i> to get each one of the four things on his list and we just assume that by comic book logic, he will try to do without whatever pieces he's missing for his grand finale?  Like, he ended up with no cult and it was Mardi Gras weekend so there were no virgins left in town...but he'll try to make do with some agreeable winos and a live chicken when he does the ritual to vulcanize Liberty City?  Is that something that the GM should be considering when preparing a list of four things, so that losing step 2 doesn't mean that steps 3 and 4 are impossible?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305320/#Comment_305320" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T06:37:22+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  6:37AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2010 9:12AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't decided that yet.

Just as the base Smallville system supports and encourages you to act against your Values or Relationships when they are changing, the same is true here.<br/><br/>Any character can choose to act against the Mission Statement at any time after the Mission has been advanced (so, anytime the marker is not on d4).  This lets them triple the current Mission rating for that roll.  After tripling the Mission rating, the rating is stepped back by one step.<br/><br/>So let's say that Charlie is pushing an investigative approach to the mission and has a Mission Statement like "find out what's going on with the Nyarr stone", and the Mission marker is on d8.  Jet yells "You're not the boss of me" and runs out to go punch Makkala's favorite bikini-wearing henchgirl, Mai Tai Mai.  When he goes crashing, rocket skates first, through Mai Tai's mother's front window (Mai Tai lives with her mother, you gotta problem with that?) he rolls his Value of Power (motivated as he is by being convinced that his way is right), and 3d8 for the Mission dice. Then he moves the marker down to d6.<br/><br/>Okay, so we play out that scene.  The current situation is that the marker is now back on d6, although Makkala's progress is such that the d8 is uncovered.<br/><br/>For Charlie to move the marker back up to d8, he has a choice. He has to either win a conflict with Jet about getting back on the "find out what's going on" plan, or he can change his Mission Statement to incorporate Jet's idea and roll to advance the mission marker as before.  In other words, his choice is either to bend to Jet's rebellion, and try to push the Mission forward in a new direction, or to squash Jet's rebellion and try to push the Mission forward in the same direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305568/#Comment_305568" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T09:15:25+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  9:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SO here's the summary:<br/><br/>* The Mission Track is in the middle of the table, at the start, everything on it is covered up except the d4 space. Put a marker on that.<br/>* Create 4 benchmarks for the villain's plan. Each time they achieve a benchmark, move the cover of the Misison Track to reveal another die step.<br/>* Figure out who the leader is - they create a Mission Statement for the team.<br/>* A team member can roll the Mission rating instead of a Relationship rating if they don't have a Relationship that clearly applies.<br/>* The leader may advance the Mission marker to an available step if they win a test against the Trouble Pool.  The Trouble Pool is rolled and one die of each type is summed.  The leader must beat that sum.<br/>* Any team member can go against the Mission Statement on their own. If they do, they triple the Mission rating for that conflict, then step the rating back.  The leader then must either win a test against them to re-advance with the same Mission Statement, or change the Mission Statement and advance it as normal.<br/><br/>Thoughts I'm still working on:<br/><br/>* Villain Missions?

They could roll the current Mission rating just as well as anyone else could.<br/><br/>Leonard, Cam, I was thinking about your idea about villains rolling the Mission rating, or having their own rating or something? At first I wasn't enamored of the idea because even in most "team" comics, the bad guy continues to do his thing because of Relationships and Values, not necessarily out of allegiance to a bad-guy team.  But then I thought of a counterexample: the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants/Hellfire Club/Emma Frost's teenaged mutant training team whose name I forget/pretty much any 1990s X-Men bad guy team.  There was always some poor shlub who was important enough to have Values, some development of their own (i.e. it elevated him above just being general Trouble or an Extra), but whose Relationships weren't really detailed.<br/><br/>My main question that I'm trying to answer here is whether the villains' Mission rating should step up from d4 as the heroes does, or whether it should step down from some higher rating to a lower rating as time goes on.<br/><br/>On the one hand, the villain's power inevitably escalates over the course of the plotline, so a bigger die type would seem warranted...<br/><br/>On the other hand, the heroes beat down the villain a bit, so maybe going the other way would be warranted?<br/><br/>For simplicity's sake, maybe the villain could use the same Mission rating as the heroes, and that could have some interesting consequences. But when someone on the hero's team rebels, why would the villains' Mission rating be changed as a result of that?<br/><br/>More thoughts are welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306488/#Comment_306488" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T15:41:33+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  3:41PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I worked on this some more with my Secret Pal who helps me with these things, and we concluded:<br/><br/>* If you <i>really need to</i>, a villain who doesn't have an applicable Relationship can roll the highest exposed die on the Mission Track.<br/><br/>* Some villains should be able to "recover" from a step in the plan being stopped by the heroes.

So as the game goes on you will be rolling the Mission more and more and Relationships less and less.<br/><br/>There is something good about this: "we all have to pull together and focus on the mission!" is part and parcel of the source material. <br/><br/>HOWEVER<br/><br/>There is also something bad about this: in those moments is when the Relationships of the characters are heightened and take center stage.<br/><br/>SO<br/><br/>Here is my proposed change:<br/><br/>If you have an applicable Relationship, and you're pursuing the Mission Statement, you can roll BOTH the Mission die AND the Relationship die if you so choose.  (You may decide not to, in order to avoid Complications.)<br/><br/>That way, near the end of the game, you might be rolling d8 for the mission AND d8 for your Relationship with the twerp kid who is being threatened by the Volcano God, with stronger possibilities for big outcomes.<br/><br/>This also means that Features DEFINITELY should be rolling the highest exposed Mission Die if they are part of the villains' plan, in addition to their own Relationships. Otherwise they'll get blown away way too fast.<br/><br/>Let me know what you all think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315535/#Comment_315535" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T23:23:35+00:00" title="March  4, 2011 11:23PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2011 11:31PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm honestly having a hard time wrapping my head around that.  It seems to me that at the end of the game, you'd have a couple of different situations:<br/><br/>1. A character with a strong applicable relationship gets to roll that relationship die AND the (presumably high) mission die along with all the other stuff, making it more likely that they get a high score.  Mind you, their opposition is also rolling a relationship and possibly a higher mission die, so on average it'll be a wash, or maybe favor the bad guys just a bit.  Everyone's throwing more dice around, but not a lot is changing.<br/><br/>2. A character with no real applicable relationships (the very character the mission bolt-on is supposed to help) is still basically just rolling the mission die with the other stuff, only now he's going head-to-head with a Feature who's getting a possibly-higher mission die AND a relationship (which, if the GM's doing it right, will totally be strong and very applicable), making it more likely that the character just loses. every. time.<br/><br/><br/>Maybe instead of a mission track that just goes all the way up to d12, the mission should come pre-capped:  it can never go higher than some central relationship, whichever relationship is the most threatened by or the most crucial to the story.  Just being on the same team can't make a character care more about the mission than the guy the mission is <i>for</i> cares about it, right?  The GM's still using the villains to strike directly at some character's relationships and values.  If no one has a relationship threatened by the villain that goes higher than d8, then the most the mission can ever matter to anyone is d8.<br/><br/>(And maybe, if at some point in the story it develops that one character successfully applies a higher-rated relationship to the mission's goals -- something Makkala did puts Doctor Temporus in grave danger, so grave that Charlie remembers "He's the only one that can really help me" and now for Charlie <i>this is why he must stop Makkala</i>, the cap slides up to a d10, because now Charlie is the character who is most invested in what's going on.  If the team can revise their mission statement to accommodate that new, we-must-save-Doctor-Temporus goal, the leader might be able to increase the mission die to a d10 and let everyone on the team care as much about this situation as Charlie does.)<br/><br/>I don't know, though, I'm just rambling.  I really love the basic concept: the whole mission statement thing is a brilliant way to pull a team together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315537/#Comment_315537" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T23:31:28+00:00" title="March  4, 2011 11:31PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Similar to AfT's confusion--this new twist seems irrelevant.

I'm also thinking that, really, it's better for the <i>character</i> to bring it back to a value or a relationship by the end of everything, because missions are ephemeral and relationships aren't.<br/><br/>It's entirely possible that just saying "If you can roll a relationship, you must" is all that's needed.

When Alfred has been kidnapped, Batman's concern for Alfred will always override the mission:  sometimes this will be to his benefit (the mission isn't that big a deal and having Alfred on his mind keeps him focused), sometimes not (the mission is of critical importance but he is endlessly distracted with worry for the old man who raised him).  Either way, the point of that story for Batman <i>is</i> Alfred, for better or worse, and the rest of the Justice League will have to eat his dust or pick up the slack, depending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315543/#Comment_315543" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-05T00:00:06+00:00" title="March  5, 2011 12:00AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, as for weirdness, Smallville always involves a bit of a judgment call on whether a Relationship applies. It'd probably always be possible to wring some tortured explanation for why a relationship applies to about any action. The assumption is that you'll roll them when they apply <i>well.</i> So you wouldn't tell a player "well, you <i>could </i>always say that this mission is driving your actions like Annabelle is driving your heart, so <i>clearly </i>you must roll the Relationship." I guess the rule could be best stated, "If you can <i>non-crappily</i> roll a relationship, you must." <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315558/#Comment_315558" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-05T07:39:17+00:00" title="March  5, 2011  7:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the crappy, tortured justifications for rolling a Relationship are what I'm trying to avoid with this whole bolt-on.

Although everyone hates and fears mutants, they are open to changing their minds, seeing new experiences, and dealing with situations as they come rather than making gross generalizations.<br/><br/>d6 - The Hellions Are Right! Rowdy mutant delinquents and criminals cause overreactions from law enforcement and other authorities, and peaceful mutants can expect the same kind of unfair treatment.<br/><br/>d8 - The Hellfire Club Is Right!  Sinister mutants are making major plays and disrupting human activities.  They may even launch small coups in obscure countries or take over human institutions.  Humanity fights back with deputized superbeings and turns to religion for comfort.<br/><br/>d10 - The Brotherhood Is Right!  Outright war between humanity and mutantkind takes place on at least the skirmish level.  Armed conflicts between militant mutants and angry humans dominate the news.<br/><br/>d12 - The Morlocks Are Right!  Humanity kicks the shit out of mutants.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>d12 - Apocalypse Was Right!  Mutants kick the shit out of humanity.<br/><br/>In this version, the player characters are trying very hard to keep things at a level where there's a ton of complications, but as things get worse they step up their game further and further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
