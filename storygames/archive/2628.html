Then the next player takes the word, changes one letter, and says their line including the new word. And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n "Gold!  Cletus, I can't believe it, after twenty years... we've struck it rich!"<br/>\n "Yeah, I really thought that Macready had sold us up the river, but here it is!"<br/>\n "It's a good thing I was bold enough to buy the map!  If you'd waffled any longer, I'm sure Gomez would have gotten it first."<br/>\n "That bald fool can't prospect to save his life."<br/>\n "Yeah, but he's good with people.  His band of buddies would have swarmed down on this place.  I hope they didn't follow us."<br/>\n "What's that on the horizon? Quick, hand me your rifle."<br/>\n "If they're expectin' anything other than a hard fight, they've got another thing coming."  (*hands over rifle*)<br/>\n "A few warning shots should ward them off!" *Fires*<br/>\n "They better 'ware your crack shot, Cletus.  And mine!"  *Fires too*<br/>\n "Lookit'um run off like a startled hare!"<br/>\n "Here's where we found our gold, and here is where we'll make our stand.  THIS LAND WILL NEVER BE YOURS, GOMEZ!"<br/>\n *Suddenly pointing the rifle at your head* "You always were a fool,  Ethan."<br/>\n "It's a good thing I wore my derringer today."  *quick draw and gut shot BANG*<br/>\n "Aghggh, that's a sore one.." *Fires, widly*<br/>\n "That's what you get, Cletus.  And don't worry... I'll make sure your wife will sire a child or two... of mine."  *bang bang*<br/>\n *Staggering, coughing blood* "I tire of you" *One final decent shot*<br/>\n "Ach.  My heart is tore..." *staggering*  "Gomez didn't need to come after us... we did ourselves in." *collapse*<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this sort of thing, for it's creative challenge, it's inherent disposability and focus, and for it's stretching of certain roleplaying muscles.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat experiences have you had with improv games? Got any good ones to suggest? Stories to share about how they''ve improved your other roleplaying? Ruminations on the extent to which games like these are RPGs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/grey.spiral" title="grey.spiral"><img alt="grey.spiral" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i148.photobucket.com/albums/s2/greySpiral/boogiepop012hushie1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/grey.spiral">grey.spiral</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60424/#Comment_60424" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T21:34:14+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  9:34PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2007 9:35PM by grey.spiral.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love short form roleplaying, but I don't have much experience with IRC.  My group has a tendency to try Call of Cthulhu in different systems anytime we are sitting around and not playing video games.  Because the mythos is a good reference point for all of us, it will often allow us to pick up different systems without needing everyone to read up on the setting material or the genre conventions of the "vanilla" setting.  <br/><br/>This has also lead us getting into improv and free form games using cheesy Lovecraft conventions, which has not been as successful.  The problem is that a number of us tend to get too wacky when we get further and further from concrete rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62513/#Comment_62513" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T18:49:28+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  6:49PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2007 6:50PM by Meserach.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did another one!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was an ABC game, starting and ending on K. Basically you do a line of dialogue at a time, starting with the next letter from the alphabet. Again, this is me and Alex. (Although my character ends up being called Alexander, as it happens.)<br/>\n<br/>\n "Kill me now.  If you're going to leave me, I'd rather be dead!"<br/>\n "Laura, please, you're making a scene!"<br/>\n "Making a scene?  I'm not the one who was making out with my sister on the pool table."<br/>\n "Never mind your sister! This is about us, Laura. Face it, we've grown apart."<br/>\n "Of course you<br/>\n would say something like that.  You're just trying to justify your actions.  But I believe we can make it!"<br/>\n "Perhaps, but we'd be fooling ourselves. I never got past Vegas, Laura. Neither did you."<br/>\n "Quit, is that what you're telling me?  That after all we've done for each other, all we've gone through, you're just going to quit?  Well screw you."<br/>\n "Run off, then. The party won't miss you."<br/>\n* Lxndr bursts into tears.<br/>\n "Sally won't ever make you half as happy as I did.  But if you want the bitch, you go ahead and take her!"<br/>\n* Meserach sips his drink.<br/>\n "True, she won't make me happy. But she won't make me miserable, either."<br/>\n "Until she gets to know you better!  Then she'll try everything in her power to make you miserable.  Just wait til I tell her EVERYTHING I know..."<br/>\n* Meserach raises an eyebrow<br/>\n "Vegas, you mean? Like that doesn't look bad for both of us."<br/>\n "Well she's my sister.  She'll forgive me long before she'd forgive you."<br/>\n* Lxndr sighs and bites her lip.<br/>\n* Meserach laughs.<br/>\n "X-chromosomes are thicker than water, eh?"<br/>\n "Y-chromosomes are too weak for me, I think.  I should look into getting a girl of my own."<br/>\n* Meserach snorts.<br/>\n "Zero chance of a threesome when we were together, and now you come out with that."<br/>\n "Alexander, baby... if I'm gonna be in bed with ANYONE, I want 100% attention.  That's something you never understood."<br/>\n "Believe me, there's a lot more I never understood about you, Laura. And a lot more I don't care to. After that night..."<br/>\n* Meserach shudders, puts down his drink and turns away.<br/>\n "Can you really still be telling yourself you're innocent?  That blood isn't just on my hands, you know."<br/>\n* Meserach turns suddenly in anger.<br/>\n "Don't even try it, Laura. Let it stay buried. Let THEM stay buried."<br/>\n "Either you stay with me, or all the skeletons come out of the closet."<br/>\n "For God's sake, Laura, I won't live a lie! All I see now when I look at you is their faces, the blood.."<br/>\n* Meserach is shaking.<br/>\n "God?  God has had nothing to do with either of us for a long, long time."<br/>\n* Lxndr spits in your eye.<br/>\n* Meserach wipes it out at length.<br/>\n "Hell's too good for you, you perverted bitch."<br/>\n "If it's too good for me, I can only imagine what kind of place they'll send YOU, you goddamned asshole."<br/>\n* Meserach pulls a gun, shakily.<br/>\n "Justice! It'll be justice... what's one more corpse, huh? I've killed before...."<br/>\n "Kill me, then... kill me and see my face every time you look at my sister.  Then we'll see how long you and Sally last."<br/>\n* Meserach fires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62515/#Comment_62515" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T19:24:27+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  7:24PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blood opera...

I hate it!"<br/>\n "Then do you have a better plan?"<br/>\n "No box! Please, father, don't make me."<br/>\n "Either get in the box, or stay behind while I go back to America, and live the dream we once shared."<br/>\n "Dreams are lies!"<br/>\n* Meserach pouts.<br/>\n "So you tell me.  But I am the one who has been to America.  It really is as beautiful as Oz."<br/>\n "Zoom to America, dreamland..."<br/>\n* Meserach makes a little airplane motion with his hand.<br/>\n "Dream it will only be, unless you come with me and Tariq."<br/>\n* Meserach sulks for a bit.<br/>\n "Quickly, then. Box hurts."<br/>\n "So it hurt me when I went.  Get in, and pray you did not dally overly."<br/>\n "You love me, daddy?"<br/>\n "Yes, my little angel.  You are my most favorite of all my daughters."<br/>\n "Sleep inside box?"<br/>\n "Xavier, it is probably best if you do sleep.  Here, drink this... it will help you stay still."<br/>\n* Meserach drinks.<br/>\n "Like drink!"<br/>\n "Kneel down now, so I can close the top of this box."<br/>\n* Meserach hits parts of the box with his hands<br/>\n "Xylophone!"<br/>\n "Excellent.  The drug works quicker than I thought.  Now..."<br/>\n* Lxndr muses.<br/>\n "Wheeeeee!"<br/>\n* Meserach continues banging the sides of the box<br/>\n "Quiet down!  Even now we embark on the next stage of the hajj..."<br/>\n "Even now we embark on the next stage of the hajj."<br/>\n "Joy! America..."<br/>\n "America..."<br/>\n* Lxndr sighs happily.<br/>\n "Angels will carry me there, daddy. They will fix me."<br/>\n "Elijah bless your words, child, and make them come true."<br/>\n "Even though I'm so very sick."<br/>\n "Killing you, the cancer is.  But there is hope, always hope...  The border patrol!  Duck!"<br/>\n* Meserach giggles.<br/>\n "Know-nothing daddy! I'm in a box, I can't duck! I can't be seen!"<br/>\n "Nevermind that, just shut up.  I think it's Agent Molotov..."<br/>\n "Very silly name, Molotov!"<br/>\n "Very silly indeed, Xavier.  Better than poor Agent Shamu..."<br/>\n* Meserach giggles again, stupidly<br/>\n "Unfortunate Shamu... she was so pretty."<br/>\n "Yes, she was.  After your mother died I'd hoped... but Molotov got her.  And she'll get us too if you don't be quiet!"<br/>\n "Terrible way to die. I'm sorry."<br/>\n* Meserach goes quiet.<br/>\n "You should be!"  *clenches his fists*  "You should have died instead of your mother.  You should have died instead of Shamu."<br/>\n* Lxndr starts weeping.<br/>\n "Unfair daddy! Not my fault I'm slow."<br/>\n* Meserach punds on the sides of the box<br/>\n "Well, no.  It is the cancer that eats your brain that does it.  But still, how many more of my loved ones will die, so that you will live?"<br/>\n "Every day for twenty years you've been my daddy. Please don't stop now."<br/>\n "Wild horses couldn't drag me away.  It is only this ache in my heart that bids me speak so."<br/>\n "Of course, daddy. I'm sorry... it is so hard."<br/>\n* Meserach stops pounding.<br/>\n "Dear, it is hard for us all."<br/>\n "Let me out of the box, daddy. I want to give you a hug."<br/>\n "Give us a little longer.  The border is almost upon us.  After that... freedom!"<br/>\n "Molotov isn't here yet! Please let me out!"<br/>\n "To let you out now will jeopardize all we have planned.  It has already bankrupted us; all I have left is my belief."<br/>\n "Freedom feels pretty much like a prison."<br/>\n* Meserach is sulky again.<br/>\n "Not for long, daughter.  For we have crossed it!  Dani is here to meet us.  Dani!"<br/>\n* Lxndr pries open the box.<br/>\n* Meserach blinks and clambers out slowly.<br/>\n "I thought I would never get out.. it was so dark."<br/>\n "Kevin and Dani will take care of you now.  I must flee - the government thinks I am but a simple chef."<br/>\n "Feels dark now, too.. feel shaky..."<br/>\n* Meserach slumps to the floor, into a sitting position.<br/>\n "Yahweh!  Do not do this, do not take my daughter from me, here on the edge of our triumph!"<br/>\n* Lxndr looks up at the sky, shaking his fists.<br/>\n "Help me, daddy, it's cold."<br/>\n "Don't think of how cold it is!  Think of America... think of our dream.  We made it..."<br/>\n* Lxndr gathers his daughter in his arms.<br/>\n "Trying..."<br/>\n* Meserach goes limp.<br/>\n "God... if you take her, take me too..."<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I ended up being a girl called Xavier.
