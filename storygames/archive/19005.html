But I don't really understand how the referee should be communicating the space of the dungeon in the first place. <br/>If they show a map to the players, then the players are only copying the referee's map, which seems tedious.<br/>If they describe the space, like you would do for a real place in the real exploration situation, then how can the players map accurately enough to use the map for the kind of strategical play that Johnstone, for exemple, often writes about ?<br/>I don't know how it can be done right.<br/><br/>So my question is : how do you handle the whole \xabmapping by the players\xbb problem ? How do you communicate the referee-side map to the players and how do the players do the mapping job in your group ?<br/>Also, do you know any old school text, either original or OSR, that gives precise advice on that matter.<br/>Thanks !                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424495/#Comment_424495" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T12:11:00+00:00" title="November 20, 2013 12:11PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes you just drop the map on the table and ask them where they go.<br/><br/>Other times you describe the best you can and the players map is just off.<br/><br/>You can also map by area.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424496/#Comment_424496" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T12:38:04+00:00" title="November 20, 2013 12:38PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Torchbearer solves this problem elegantly.

This introduces imprecision, a fog of environment similar to the fog of war. For some this, is a bug. For others a feature.<br/><br/>Here is Matthew Finch in the Appendix of <i><a href="http://www.swordsandwizardry.com/corerulesproducts.htm" rel="nofollow">Tomb of the Iron God</a></i> (a dungeon for OSR play)\n<blockquote>You should advise the player to make sure to map as they explore the dungeon. Many players will argue that it's a waste of game time to screw around with room dimensions and graph paper. However, if you really want to experience the magic of old-style gaming, don't hand wave the map. Making a map boosts the feeling of being in strange territory. It changes the whole atmosphere of the game in a subtle but powerful way. It's subtle enough, in fact, that I can't adequately describe it. This paragraph has been written and rewritten several times in an attempt to capture and characterize what maps add to an adventure session...</blockquote>\nI'm in the "It's a feature" camp, myself.<br/><br/><br/>For additional perspective from how to do this, and why to do this, here's a quote from <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14363/" rel="nofollow">one of Eero's terrific threads about D&amp;D</a>:\n<blockquote>Another example of how annoying I can be in information control is lighting conditions. I don't usually give very useful room descriptions before the players egg me on by stating out loud how their characters move forward, closer to the object of interest, raising their lanters up high. I don't know, but I imagine that most GMs would probably be pretty straightforward about giving the room description when a door is opened, but with me the players have to be pretty explicit about their positioning and use of light and/or other observational tools to get more than vague shapes and darkness out of me. I find that all this heightens the clarity the group has on the fictional positioning: we get less of "oh my character wasn't in the room, he's in the next tunnel" when we keep the communication cycles of GM narration -&gt; PC positioning -&gt; GM narration short.</blockquote>\nIn short, so much of the OSR feel is the textured poking about in the <i>tactile</i> imaginative space. You want the Players leaning in to imagine as much as possible that they might futz around with. The more you dump information onto the table, the less they have to think, "Okay, what else can we do? What else is there to touch? Is there more we should be asking the GM about?" This isn't about efficiency. It's about putting the Players in the point-of-view position of their characters (which is what any good novelist or screenwriter does anyway) and have them experience, as much as possible, walking through dark, ancient corridors as possible.<br/><br/><br/>And to loop back to Clinton's point: In an OSR, if the Players suspect their map is a bit off (let's say they suspect a secret room is adjacent to the room they're in, but want to confirm it, because the map suggests there is no room), they can certainly say, "We're going to spend some more time here really being precise." Then, in OSR style, the GM makes a ruling: Maybe if they put in another half-hour in game time they get the measurements corrected. Or they roll a d6 and every 10 minutes added to their work increases the odds by one pip. Auto-success for an hour of work. (I like that one.) That's how yo roll in OSR. Not ever situation is presented in the rules. But the Players say, "We want to try this to this effect," and the GM decides if it is at all possible, and if it is comes up with a ruling to see if it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424505/#Comment_424505" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T14:25:41+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  2:25PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In D&amp;D, we map the way Aviatrix and Christopher describe. Luke has argued in seminars on D&amp;D that mapping is the central activity of play in this sort of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>One of our house rules is that the caller and mapper (we use two mappers to hedge against errors or one of the mappers falling into a trap that destroys the map) are rotating positions. Everyone takes their turn. <br/><br/>The result is pretty amazing, IME. The maps become your lifeline -- an accurate map is essential to making sound tactical decisions, but not all mappers have the same attention to detail. And, of course, devious GMs will craft their maps to be deliberately difficult to map -- like tunnels that pass over or under each other due to slight changes in gradient (the dwarf's ability to detect changes in elevation becomes invaluable in situations like these, though clever players can determine slopes without the ability).<br/><br/>Mapping well is also a skill. Players get better at it the more they do it. In our group, we had a mix of old hands and newbies. The first session or so, the newbies were a bit annoyed with the grognards' insistence on accurate mapping and testing maps to make sure they were correct. It didn't take long for them to become fanatical about it as well.

Now either place the pieces on the table as needed or lay it all out face down and flip as needed (adding blank pieces to the edges to throw off the over-all dimensions). Leave off any features that aren't immediately noticeable and let the players draw them in when discovered. Hidden rooms and secret doors are obvious things to leave out, but consider other features such as a darkened alcove, doors and passages blocked from view by statues or tapestries. A large room may only be partly revealed until entered fully.<br/><br/>If dealing with fiddly map pieces seems a chore, simply cover the map with pieces of paper/cardboard (or even those small stones that Dollar stores carry in the craft section). Move them aside as required.<br/><br/>Give the players an incomplete "treasure" map (that they found, bought, stole, inherited) and fill it with tantalizing, inaccurate information on the dungeon/wilderness/ruins ("here there be dragons", "Standing Stone", "watch the Eye", "the stone skull LIES!"). Flip/uncover each piece as they explore it, revealing an accurate version of the roughly drawn treasure map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/twilight" title="twilight"><img alt="twilight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/twilight">twilight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424507/#Comment_424507" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T14:56:28+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  2:56PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't give distances in feet; instead, I offer measurements by "average human strides" or "average human lengths" and the like.

This is of course immensely useful for a game like D&amp;D that relies on fictional positioning.<br/><br/>The Finnish doesn't translate exactly, but we regularly speak of rooms being X by Y feet in size (from the viewpoint of the observer at one door or another, with width before depth), with regular or irregular features, possibly shaped like e.g. an oval or triangle instead of the regular square, with shaved corners (two 45 degree turns at the corners instead of sharp 90 degree turns, a typical dungeon feature), alcoves (protruding elements of rooms) or protruding walls. Orientation in the room is described in terms of "near wall", "far wall" and left and right; when observing from a doorway a room "opens left" or right or both depending on where the door is on the near wall. This short list of terminology already covers 90% of the mapping situations, especially when you combine them.<br/><br/>As an example of how this works, an L-shaped room you enter from the end of the long part might initially be described as " a 20 feet wide, 60 feet deep room that has a 20 feet wide alcove opening on the right hand side at the far wall; there are no other entrances". When you enter the room and explore the other end, you find that "the alcove proves to be 30 feet deep, and there is a door at the far end near the left-hand wall".<br/><br/>There are different terminologies out there, and we could talk about the details and best practices (e.g. I strongly suggest using relative terminology instead of objective directions in descriptions, for a variety of reasons), but ultimately it's nothing that you can't develop with a bit of practice yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424510/#Comment_424510" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T15:19:36+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  3:19PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like Eero's suggestion (<i>strong</i> suggestion!) of using description relative to the character instead of objective description. It reminded me of <a href="http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp41.Point.of.View.html" rel="nofollow">a valuable essay Terry Rossio wrote about Point of View</a>, which includes this:\n<blockquote>The important thing, to my ears, was the notion that Robert Zemeckis thought point of view was such a crucial issue. "Oh, yeah," they said. "Bob won't even allow an establishing shot in one of his movies. He'll ask the question -- who's seeing it from that spot? Who's point of view are we showing?"<br/>As many of you know, I consider it my job to roam the halls of Hollywood with my ears open, determined to not miss little tidbits like this.<br/>The concept blazed through my mind. Robert Zemeckis... won't shoot an establishing shot. The venerable establishing shot... how many times have you or I blithely dropped in one of those... and Robert Zemeckis wouldn't shoot it.</blockquote>\nThe idea is when writing a script you want to be telling the tale from the <i>experience</i> of someone in the story. What the character is seeing, what the character is hearing -- limiting the description in the script to the what a given character in a story can see or hear. I'm pretty sure this is a valuable exercise for a GM to use in any game. But I think it's especially important for the kind of play we're specifically talking about here. The sense of limited information <i>but wanting more</i> is so much a part of dungeon crawl play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JustinA" title="JustinA"><img alt="JustinA" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JustinA">JustinA</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424535/#Comment_424535" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T23:02:04+00:00" title="November 20, 2013 11:02PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm echoing some of what other people have already said, but it breaks down fairly simply at my table:<br/><br/>(a) As the GM, I describe what the characters are seeing.<br/>(b) The players map (or choose not to map) to whatever degree of fidelity they see fit.<br/>(c) I will correct their map only if they're making an egregious error which would be trivially obvious to someone actually seeing the room in question.<br/><br/>In general, this method works just fine. It does not result in precise maps. (Although clever mappers can often adjust their maps over time based on multiple error-checks to make them more accurate.) That's OK, though, because precise mapping takes time. This is specifically called out in the OD&amp;D rulebooks and this cost in time is significant in the default dungeon structure because time is a cost that is paid in wandering monster checks.<br/><br/>If you break apart the guidelines given in the original 1974 rulebooks, there are at least three distinct methods of movement through the dungeon:<br/><br/>(1) Fast movement / flight / pursuit. In this method no mapping is allowed.<br/>(2) Normal movement (which proceeds at the default movement rate). Mapping is allowed following a procedure as detailed above.<br/>(3) Searching/listening/ESPing (which also allows for precise measurements and, thus, precise mapping). This takes significantly more time (varying depending on the size of the chamber).<br/><br/>(There's also combat, which may or may not involve movement even faster than fast movement, depending on how you interpret the rulebook. And the third category above could actually be broken down into several sub-categories, although the final adjudication is actually left explicitly to the DM.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424555/#Comment_424555" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T08:46:07+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  8:46AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2013 8:46AM by E.T.Smith.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my favorite recent gaming momets was because of mapping. I was running <i>Swords &amp; Wizardry</i> and the party ran into some wandering goblins. The fight turned against them quickly, some adventurers dropped, the rest fled down the nearest large corridor until they found a chamber with a door to hide behind. Just as they calmed down and started to look over the map, I reached over and pulled it away. I pointed out their mapper was one of the bodies left behind, and that they hadn't specified what direction they fled. The look of real panic dawning in the players' eyes was delicous.<br/><br/><br/>If you're playing OSR games according to the classic challenge-based mode, mapping is a crucial activity. Play is aout exploration, discovering new information about the environment, and the map is the clearest expression of that. In a playstyle where the Dungeon is more a source of continuity than the characters, its arguable the evolving dungeon map is more important than any character record.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424556/#Comment_424556" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T09:37:13+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  9:37AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember running a game for players where I defined a Fae castle with seven rooms.

I couldn't reply sooner because it's been night time then work time here in France, but I've read all your posts so far and there's a lot of really good things in them. I think I have a better view of some procedures I could use without feeling too much constrainted.<br/><br/>I'm not opposed to the precise feet description you talk about, Aviatrix, but it seems to rule out all the caverns or roughly drawn maps (\xe0 la Tony Dowler or some Dyson Logos maps) that I like so much in favor of the classical everything-fits-on-graph-paper map. I wonder how to combine the old school approach with this kind of maps.<br/><br/>Eero description of how to describe according to the PCs situation and positioning, quoted by Christopher, is right in my park. What I specially like also is JustinA's method :\n<blockquote><br/>(a) As the GM, I describe what the characters are seeing.<br/>(b) The players map (or choose not to map) to whatever degree of fidelity they see fit.<br/>(c) I will correct their map only if they're making an egregious error which would be trivially obvious to someone actually seeing the room in question.<br/></blockquote>\nI combines well with Christopher's suggestion :\n<blockquote><br/>And to loop back to Clinton's point: In an OSR, if the Players suspect their map is a bit off (let's say they suspect a secret room is adjacent to the room they're in, but want to confirm it, because the map suggests there is no room), they can certainly say, "We're going to spend some more time here really being precise." Then, in OSR style, the GM makes a ruling: Maybe if they put in another half-hour in game time they get the measurements corrected. Or they roll a d6 and every 10 minutes added to their work increases the odds by one pip. Auto-success for an hour of work. (I like that one.) That's how yo roll in OSR. Not ever situation is presented in the rules. But the Players say, "We want to try this to this effect," and the GM decides if it is at all possible, and if it is comes up with a ruling to see if it works.<br/></blockquote>\nIt seems to permit true to life descriptions and approximate mapping to the best of the players' skills with some referee corrections later if the PCs take the time to check and measure. I think I can dig that.<br/><br/>Eero, I would be very interested in your details and best practices of "vocabulary, grammar and syntax of space description" , if you accept to share them here.<br/><br/>I was also wondering how all those techniques would translate to wilderness adventures and mapping. How do you communicate the space outside of the dungeon so that the players can map it. Do you simply describe the environment around the PCs and fill the blank hexes on the players map, for example ?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424583/#Comment_424583" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T15:00:18+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  3:00PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Eero, I would be very interested in your details and best practices of "vocabulary, grammar and syntax of space description" , if you accept to share them here.</blockquote>\nEh, we mostly play in Finnish (would be exclusively if Jim Raggi didn't come play with us now and then) - not very useful for anybody here to know how exactly we express it linguistically when a pit has a tunnel continuing at the bottom in a parallel direction to the original hallway. It is sufficient to say that once you play enough, you'll develop a special shared understanding about what an "alcove" or "gallery" or "sharp incline" or "bend with a 20 feet turning radius" or "T-junction" or whatever means, and then the GM can easily and effortlessly use those terms with approximate real measurements to give the players an exact understanding of even complex architecture.\n<blockquote>I'm not opposed to the precise feet description you talk about, Aviatrix, but it seems to rule out all the caverns or roughly drawn maps (\xe0 la Tony Dowler or some Dyson Logos maps) that I like so much in favor of the classical everything-fits-on-graph-paper map. I wonder how to combine the old school approach with this kind of maps.</blockquote>\nThere is definitely, certainly no conflict here; the types of caverns you mean, called "Irregular" or "natural" in our local lexicon (as opposed to "regular" or "constructed" architecture that suspiciously - or rather, ironically - conforms to graph paper), are mapped just like anything else. Of course the players will not get exact shape unless their characters really care enough to spend literally hours spelunking in some individual dark cave and measuring all the nooks and crannies.<br/><br/>There are two basic procedures I use for irregular caverns: one is that I tell the players the most conforming basic shape, add the tag "irregular", and provide approximate distance from one wall to the other. For example, a given cavern might be something like this:<br/><br/>"Natural cavern of irregular oval shape, 40 feet long axis, 20 feet short axis, with your entrance midway between the axes. There is a protruding, irregular, round alcove 10 feet deep on the facing wall; it is clearly the nest of the beast you slew just now."<br/><br/>That's entirely possible to draw on graph paper! Of course the players won't get it exactly correct, but that's just realistic - it's much easier to use your measuring stick (surely your adventurers carry one) to measure the width of the regularly built masonry wall than it is for a cave wall that twists and turns subtly and sharply in turn.<br/><br/>The other procedure I use when players state that they desire to spend more time getting the room's shape exactly right. In that case I provide them with a look at the canonical map. If I'm running something off a print-out I'll just cut out the appropriate cavern and hand it to the players, they can copy it or paste it on their map or whatever; if I'm running off a book I don't want to cut, I'll just cover the rest of the map and show the mapper a peek at the appropriate portion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424585/#Comment_424585" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T15:46:11+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  3:46PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2013 3:48PM by ffilz.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the original game, irregular caverns were also suggested as mapping challenges, and actually suggested to be mostly used on lower levels (after the players had a chance to develop some mapping skills). So after coming out the other side of a region of irregular caverns, the PC's map is sure to be off some. And finding a secret room might be very challenging. It might have a really cool treasure, or it might be a place the PCs may just randomly stumble upon (because they happen to look for secret doors in the right place) or the players find because they decide to invest the time to search every tunnel and cavern for secret doors.<br/><br/>I think the key is that if the GM wants to make a mapping puzzle, he has to make his map solvable, even if it's extremely hard.<br/><br/>If you don't want the mapping puzzle to be too difficult, use simple geometry, and if you really want a cavern for color, place the entrances so you can describe the scope of the cavern in simple terms: A roughly round room 50' across with an entrance in the center on the right. Or an irregular cavern filling a 50' wide by 30' deep space. You have entered between the 10' and 20' mark from the left and there is an entrance on the opposite side on the right hand end. The cavern has many nooks and crannies.<br/><br/>I've also been tempted to run a mapping exercise online. I would take a dungeon, and you would explore it as purely a mapping challenge. That would allow me as GM to train myself to describe more clearly and would train you to map, at least from my description.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424595/#Comment_424595" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T01:28:19+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  1:28AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2013 1:29AM by 2097.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, as always, I'm jealous of the Finnish case system.

As far as I understand it, ASL is the best langague for this stuff, unless that's a myth. It's supposed to be very clear for spatial descriptions.<br/><br/><br/>Actually, what we ended up doing in Barrowmaze and ASE (I'm a player, not the DM) is that the DM draws the map. It evolved/degenerated to this.

When I am drawing up dungeons I try to give them their own architectural feelings as well as other direct or indirect thematic elements. Big dungeons get different themes for each level. So sometimes, we have long tunnels and lots of empty space. But other times, the dungeon is mostly rooms crammed up right against one another. In those dungeons, players sometimes start looking for secret doors when they notice a 10\u02b9 space.<br/><br/>But there are lots of lesser elements of the mapping challenge that are more common. In a big dungeon, there are multiple entrances and multiple routes. The map enables these to be connected. Especially as the players begin to develop goals (finding a way through the dungeon to another exit, finding something in particular, finding the quickest way to return to a certain site on the next visit, etc.) they start to explore a big gradient in between the two poles, the map as a puzzle, and the map as a route in and out (not to mention the map as a tactical resource).<br/><br/>Probably my favourite story from my almost two-year weekly game came some number of weeks after a foolish party discovered that the burial mounds on the surface near town contained Wights\u2014the first time they had encountered monsters that didn't quite play by the same rules as them (immune to normal weapons and level drain), making them terrifying. One of the players estimated where the under-mound staircase they found (and fled from) would arrive on the level below. Weeks later, an entirely different party was given the same map, now marked with a warning, and found themselves winding closer and closer to that spot. The results were pretty incredible\u2014tension between the sort-of-leader who had heard the story secondhand and a crowd of new folk with lower stakes and less attachment to their characters, but who also ended up running in fear, and a tragic double-cross. They make the mapping challenges for themselves.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43783145/wight-stairs-1.png"/><br/><br/>Unfortunately the big "wight" warning has long since been erased from this map as it has been fully connected with the rest of the level, and errors fixed. But you can see where several folk fell to beetles right before the confrontation which was where questions started to be asked about the leadership of the magic-user telling them about the undead. From there, they took the long passage north and east, around the stairway complex. Just east of the stairs, at an unlabeled 30\u02b9 room that was filled with bones, their leader Yurang laid down an ultimatum that he would go no closer, and when others insisted, he poured a line of oil across the passage, threatening to light it if he heard anything untoward. Three others nonetheless went forward, but they started to hear something coming down the passage as they found the sarcophagus, and fled\u2014to which Yurang set the oil alight. Two leapt through the flames, one almost dead (he was hailed as "Drozdak the Invicible" from that point until his death two weeks later), but the third doubted his chances and instead decided to set an arrow on the magic-user and let the ghost claim his soul. Both perished.<br/><br/>One of my players maintains these maps in a google drive folder which he will charge other characters for access to in in-game currency.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425820/#Comment_425820" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-15T17:06:38+00:00" title="December 15, 2013  5:06PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wonderful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425824/#Comment_425824" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-15T18:28:09+00:00" title="December 15, 2013  6:28PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never was in a game with a mapping challenge really.

Do we really need to know exact shape of Twenty-first Hall in the Sixth Level, when there is nothing interesting for us there (apart from mummified remains of goblins and dwarfs lying side by side where they fell decades ago)?<br/><br/>I am aware it is not conventional, but I always imagined the Fellowship in Moria, how they go through this vast dungeon and draw a map with all details and measure all corridors and chasms, so their map is really accurate. Well... that idea didn\xb4t really worked for me. <br/><br/>I think that players should only draw things that matter for <i>orientation</i> in dungeon, so they can\xb4t get lost. That\xb4s why maps are drawn, isn\xb4t it? Plus typical problem, how to draw for example real caverns and dungeons that are not regular. We thus only draw a symbolic map of dungeon. Full circle with few notes for a room and lines for a corridors. Most of the time it is enough (for example the crossroads from Moria with three ways would look on our map like a line for incoming corridor, circle for a small room and three outgoing lines for a three corridors leading out of room), for important rooms (like Chamber of Mazarbul) we draw a partial thorough map on a separate sheet of paper. For greater dungeons it works perfectly. It is functional and we don\xb4t spend much time over drawing maps so we can focus on playing itself.

It seems to me that many are interpreting the exact scaled maps as a matter of procedure, which they are not for any version of D&amp;D I know: the procedure is that the players draw their maps, ask their questions, and decide for themselves how they want to map. The actual choice to draw a map to scale is always made on a case-by-case basis by the players, they might just as easily decide to not map at all.<br/><br/>The above implies that I do think that there is something impure about a process of play where the GM is concerned about the mapping issue. "In my dungeons you don't draw scale maps because you don't need them" is something said by a GM who is surpassing his responsibilities and micromanaging the players. I understand it when a GM teaches map-drawing procedure (often the GM is the one who transmits the conventions of play) or negotiates terminology used to describe fictional space with the players (they have to be speaking the same language, after all), but a GM deciding what type of map the players should draw for each dungeon or for their campaign, that doesn't seem to accord with procedure for me.<br/><br/>The reflection of this player responsibility is the GM's responsibility to proffer answers to questions about the fictional space. There is no GM duty to prepare scaled maps of your dungeons (I often don't myself), but there <i>is</i> a duty to answer reasonable questions about fictional spaces, and this implies that you might occasionally have to improvise such if a player asks detailed questions about a space that you drew vaguely in your own notes. If you don't feel comfortable improvising this type of detail, prepare maps with more detail. Sufficient and proper GM notes are whatever you need to fulfill your duties as the GM, there is no officially mandated proper map format.<br/><br/>The reason I'm clarifying the matter in this way is that I don't find it a very exact idea that you have to be mapping in a certain way to be playing "old school". At least the way I play (which might or might not be old school for you - I'm not particularly wedded to the issue) doesn't care a fig of whether the players scratch their maps in cat litter as long as the responsibilities are clear: if the players want to have notes, they have to be the ones creating them, instead of having the GM do it for them. And the quality of your notes is up to you.<br/><br/>(In case it's not clear: the normative turns of phrase in the above are intended to apply to the way I play and understand dungeon crawling like D&amp;D. You of course play however you desire at your own table, no reason to mind what I find "in accordance with procedure" at all.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426193/#Comment_426193" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-22T15:45:18+00:00" title="December 22, 2013  3:45PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2013 3:47PM by Rafu.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion">@Ecthelion</a>, I believe the real truth of the matter is: maps like your example suffice in real life, for people to orient themselves. But in a game of D&amp;D, players only have a map as their main visual cue toward how to visualize the imaginary world around their characters. That is: the practical functions of a map as tool were, since the very beginning, conflated with the desire for a game board in a game which has none. Or one could say that the DM's "master" map <i>is</i> the game board, and since it's more often than not a lovingly crafted thing it's quite a pity that the other players cannot look at it \u2014 thus a desire to have their functional map resemble the master map as closely as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426198/#Comment_426198" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-22T20:17:02+00:00" title="December 22, 2013  8:17PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2013 8:24PM by adamwb.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an artist I find that the players' various attempts to reproduce my maps are one of my favourite parts of the game. I am always surprised by the choices they make, based on contextual clues. Often their maps include considerably more detail than my own (turning a quickly sketched tunnel system on an index card into an isometric 3-d drawing on triangular dot grid, or even just illustrating the furniture in each room).<br/><br/><img alt="3d map" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/5db64d055eff45c67751993b8a0e7ea6/tumblr_muhh6muyqa1sj0ra2o1_r1_1280.png"/><br/><br/>* it later turned out that this was in fact not the dragon's lair at all<br/><br/>But I certainly don't tell them what to include and the different players who do it all use different techniques as they feel are appropriate (although if they ask, I will describe my own techniques roughly). It's most visible in the wilderness maps in our archive which include illustrative hex-by-hex treks and quick sketches of islands with estimated measurements jotted down on each side, and simple line drawings of their route with distances marked. Each map is a choice made between expediency and detail based on what kind of use they expect to make of it in the future.<br/><br/><img alt="wilderness hex map" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/00742176ae750fd7f0e91273f2acb2ac/tumblr_mtsrt2yyq61sj0ra2o1_1280.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="rough wilderness map" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43783145/random%20posts/Niflheim.jpg"/><br/><br/>To be fair they are much less confident mapping in the wilderness and sometimes find it frustrating compared to the dungeon. But that map of Moore Mary was nonetheless very important in them eventually finding Honour Gorge and the dragon that they were looking for there\u2014they only had rough directions and were able to track it down.<br/><br/>When playing with people who play other D&amp;Ds recently I was surprised that when I handed them graph paper and suggested that mapping was something that they might want, one of them jumped right into a map made on 5-foot squares rather than the 10 that I assume to be the default. I guess like a battlemat. It made me think for a moment, a tiny detail but meaningful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
