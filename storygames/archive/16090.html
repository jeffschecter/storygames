How do I explain to her that this is not creepy, it is innocent fun about innocent kids growing up, and that it is all in good fun, and that you are not your character, etc?

On the other hand, part of what's exciting about roleplaying in general is getting to step outside of your skin and imagine the world from new points of view. And with teenagers specifically, part of what's cool is how close to the surface the drama is. Teenagers are both irrational and forthright in ways that adults aren't, which can make for really interesting and engaging stories. So yeah, I guess it's weird, but it's also really cool."<br/><br/>Then shrug emphatically, drop the subject, and go back to dicing onions (or whatever it is that you were just doing).<br/><br/>Wait a day, or three, or five. This'll give the notion time to sink in, and your girlfriend can engage it in her mind without you trying to drill your opinion into her brain. Maybe she'll decide that the cool outweighs the weird, but maybe she won't. Say your piece, give her time, allow her to come to her own conclusions. That's the fair and respectful thing to do.<br/><br/>Then, after 1/3/5 days, you can say, "So, I know you said GxB sounded weird. But I was wondering if you wanted to try it out. Are you into it?"<br/><br/>If she likes the idea of a roleplaying game where people go on three dates, but doesn't like the teen aspect, then <b>Breaking the Ice</b> might work for her.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366647/#Comment_366647" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T17:36:07+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  5:36PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

The best way might be to explain starting from something she does understand and is comfortable with, and even maybe has experience with, like acting. Try to talk honestly and and candidly about your motivations when you roleplay, but also shy away from the idea of "being another person" and words like "fantasy" or "immersion" as these are likely to be misconstrued. Instead try to frame it in familiar terms using activities she does see as normal (again, like acting, on a stage or on screen) as examples and metaphors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366715/#Comment_366715" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T01:40:21+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  1:40AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 1:41AM by biggles.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Why is GxB not weird for adults to play?</div>\n</blockquote>\nI don't know what that is but sounds like it is weird for adults to like it. Kind of like roleplaying games in general. It's a roleplaying game, right? Some people can be quite judgmental about the whole thing. It's okay to be weird though. Sometimes others will accept the weirdness or even join in and sometimes they won't. Such is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for teenagers, a lot of people watch television programs like Glee, which is largely about teenagers and their relationship drama.  So liking media about teenagers is not abnormal for adult Americans. It is expected behaviour. Transformers is also about teens (and robots) and my dad thinks it's a very exciting film. He's not an American but he is mostly normal. There is, I suppose, a possibility that she has misinterpreted the goals of the game and believes that you have a cheerleader-centric or teen-centric sexual fetish of some sort. I think a lot of people have a fetish for teen-centric media but in most cases it's not sexual at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I looked it up. The other thing is that the artwork is based around high-school anime, which has a many and varied politics. So this one deals with the Japanese fetishisation of teen romance, as opposed to the american, which many americans consider weird. Even though their own is kosher. High school anime often portray their central characters as painfully simplistic individuals with strong and definite personality traits. So if someone asked me if I wanted to play this game, that's what I would think I was in for. I would definitely not expect any of the stuff in Joe's post because it's not generally present in high school anime. Maybe your girlfriend is concerned that you feel that your relationship would be more interesting if viewed through the lens of high school anime romance? There's a billion ways ways to misinterpret any given thing that's perceived to be &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm, of course, probably not being helpful. For one, teen media isn't really my thing unless the central characters are filthy miscreants up to no good, and for another I usually deal with people thinking something I like is weird by being an alienating prick until they drop the subject. The first means I'm kind of unqualified although I can certainly offer lots of perspective on why people might not like a teeny game, the second means anything I say is most likely bad advice for dealing with nice ordinary people. edit: the most sound advice is in jackson's post i think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366776/#Comment_366776" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T09:02:14+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  9:02AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 9:02AM by Hans_c-o.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: biggles</cite>The other thing is that the artwork is based around high-school anime, which has a many and varied politics.</blockquote>\nYeah, maybe it's the style that's making things weird for her?

Right now you are at an age where you are transitioning from the college age time where you hang out with friends a lot into the "settled" time, where you are your friends all start settling down and marrying and buying houses and developing careers and having kids and all that stuff. <br><br>Right around the corner is coming a period of time where your leisure activities will go from being relatively abundant to being much more narrow and focused. When you have kids, liesure activities become nearly nonexistant for the first 2-3 years. And you should put some serious thought into how this relationship is going to impact what gets whittled out of your social calendar. How much do you want roleplaying to be a part of your life 10 years from now, and how is this relationship going to affect that?<br><br>I hope this doesn't come off as unwarrentedly personal. I don't know you well and I don't know your girlfriend. I only know what I'm reading in this thread, and I know that I've seen your name on this forum quite often, from which I gauge your interest in rpgs to be significant. So I know I may well be out of line by recommending that you but serious thought into evaluating your relationship. If I offend, I apologize.<br><br>I'm 38 with a wife who doesn't really get roleplaying. She has tried it a handful of time over the past 20 years that we've been together, but she always feels self-conscious about it - always feels like she's somehow doing it wrong (which is ironic, because she's actually quite good at it whenever she stops second guessing herself or tuning out). But key is the fact that she's never been opposed to me participating - as long as it doesn't involve me spending too much time away from her and my son. Because of that, I've never been able to participate in a long term regular campaign meeting on a regular basis - much of my RP time comes at the local conventions that I attend pretty regularly 3 weekends a year. And now that my son is old enough to play, we spent last year hosting a lightweight biweekly game at our house that she participated in, though some evenings she would bow out and do things like dishes or work on grading (she's a teacher). <br><br>In being in a relationship with her, I needed to accept that it would have a significant impact on my gaming life, which is important because it's an area that I'm passionate about. I get to do some things, but not everything I might want to. My wife is mostly supportive of my interests, though she considers them to be low on the scale of important things - lower than I would place them myself - which occasionally leads to some conflict and discussion.<br/><br/>Here's the thing - if she was any more opposed to my gaming interests than she currently is, I don't know if it would work.<br/><br/>But that's me. You know yourself best.<br/><br/>I'm just trying to give you something to think about. It's certainly not for me to tell you what to do, other than to encourage you to consider your options carefully and to be prepared to accept the results of your choices.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366826/#Comment_366826" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T11:11:41+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:11AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 11:15AM by jdfristrom.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll argue a little bit for the prosecution just because nobody else is:<br/><br/>I'm married and have played GxB and thought it was harmless but I did sort of 'throw' the game - I purposely played a guy I thought the girl would never go for. If a guy was playing the girl I might have played harder to 'win' because at some level I feel like I'm a little infidelious (made up word but you know what I mean) - which is maybe weird?  When my character cuts your character's head off in a game I'm completely separated from it, it doesn't occur to anyone that I really want to attack you IRL, but with romance there's more bleed I guess. (This could happen in real life! Will she (the player) think I (the player) am really into her? What would my wife think?)<br/><br/>Also, I've heard stories about married men who have girlfriends (or even wives?) in Second Life, and I don't understand why their real-life wives put up with it. I won't call it creepy - it might even be natural - hey, who wouldn't want a fantasy mistress - but if my wife had some fantasy husband/lover on the side in some MUD or something I would freak out. <br/><br/>GxB isn't that, but it is a tiny baby step in that direction. <br/><br/>So for me I have this continuum: Adultery - wrong. A long term pretend adulterous relationship - wrong. Doing a kissing scene in a play - not sure, probably wrong (those Hollywood marriages don't last too long, do they?). One session of pretend dating - okay. But maybe your girlfriend draws the line at a different place than I do. Maybe she's not so much creeped out as in she thinks you're creepy - because, yeah, that wouldn't be cool - but creeped out because you're her guy and you shouldn't be looking elsewhere, even pretend? (In which case maybe you should be a little flattered that she's jealous.)<br/><br/>And, in which case (after a cooling off period) maybe you could narrow it down. "Is it because you're a little jealous? What if I play the girl? Would that still bother you? What if a guy plays the girl? Would that still bother you? What if it's a girl player, but she plays the guy and I play the girl?" <br/><br/><br/>My wife doesn't get my roleplaying either, fwiw.  When I come home from a game night and tell her, "I was a widow who seduced a samurai so he'd save our village!" she'll say something like "In your head?" but she's never begrudged me for the (usually homosexual) seduction stuff that goes on in my games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366835/#Comment_366835" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T11:24:12+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><br/>Also, I've heard stories about married men who have girlfriends (or even wives?) in Second Life, and I don't understand why their real-life wives put up with it.

An old friend of mine recognized that kink was important to him, that it wasn't desirable to his wife, and they sat down and negotiated sex-centric Second Life play as something that would meet everyone's needs and leave everyone feeling secure about their involvement in the relationship. (For others, I'm sure it's decidedly less healthy and negotiated).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366844/#Comment_366844" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T11:45:27+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:45AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My gf and I are just starting to talk more thoroughly about what happens in the games I play. She's not really interested in tabletop gaming, mostly because the idea of "being on the spot" and having to make up stuff is anxiety-inducing for her, but she's played Castle Ravenloft, listened in to a bit of our Freemarket game (including a part about implanting false memories of sexual encounters), and has some sense about what it is that I do on "game nights." She's only the second person I've dated that had any sense of what my hobby life is like and has, for the most part, been really supportive.<br/><br/>One thing that's helped, I think, is comparing the squickier games I've played to media that she likes (or both of us like).  Frex, I describe Monsterhearts as the "<i>Being Human/Twilight</i> game," which makes all the monster-on-monster romance seem appropriate and less creepy.  GxB may be harder if she's not really into anything that's in that vein (like Andy says: anime, dating sim video games, etc.). That's cool.  I mean, I honestly think a lot of that stuff is pretty squicky too (elementary-school dating sims, anyone? yeah). Nobody should necessarily get a pass or unconditional support, right? There's a lot of things that are really creepy and problematic! So just do you best to explain it or let it drop and -- if it continues to be an issue -- deal with it then, make a compromise, or come to some other solution. That's the best you can do, really. Decide to what extent these things are important to you (playing GxB, having your gf's support, etc.) and do what makes sense.

Totally not getting where she's coming from here.</blockquote>\nShe's coming from a different play space than you. That's a term from drama therapy* that means what is okay to play with. There are things you are okay with playing with (not just games: jokes, stories, inuendo, friendly comments, not-so friendly comments, acting, etc).  <br/><br/>She's not only doesn't want to play with it, but she's not okay with you wanting to play it.  She may have very good reasons for that (or most importantly, reasons you believe are good and worth protecting), reasoning that could use reevaluation, or she may have never really thought about it. Since you emphasized that you hoped you "finally" found a game she would enjoy, I'm wondering if she's had a problem with other games as well, or if this just crossed a particular line.<br/><br/>The most important thing about a relationship isn't enjoying all of each others interests. However, it's critical that you enjoy each other enjoying your interests. But instead she's uncomfortable - not just with you playing it (which is a red flag that needs resolution) but with you wanting to play it. Which means she has a problem with what you're interested in, which means she has a problem with you.  It may be minor, it may in fact be nothing with her (maybe she was joking in a way that's outside of your play space, so you interpreted it as a problem - this is just as likely), but it's something that is about something bigger than just this game.  It's probably worth a discussion.<br/><br/>The main sign of potential in a relationship comes down to that. Do both people care enough about each other to expand their personal play space to account for the idiosyncrasies and quirks and weirdness of the other? Maybe she does, but she doesn't know how (or even know that it's possible - "normal is normal!"). <br/><br/>It's not "weird" to play GxB, or any other consensual moral activity (it's unusual, but RPGs in general are niche and unusual). It's up to you to figure out why it's become weird in your relationship and whether that's worth resolving by working out the disagreement on what's "okay to play" or by moving on and out of a relationship that might be attempting to modify and restrict your play space, instead of allowing you to expand it.<br/><br/>*Just to be clear, I'm not a therapist nor trying to be, just using some helpful technology I'm familiar with because I know several drama therapists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366909/#Comment_366909" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T13:48:02+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  1:48PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I originally got it because I liked the JedixSith add-on and wanted to be able to play that, but after reading it and hearing someone's podcast on having a lot of fun with it and his high-school age gaming club, I, while not necessarily super-interested in the game, certainly didn't see anything wrong with saying that it was a game I would play.

You aren't going to convince her (at least not through short term argumentation) that it's an ok thing. <br/><br/>The idea of an adult wanting to play out underage romance themes is not acceptable to her - I assume it comes to close to being a form of potential virtual statutory rape. Which, presumably, is a hot button of some sort for her.<br/><br/>So now Joseph knows that and has accepted it. If, in the future, he wants to loosen her expectations up a bit, he might want to venture to get her to a stage where she doesn't mind if he plays a game like that, as long as she isn't involved. Which may or may not ever happen. Or it may not be important enough to Joseph to establish that as acceptable.<br/><br/>In the mean time, you may want to attempt to engage her in something relatively lightweight but without the orky fantasy overtones that she's expressed a lack of interest in. Maybe something like pulp adventure or Dresden Files or non-fantasy detective stories or something else she's interested in. Best of luck.

She was a mouse called Quentin and I GM'd. But when I brought it up, she claimed to have only thought it was at all fun because I seemed to be enjoying it. And that she thought the pictures of mice in the book were cute.</blockquote>\nThat's a good sign that she had enough of an empathic connection to enjoy a game with you even though she, in retrospect, realized she didn't enjoy playing the game itself.<br/><br/>The key point isn't to find what game she will tolerate or be okay with, but to ask yourself how much effort this relationship is worth (it might be a lot!) and then discuss with her what value you get out of gaming. Forget trying to find a game that she'll enjoy. And forget trying to find things that only exist within her comfort zone. Instead, focus on your experience, what you get out of gaming, and let her know that it's really important that she be supportive of your interests, even if she would find it uncomfortable if she were to play.<br/><br/>I don't think someone needs to understand all your interests to be close to you, but they should be supportive and trust that even though it might be outside their comfort zone, you're not doing anything they consider to be skirting a moral line (which is the judgment I get from "creepy"). She is perhaps completely justified, perhaps having concerns that play would naturally tend to be puerile and sexist. Or maybe she has other concerns. Whatever they are, she feels they are completely justified.  And it's likely that it stems mostly from not really knowing how the games play out, and not understanding that you might be aware of her concerns and have them yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16090/why-is-gxb-not-weird-for-adults-to-play" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16090/why-is-gxb-not-weird-for-adults-to-play" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16090/why-is-gxb-not-weird-for-adults-to-play/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16090%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16090%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
