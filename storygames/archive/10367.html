I know about Kumoricon in particular, because the gaming leads hunted me down as well as a bunch of others who produced anime-style RPGs. Jake Richmond ended up going and running Maid as well as his anime-themed games (presumably Panty Explosion, Land of Yeld, etc). In his words, "The response was enormous. If you brought a few dozen copies of your game, you would have sold out by the end of the con, absolutely."<br/><br/>This is something I've been thinking about for years, but recent movement at local anime cons solidified it: If you have an anime-themed gaming product, and make your target market the existing roleplaying community, rather than the much larger anime community, you're doing yourself a disservice.<br/><br/>Anime cons are usually filled with people who love the medium and are looking for something new. They're also looking for <i>something to do</i>, which isn't something most anime cons have: You can go to the dealer's hall to look at manga you already have and videos you already watched (at store prices); the big sellers are ones that produce interesting goods you can't normally find in stores. You can go to the anime viewing rooms to watch anime you already have seen. You can go to con panels to watch people talk about what they feel when they do the voice-overs for Panty Princess. You can meet your online friends. You can watch the cosplayers. That's about it. Just observing, not doing.<br/><br/>The events that feature *actual things to do* tend to get extremely popular and nuts: Karaoke, Guitar Hero/DDR, Video Games, etc. Tabletop RPGs tend to fall into this category as well: The anime cons that feature a TRPG area tend to overflow with anime gamers, or more importantly anime fans who are also interested in gamers.<br/><br/>From a merchant standpoint, that's a huuuuuuge target market, far more a target than aiming to run anime-themed games at a general gaming con (especially one that appears to be 90% electonic/console-focused). From a social point of view, again if you have an anime-themed game, anime cons will be a far more receptive audience.<br/><br/>If you're trying to run Sorcerer or carry or Burning Wheel or Polaris or whatever, then yeah probably an event like PAX would be good for that sort of thing (if they don't run out of tickets before the event, yikes). But if you're trying to run Panty Explosion, Exalted, Bliss Stage, Maid or other anime-themed games, it would be ridiculous to not consider existing anime fans as a rich pool of interest in your product (and I don't mean just a "potential sales mark", but rather a huge - HUGE - community that is potentially more interested in your game than the fewer folks interested in playing anime-themed games in a general gaming convention.<br/><br/>It would be like passing up a small RPG con in the next town over (given the percentage of folks interested in tabletop vs console) in order to run Mouse Guard at Comicon. But then being asked why you're elitist for not going to the "gamer con" instead.<br/><br/>So how is aiming at a target market/community elitist now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230513/#Comment_230513" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T06:55:12+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  6:55AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because I'd rather shoot myself in the head (with a paintball gun at least) than game at a con. <br/><br/>Which elitist arrogance is not typical of our sect, most of whom are con whores.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230524/#Comment_230524" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T07:23:52+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  7:23AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're gonna try to go to PAX Boston this coming March and bring the Story Game goodness.

PAX is a smaller, cooler, more modern Gen Con right in your backyard. As a group, we freak the fuck out over Gen Con. We spend months organizing and spend thousands upon thousands of dollars to ensure that we make a tiny splash in that giant pond. <br/><br/>Given the very small presence of RPGs at the show, the simple commitment to show up to PAX, grab a free table and run games would make a huge impact. It's hugely fertile ground. A panel about indie RPGs drew over 100 people this year. Can you imagine drawing 100 people to a panel at Gen Con?! We're lucky if we get 30.<br/><br/>Yet, in three years of attending the show, I've seen very little interest from the rather large, active, SG Northwest contingent. I'm just curious why that is. If it's because we're ignorant elitists, I think that kind of sucks. <br/><br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230530/#Comment_230530" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T07:40:22+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  7:40AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>We're gonna try to go to PAX Boston this coming March and bring the Story Game goodness.

I went to PAX this year specifically to scout it out as an alternative to Gen Con. I only spent a few hours this year because I can't spend much money and time on an unproven convention. What I saw made me very happy.<br/><br/>The Good: <br/>Even though the convention floor was stuffed with video games, off the floor I saw board games and RPGs happening everywhere.<br/>Luke's Beyond D&amp;D session attracted a large crowd (sorry I had to leave early)<br/>The Dreaming game store booth looked plenty busy and was full of indie RPGs. <br/>At PAX the convention floor space and the social space are much more closely integrated than at Gen Con, and there's a more generally people-friendly feeling to the spaces outside of the exhibit hall, included places for informal socializing and resting.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>The convention floor is ridiculously loud. I had to scream to talk to the guy demo-ing his game for me because the next booth over had a full sound stage set up with the volume cranked to 11. WTF?<br/>It's not particularly kid friendly.<br/>It's a crowded con and the convention hall is dark and maze-like.<br/><br/>I wouldn't sell PAX as a replacement for Gen Con. It's its own thing again, and in some ways potentially better than Gen Con. With the exhibit hall and play spaces being so close together, it would be incredibly easy to have a booth selling games in conjunction with a room where you could go play them. In fact, I think that's more or less what the Dreaming folks were doing already.

It was a Q&amp;A, so I asked if there was any chance of them podcasting sessions of something besides D&amp;D. They said 'yeah, sure' and magnanimously took John's portfolio. Someone else had given them some other indie games (Steal Away Jordan and something else) and they were pretty interested in the indie scene. Tycho specifically name dropped Mouse Guard, and said that's something they may podcast sessions of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230633/#Comment_230633" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T13:25:39+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  1:25PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was too busy playing games to run any. <br/><br/>I had planned to run some Lacuna, but I ended up having to leave before I got my chance due to some family issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230635/#Comment_230635" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T13:29:16+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  1:29PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint&amp;Sinner</cite>Because I was at Dragoncon helping the first indie game panels get off the ground, organizing their first Games on Demand, and running Mouse Guard, Houses of the Blooded, and Amber Diceless.

Or else he'll come find you.</blockquote>\nIn case this happens, keep in mind that Luke Crane is heavily invested into a laser vision attack (see Figure 1), resulting in something of a one-trick-pony. Most of his other stats have been designated 'dump stats' to compensate (see Monstrous Compendium entry). Thus, if you can defeat this trick, the battle should be decisively in your favor. A mirror will serve you well in this endeavor. Ablative armor is a less cost-effective solution, though it does protect you even when unawares. By its nature, the laser vision attack requires Luke Crane to be looking at you, so a surprise attack from the rear will bypass his primary attack entirely.<br/><br/>If a wild Luke Crane appears as part of a random encounter, you may not be well-prepared to deal with his primary attack. In this case, noting that his 'belligerence' score is listed as 'high,' you are well-advised to act promptly. Again, a successful surprise attack has a strong chance to win you the encounter outright. If the situation demands retreat, remember to obtain cover as quickly as possible. Maintaining cover should be a higher priority than the hastening of your retreat. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.agon-rpg.com/photos/luke_kills_with_a_stare_low.jpg"/><br/>Figure 1: Luke Crane employs his laser vision.

Anime cons are at least as much of a fertile untapped market as PAX, and one I'm specifically looking into for some of my future projects (as well as indie RPGs in general), especially since there are not a few anime cons that aren't 1,000 miles away from me (and one that's literally within walking distance).<br/><br/>If people weren't running stuff at PAX as much as they could be, I'd chalk it up to ignorance, and wouldn't even consider bringing "elitism" into the conversation.

Personally, I'm kinda sick of GenCon's bullshit: People do take it as The Only Con Worth Going To, and even plan to have their game ready and released for GenCon ("The Great Trap"; hey, I got caught in it too!) as if it was some kind of milestone that mattered. It's too big, it's too noisy, and it's more of a market than a playspace for what I want out of it (I could also throw down 40 hours of sessions with strangers as well, but that kinda gets tiring after a while, too). I realized after Origins this year that I mainly go to GenCon anyway to:<br/>* Meet my online friends. Online friendships have turned into real friendships through GenCon, so this is a big reason for me.<br/>* Check out new shit that just came out, and yeah, buy some stuff.<br/>* Play some games, preferably with a few of such friends.<br/>* Pimp my shit, when I've got shit to pimp.<br/>* Get sucked into the enthusiastic atmosphere. For all I say about the bullshit of people treating it like it's the only thing worth going to, once you're there the enthusiasm is overwhelming and infectious, and Good.<br/><br/>I go to events like local cons for the reasons above minus the one about "buy stuff". I go to events like Camp Nerdly (the equivalent of the Go Play NW) because it has Atmosphere and Friends in quantities so high that no other environment even comes close. GenCon is also in Indianapolis, a town of which I can only ever find like 3 places I'd ever want to eat.<br/><br/>So, it's obvious that PAX hasn't really been on anyone's radar, especially not mine. Here's pretty much why:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>Up until Luke posted about it, I'd heard next to nothing about tabletop gaming at PAX.</blockquote>\nSee, I know about PAX: I'm a huge PS2/PS3 fan. I post on the kotaku.com comments, participate at gamerswithjobs.com, and hit penny-arcade every Mon, Wed and Fri. If I were into huge console promotional events like E3 (like E3 WAS, that is), I'd totally be interested in going to PAX; flying out, or travelling there if I was more local. Thing is, all that I every heard about it, even from Quintin Stone (Quintin is in my gaming group and goes yearly with his wife: His wife's family lives in Seattle, so they visit family for the week and he uses PAX as a capstone; he apparently wanted to come to Luke's panel but missed it because he was rocking out at the live band events until like 3AM or something and felt like shit), had been that it's like a console gaming 3-ring-circus: It has demos, it has displays, it has gaming events, it has celebrities, it has noise, it has musical events and guests like various Nerdcore musicians, etc. But I've never heard much about the tabletop area/aspect.<br/><br/>And I remember Luke and others reporting about PAX last year, but all I really heard was "there was some people playing D&amp;D, and some indie dudes crashed a game design panel, or ran a discussion, or something". Nothing was really said at all about what was played, what the scene looked like, and so on. <br/><br/>Who knows, with a little more organization and more guest tickets available in future years, it might be a great replacement for GenCon SoCal, a "huge gaming event on the Left Coast".<br/><br/>Sooooo, I guess from my standpoint, all that's left now is to tell us about the event. In detail. What did you play. What did you see. What were the people like. Who ran some games, and what was their feedback. How was tabletop gaming big there, and not just something that fit in between the cracks of this console gaming circus. And so on.<br/><br/>If it's that good, I'd give up GenCon in a heartbeat to run and play stuff at PAX in Seattle. <i>But I'd need to know more from the people who went there</i> (ah, see what I did there? Impetus is now back on y'all, see? :-) ) to convince me and others that it's worth weaning ourselves off of the GenCon Teat to check out.<br/><br/>Also, I've never been to Seattle, but I blew it up once in a game of With Great Power. So I'd totally be up for seeing the places in Google Maps with my own eyes that I destroyed with magic and fire.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230704/#Comment_230704" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T20:39:10+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  8:39PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread was really intended more for the SG NW contingent than SG at large.

Or something similar. <br/><br/>I find the attitude that "I didn't know there was anything but computer games" odd. We have a history of wedging ourselves into other local cons that are full of freaks who don't play our games. Why not this one? They're gamers, just like us. PAX attendies have varied and broad tastes, just like us. They have favorite games and other stuff that they dabble in, just like us.

attitude that "I didn't know there was anything but computer games" odd. We have a history of wedging ourselves into other local cons that are full of freaks who don't play our games. Why not this one? They're gamers, just like us. PAX attendies have varied and broad tastes, just like us. They have favorite games and other stuff that they dabble in, just like us. And those tastes include RPGs, console games, comics, panels, music and nerding out with your friends.</blockquote>\nOkay, so is this what the thread is really about? Because unlike some of the other stuff in the thread, it makes sense. Where there are nerds, there are people who are into RPGs (or who might like RPGs if they tried them), so we should try harder to seek those people out. I can get behind that a lot more readily than "Why the fuck weren't you there with games in hand? Are you some kind of ignorant elitists?" Let's talk about how the NW folks can make PAX even more awesome in 2010, and what other events are that fertile for the rest of us. You know, something actually constructive.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite><b>As for Ben's response,</b>I found it rather pithy, uninformative and snobbish. Perhaps I misread it, but in absence of an expansion from the author, I think I my opinion will remain as is.</blockquote>\nYeah, Ben could stand to be more verbose, as usual, but taking into account the added context that Andy gave, it's pretty clear that you did indeed misread it. Kumoricon represents a better, more targeted audience for Bliss Stage (and Panty Explosion, Maid RPG, etc.) than PAX. Ben and Jake were doing exactly what you've been advocating, at an anime con. And that's <i>awesome</i>.<br/><br/><i>Edit to Add:</i> Check out <a href="http://swingpad.com/dustyboots/wordpress/?p=258" rel="nofollow">Ben's new blog post on how things went</a>.

I think story games are a fun, relatively unknown pass time that I want more people to know about. It's also a little self-serving: more gamers means more cool people to play with, and more people making cool games for me to play.<br/><br/>I'd guess most people are driven by more or less the same things: they want so share cool stuff with people.

I'm having a lot of trouble reading you generously here. I feel antagonized, and I've watched you tear down what others have said.<br/>That's important to note.<br/><br/>2.) You're right that PAX is a better return on investment (of time, energy and money) than Gencon. You`re also right that more NW folk should have been there (I foolishly blew my budget on Gencon instead).<br/><br/>3.) The way you treat people in these threads (point 1) eclipses the fact that you are right (point 2) for me. I`m left wanting to avoid PAX in order to avoid you. Which might sound like an attack, but it`s more meant to communicate: I feel myself getting defensive and upset reading your posts.<br/><br/>I just wanted to share that viewpoint.<br/>It was most aggravated by the line ``Do you think your elitist ignorance is typical of our sect?``<br/><br/>Which... did you know what game and con he was talking about? (anime game / anime con)<br/>If not, you could have asked. Or, like, ignored.<br/>And if you did understand that he was talking about an anime game and an anime con... and you still thought PAX was a better fit... you could have explained yourself, because that's an interesting viewpoint and I'd love to hear that explained.<br/><br/>Basically, Ben wasn't being a great communicator either... but you alienated me and lots of others, and I've experienced that over and over again lately.<br/>I feel like you're tearing down community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Impacts:<br/>-- Every other local con I GM, so I need My One True Con every year as a way to really relax and be carefree 9and get properly hammered, which I avoid when GMing).<br/>-- If I had a product to push, I'd probably take it there (and will, with GLASS, as they have a very large LARP contingent--how's that at PAX, if I may ask?).<br/><br/>* PAX is in Seattle. I am in North Carolina. Impacts:<br/>-- Individual airfare instead of splitting gas with my friend who goes with me nearly every year.<br/>-- Hotel charges (and possibly transportation, if they sell out like at D*C) instead of couch-diving at a friend's place in ATL.<br/>-- General transportation costs--car rental, taxis, public transit (when running!)--versus having my car and paying (admittedly a lot) to park.<br/>...so a weekend con experiences goes from about $200 in gas, parking, and host gifts (*ahem*) to upwards of a $1000+.<br/><br/>* I, too, thought that PAX was mainly a web comics and video game conference.<br/>-- Yes, that's not exactly exclusive company relative to RPGers.<br/>-- But D*C has <i>four stories of convention space for gaming</i> in a major downtown hotel--does PAX really compare to that?<br/><br/>* Guests and "scene":<br/>-- Leonard Nemoy, Bill Shatner, Patrick Stewert, etc, etc versus ...? Tycho and Gabe? Kurtz? Maybe some MMORPG folks?<br/>-- No fewer than four major (for fandom) bands, who knows how many official parties, wicked fun goths and punkers and such. Might have all that at PAX--I dunno.<br/>-- I get "conned-out," it's one block in just about any direction to a cool pub, jumping bar, or other entertainments. Yeah, I'm sure that's a push, given we're comparing ATL and SEA.<br/><br/>So anyhow... thanks for pointing out that it's a useful venue for finding eager gamers who want something new. I did not know that. But if it stays opposite D*C, I might never see for myself, as long as I live in the Southeast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230835/#Comment_230835" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T11:36:51+00:00" title="September  9, 2009 11:36AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jared and Luke are dicks.

This is the main issue I believe, the "get the recognition they deserve, and by proxy, so do I, who self-identifies".<br/>- They think the games are fun, and want to help more people have fun (often assuming that they do not have fun now, even if implicitly).<br/>- They want there to be more people with whom to discuss the games they enjoy talking about. And for some people, they need more people to play these games with.<br/><br/>For most people, aside from the recognition issue, things are ok as they stand: They have enough people to talk to about the games (here), they have enough friends to play the games with, and they're not going to get more money or direct pleasure out of it.<br/>It's often a purely academic question.<br/><br/>I think a better question would be, "NW <i>designers</i>, why weren't you at PAX?"<br/>The people who speak otherwise of SG getting recognition and traction, it's as much <span style="text-decoration: underline;">idle</span> curiousity as it is wishing the success of an endeavour they have vested personality (not personally) in.

PAX 2008 was "58,500, including 45,000 pre-registered tickets." PAX 2009 used the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Convention_and_Trade_Center" rel="nofollow">WSCTC</a>, and outsold the previous year's entire ticket sales in pre-reg alone.<br/><br/>PAX is twice the size of Dragon*Con. The <a href="http://www.paxsite.com/schedule.php" rel="nofollow">schedule</a> should give you a feel for the tabletop game impact. Keep in mind that Tycho and Gabe have a WotC-tied in 4E podcast.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>what were the Top Three "Big Name" Guests at PAX?</blockquote>\nWithin what interest block? For trad tabletop gaming, guests included... pretty much the entire core 4E design team:<br/><br/>Panelists Include: Mark Jessup [Moderator] - (Director of Marketing Communications, Wizards of the Coast), Chris Perkins (Senior Designer D&amp;D, Wizards of the Coast), James Wyatt (Senior Designer D&amp;D, Wizards of the Coast), Mike Mearls (Senior Designer D&amp;D, Wizards of the Coast).<br/><br/>I guess you're missing Andy Collins. If you want a job in the video game industry, you don't care about these guys. You care about Wil Wheaton, and the promise of actual funding to the best pitch at one of his panels.

I'd probably say Wil Wheaton, Ron Gilbert, and, uh...

And while it does not draw names as big as those as Dragon*Con, its attendees are almost guaranteed to be gamers of some sort.  PC gamers, console gamers, card gamers, CCG gamers, RPG gamers.\n<blockquote>4) Were there any bands or "official" parties?

You can even see much of them by searching on Youtube for "PAX 2009".  There were several stages of Rock Band (RB2, Beatles, and Lego) for attendees to go up and play on.

I haven't gone the last two years simply because I've been unavailable. This year I chose to go to Kumoricon instead because I felt like I had a better chance of reaching my super specific target audience. And it worked. And I don't think I made the wrong choice. I do hope to go to PAX in the future, but if I have to choose between an event that is close to my target audience and an event that is absolutely my target audience,,, shit, where is the choice in that?<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>As a group, we freak the fuck out over Gen Con.

I went once, did pretty well, but decided it wasn't worth my time to go back. I was reaching an audience, but not my target audience. And that's what this is about, finding the right audience for our games. Finding the right places to meet and engage those audiences. PAX is (by all accounts) awesome. Kumoricon was awesome for me and my games, and I suspect more awesome then PAX would have been. Next year I hope to do both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230970/#Comment_230970" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T20:01:00+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  8:01PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>There was a Capcom launch party for RE4 on PC and also WotC had a big giant invite-only Magic party.</blockquote>\nOh yeah, I remember seeing the stuff about the Magic Party.

I've been a member of the PAX volunteer staff since 2004 (which is also why I'm not running games!), and while we attract more video gamers than rpgers (this being because there are 1000x more of them in the world to begin with) PAX has always set aside a significant chunk of space for tabletop games, from the very beginning.
