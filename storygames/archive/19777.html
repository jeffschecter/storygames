The "I'm Uli and makes donuts" thing, turned up a few notches. If it becomes like a story or RPG experience, that's great. Tense, paranoid\u2026 I want to go back to caring about the game. Ideally both sides should get some of this. We usually play with the Avalon roles backported to the cyberpunk edition.<br/><br/>So I see two routes: either it's a little Once Upon a Time ish where the leader would say things like "Ok, this mission is about stealing a briefcase from GRNDLs office." Evoryone would say things like "My role in this mission is to cut the right wires so the alarms don't trigger". We could roll a few story cubes to get people some prompts for this.Then, we say nothing as we shuffle up and reveal the cards. Then we cut to "What mabla happened out there! Alarms flaring, guards coming, bullets flying!" "Hey, I did my part, I cut the right wires, it must've been your schematic that was wrong"<br/><br/>The other route would be to have some tables to roll on or choose from. It would put people less on the spot. Putting people on the spot like that is a double edged sword - we have some players who loves to show off their creativity and on-the-spot thinking, while others are reluctant since they don't want to feel judged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438774/#Comment_438774" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-27T22:55:30+00:00" title="September 27, 2014 10:55PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some cards with two paragraphs: why you are in the resistance, and why you are a spy, could also be cool.

(After all, you're going to figure out that your friend Ben is a traitor because of the way he votes, and his body language, not because the fiction says he's a former government employee!)<br/><br/>But what about doing it the other way around?<br/><br/>Let's say each mission has a specific objective, independent of other missions. One mission means the Resistance finds the Death Star plans, the other means they manage to keep the Empire from finding planet Hoth. That kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Every role/player has a specific objective or impact on a mission. Maybe if Chew-D2 comes on the mission, he always creates a lot of Imperial casualties, because he's trigger-happy. So we know that any mission involving him means a lot of people are dead.<br/><br/>That way, a certain set of characters on a certain set of missions means a developing story: "We managed to get the Death Star plans, but because Chew-D2 was on the mission, there was a wild massacre. However, a little droid was on the mission, who is good at information science. So maybe he's got the plans now?" "Yeah, that sounds about right!"<br/><br/>You could also make fiction-specific "betrayal" cards. Instead of just generic sabotage, you'd have a whole bunch with different *types* of sabotage (e.g. "last-minute defection", "vital equipment sabotaged", etc.), and each player could pick an appropriate type of sabotage from the deck. That way, you could even try to guess which character might be using a certain type of sabotage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438806/#Comment_438806" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T03:51:48+00:00" title="September 29, 2014  3:51AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I like the board game The Resistance, but I wish to add some more RPG elements to it.</blockquote>\nI would remove the game part because that would interfere with "characterization". Turn all character card up so everyone knows who are the traitors. Play the game out like Battlestar Galactica. Have a few guidelines for scenes to be included.<br/><br/>The scenes in the first act should focus on establishing relations, hierarchy and professions on the ship. The game could have lists of examples.<br/><br/>The second act focuses on the mission and each person that is included in the mission. The leader could for example be forced to include as many people to the left as required for each mission. Instead of plot cards, the game can provide a deck of cards with suggestions of things that happens. The participants turns up 4-5 of those cards, and the characters on the missions select each one of these cards. Scenes are framed around the events of these cards. A card could for example change a character card to the opposite (red to blue or vice versa). Also, why does the leadership change?<br/><br/>The third act happens when either side gets three tokens. An epilogue is played out with any number of scenes to tie everything together. How are the people affected by the betrayal? What relations will be in focus? Will anyone survive? What will the consequences be for the people. Try to include at least two characters in each scene.<br/><br/>I left some things out, like who frames the scene, who got a higher hierarchy when it comes to deciding any "arguments", who the red and blue cards are representing, how the scene framing changes if a red role is the leader, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438816/#Comment_438816" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T10:14:50+00:00" title="September 29, 2014 10:14AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you being sarcastic?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438818/#Comment_438818" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T10:55:47+00:00" title="September 29, 2014 10:55AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, Rickard is quite serious.

It ends up with neither, unless the whole group decides on one of those two things. I got a fairly basic motto here based upon my own observations: you can't combine two playstyles to create a fully successful gaming experience. It will instead end in a compromise between those two playstyles.<br/><br/>I do have an idea that lingered in my brain for years, where you play two games at the same time that has nothing to do with each other, and if you want that then I'm all ears. The idea is like playing chess while writing a story together with the opposition. My thought is that one game will affect the other in some way, but they should never interfere with each other either in mechanics or fiction. Only the mindset that is required for one game should affect the outcome of the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438822/#Comment_438822" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T14:05:44+00:00" title="September 29, 2014  2:05PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (That's very interesting, Rickard!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438826/#Comment_438826" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T16:37:07+00:00" title="September 29, 2014  4:37PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't find the idea of simply attaching fictional roles to the players all that compelling, personally.

By people making up scenes and offering agreeing or disagreeing accounts of what happened, you can get a lot more of "so and so lied!" "I swear I saw so and so call the guards!"

Most prominent RPGs I can think of have an element of game to them, albeit with more open-ended victory conditions and endgame conditions. (Some have no endgame condition, but many at least have an implicit sense of when things should wrap up.) Some games (like Anima Prime) really push the mechanical optimization part, and are a lot more directed.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think it's a great thing to weave roleplaying and story into a typical game. It happens with all sorts of games. I could, for instance, see a version of Two Rooms and a Boom that's essentially a LARP. The mechanical elements are there to provide concrete anchors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438837/#Comment_438837" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-30T00:31:43+00:00" title="September 30, 2014 12:31AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My rule when doing two things at once, even if it's simple things like "putting mittens on while walking down the stairs", is to decide the order of priority between those two things. It's ok that the mittens get put on a little slower just as long as I can walk carefully, quickly and not fall. The priority is walking. That's also what helps me in matters of faith (I practice a syncretic religion).<br/>In this case, we have the three options of:<br/>\u2022 Keeping the resistance game play but adding more flavor<br/>\u2022 Creating a story game around the resistance structure but prioritizing the story<br/>\u2022 Trying to do both perfectly<br/><br/>My goal was always the first of these three. If someone genuinely wants to switch to the second of these three, that's fine (and interesting, I'd love to hear results) - I just wasn't sure it wasn't being facetious. To me, the paranoid game play of the Resistance as written is so valuable. I would not want to give it up for a cargo cult open cards version. And as I've said, I love Step On Up.<br/><br/>Now, even with the first of the three goals, my thinking is that story and RP can go very far even if they have to tread lightly to not break the game play. In the mittens analogy, the mittens are always on well before the last stair set. (And in the local sangha, first shikantaza gets sat for a while then the lamb gets praised.)<br/><br/>It's great to hear these out-of-the-box ideas. Rickard, if you were being serious, I thank you.<br/>I started this thread just asking for entries on a rolltable but it became an interesting green hat session. That's really valuable, I love story-games.com.<br/><br/>My position is still that I want to keep the game play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438838/#Comment_438838" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-30T00:35:13+00:00" title="September 30, 2014 12:35AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the weird cult stuff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438848/#Comment_438848" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-30T08:42:38+00:00" title="September 30, 2014  8:42AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely also think that in the vanilla Resistance, you have a better setup for roleplaying, because the first team votes are frequently a bit "blind". Avalon fixes this problem by adding roles for the "good" side that have more information, but I think this could work to your advantage! If everyone adopts a persona, then you start the early rounds by looking to players' characterizations for reasons to downvote their team. (It's a bit like how in Mafia/Werewolf, when you're playing with casuals, people get killed off because they look at you funny or something.)<br/><br/>Hmm. I wonder if the game would break if you extended the number of missions to 7. Because that'd mean you have more leeway for voting based on characterization, and not just on an analysis of "well, you were on that mission when it failed, so..."<br/><br/>I'd even go so far to say that it might actually foster the paranoia if you operated under the assumption that when the Resistance members run a mission, they part ways, each do their part, and then separately come back to base and compare notes. Which means that they're discovering what happened at the mission at the same time that everyone else did. Which means that the spies have to have explanations ready for what went wrong.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, here's how I see the flow going.\n<ul>\n<li>The Team Leader chooses their team, as different members lobby to be put on the team.</li>\n<li>Players vote on whether the team is good; once the team passes, move on to the next step.</li>\n<li>The Team Leader explains the plan to their members (and to the rest of the Resistance), assigning specific jobs to Resistance members, and then they go on the mission.</li>\n<li>Execution of the mission, and everyone "comes back to base" to check and see if it passed.</li>\n<li>If it failed, go into a round of "okay, who didn't take care of their part?"</li>\n</ul>\nThe "who didn't take care of their part?" doesn't have to be conclusive, and I think it contributes to the paranoia aspect more if it isn't conclusive.

No one knows exactly how it operates, but it is rumoured to have something to do with ancient sorcery.<br/><br/>Success: The rebels escape with the complete plans for the Death Star. (Mission: Infiltrate Death Star Construction becomes available.)<br/>Failure: The plans are stolen. However, the following sabotage cards are available:<br/><br/>* The explosives used to destroy the Secondary Data Banks failed to explode. (The Empire still has backup copies of all the plans.)<br/>* The agent distracting the sentries was strip-searched and questioned. (Some secret about the Alliance's plans may have been revealed.)<br/>* One of the agents appears to have been <i>possessed</i> at some point during the mission, and has strange gaps in his/her memory. <br/>* etc.<br/><br/>[The players each take one in secret before the mission, and any spy can, of course, throw one in to sabotage the mission.]<br/></blockquote>\nThe team leader could choose a mission to undertake before voting for the agents involved (or the missions could be grouped in a pack to start with - i.e., here are the five missions required to secure the rebel alliance's escape from Hoth, in this order).<br/><br/>Each player would lobby for being a good fit for a particular job, and, when the mission is completed, have to defend their character's success or failure in the mission.<br/><br/>This could be pretty entertaining, although you'd need some pretty hardcore fans to write all those playsets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
