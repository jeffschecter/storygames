It's a term used both in philosophy and art, similarly but slightly differently. I've seen it used in psychology, too.<br/><br/>It's often used to mean "rejecting the idea that there's a single way of thinking about things". Relatedly, it can mean, roughly, "the view that nothing can be definitely known". Chris uses it to mean something like "Self-knowing" or "Producing things with a knowledge of what's gone before". I've also heard, once, in a book I can't find, that "facsimiles" are a hallmark of postmodernism: postmodern art copies what has come before.<br/><br/>(Do discuss definitions in this thread, if you like, but if you cut-and-paste them from "authoritative" sources, at least try and see the irony.)<br/><br/>I can see Chris' argument: that many Forge games are self-knowing, even ironic. They're very aware of what's gone before, consciously trying to react to it. Perhaps something like "Drowning and Falling", an ironic copy of Dungeons and Dragons, could be described as postmodern.<br/><br/>But, to me, it's a weak argument. I go with Josh's argument: you <i>can't</i> argue that Forge games are postmodern <i>because</i> they revolve around a specific set of ideas*. Truly postmodern games would reject any single way of thinking. God knows what they'd look like, but not like indie games.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>* Edited slightly, so we don't have to talk about the Big Model.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234810/#Comment_234810" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T03:12:58+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  3:12AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't postmodernism revolve around Barthes, Derrida, Foucault and Baudrillard, and do not these writers feed off and interrogate each other?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234811/#Comment_234811" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T03:20:01+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  3:20AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There has to be a difference between postmodern and parody, I hope.

So I have a hard time accepting the idea that "[Forge Games] revolve around a single theory, the Big Model."<br/><br/>But more importantly, my gut's telling me that you're looking at this too narrowly. The role-playing hobby is only 30 years old, it has no long-standing tradition to reject or redefine. In other words, it doesn't seem right to me that you're trying to compare Forge games to non-Forge games. I think you should be comparing RPGs to other forms of story-telling.<br/><br/>And if you do that, than I think they start sounding more postmodern (to my uneducated ears, at least). There's an argument that RPGs are a rejection of the popular understanding of "story"---a rejection that there can ever be a "single" story, rather that each instantiation of a game redefines the "story" in its own unique way.<br/><br/>So while I shouldn't be making this argument, I think RPGs as a whole represents a truly postmodern artform, and Forge games are just a subset of that.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234823/#Comment_234823" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T05:49:38+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  5:49AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I like Chris' argument that many indie games were postmodern, although I don't agree with it.</blockquote>\nChris who? And where is the argument?<br/><br/>Also... Yeah, what Georgios said (though I'd have to read the argument to understood what they meant by PM).<br/><br/>I definitely feel that "indie" (here let me call them "hippie", or (gasp) "story games") are "post... something": A reaction to the previous paradigm of pretty much all RPG design, craft, and publishing. <br/><br/>But it wasn't "Modernnism" that forms this dialectic. It's (for back of a better word) "Traditional RPG" (for lack of a better word): Games where the only thing on your sheet are your Stats, your Skills, and your Combat Powers and Gear. While the dice used may vary, and the method of rolling them, this is the thing that these Story Games were "-Post". Also, post-distribution: There were very few who thought of "working with RPGs" to mean anything other than the following two things:<br/><br/>1) I will work as a writer for a major/minor studio until I build up my cred, and then eventually they will let me work on a large RPG project.<br/>2) I will self-publish my game idea: Now the first thing I must do is take out a mortgage against my house, print 2000 copies, and have them all stuffed in Alliance/Diamond's warehouse.<br/><br/>If anything, I'd call "indie games" (in the sense we clearly mean here: The hippie games largely inspired by conversations at the Forge with alternate play mechanics and distro) "post-distro" games.

These discussions go like this:<br><br>Player 1: "Well, in order to determine what happens next, I'll have to compare the blue triangle to that concept of conflict. If I consider the blank canvas that my character sheet currently is, really there's nothing I couldn't do."<br><br>Player 2: "Well, my blue triangle is actually only triangular because it refers to the trinity, so in that interpretation, you would have to make a moral decision about eating that cake."<br/><br/>Player 1: "Wait, what cake?"<br/><br/>GM: "Hold on, I'm referring to the rules." (looks in a blank book that only has an index that looks like an annotated bibliography, with lots of references to pipes and toilets)<br/><br/><br/>But really, these guys weren't all post-modernists. I guess it depends who you ask, but most of them were modernists, surrealists, minimalists... their definitions all kinda move around fluidly in that modern to contemporary realm that's become so mercurial in the art world anymore. Besides, we all know that post-modernists defy definition, it's all interpretive. <br/><br/>If I were to pick an art related term to apply to story-games, I'd say low-brow. Which, I guess is technically in the post-modern realm, but not typically what you'd think of as post-modern art. <a href="http://www.juxtapoz.com/" rel="nofollow">Juxtapoz</a> is a fabulous example. I relate this type of subculture in the arts to the type of subculture indie games and the forge represent in the gaming community. I know that puts me on rocky ground here, since we've had that discussion a lot on these forums (are we really a subculture? really?). But small press and homemade and all that, along with ideas and images that break away from the "traditional" norm of the RPG.<br/><br/>Maybe?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234837/#Comment_234837" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T07:18:39+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  7:18AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2009 7:19AM by Bill_White.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The notion that postmodernism is characterized by the rejection of a "grand narrative" in favor of <i>petit</i> or local narratives is sometimes adduced as a sign of postmodernism's lack of  internal consistency, in that the "retreat from grand narrative" can itself be regarded as a kind of grand narrative. I don't find that argument terribly convincing, in that it strikes me as cheap casuistry rather than a serious engagement with ideas. I'm prepared to regard postmodernity as an ideal-type conception rather than something that's embodied or enacted in unmitigated form anywhere. To my mind, a postmodern game will be more or less self-referential--possibly parodic, but in a way that deconstructs shibboleths of gaming rather than reinforcing them--or somehow render problematic the relationship between the act of playing and the resulting "diegesis" (fictional world). For an example of the first type, see <a href="http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_powerkill.html" rel="nofollow">PowerKill</a>, which describes itself as a "metagame" to be overlaid upon other games: that's not really a dungeon, it's a Vietnamese village. And you're Lieutenant Calley. A possible example of the second type is Han Christian Andersen's <a href="http://hca5.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/snow-day-published-version.pdf" rel="nofollow">Snow Day!</a>, in which it's not entirely clear whether, when you describe your ice monster thrashing a bully, it's "really happening" or it's just your five-year-old PC's revenge fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234838/#Comment_234838" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T07:23:09+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  7:23AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2009 7:24AM by timfire.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I was deliberately simplifying that argument, but I do think there's a case that many Forge games stem from the same way of thinking about RPGs.</blockquote>\nHmm, this is a tricky topic. Because there's a lot of agreement now, I think it's easy to get a skewed perspective on what the "golden age" of the Forge was really like.<br/><br/>As I understand it, prior to '03 or so everyone at the Forge was basically an individual with their own ideas about gaming. People's ideas didn't really start coming together until around maybe '03, when Ron wrote his "Narrativism" article. (When I joined the Forge in late '03, there was still a LOT of arguing about ideas going around.) But even then, I wouldn't say a "unified Forgian worldview" took hold until... maybe '05. And that didn't last long, in '06 there was the "Forge Diaspora" when everyone went off and started developing their own ideas.<br/><br/>So I don't think there was ever as much agreement as people seem to think there was. It's also worth noting that most of the memorable "Forge games" were written prior to '05 and a "unified Forgian worldview"... <i>However</i>... I will concede that the members of the Forge shared a particular mindset, even if they didn't agree about the details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234845/#Comment_234845" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T07:58:50+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  7:58AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that given the current concensous on how a (indie) game ought to be, and that concensous's rather clear connection to both a train of thought and a rejection of what came before it makes it pretty definitionally modern. <br/><br/>Correct me if I'm wrong but was not modernism (in art at least ) a reaction/break away from the traditional thoughts/methods of the enlightment art scene, in much the same way indie crowds break away from the traditional thoughts/methods of the dnd scene. <br/><br/>Lets look at an dictionary definition of<br/><br/> a style and concept in the arts characterized by distrust of theories and ideologies and by the drawing of attention to conventions.<br/><br/>~oxford english<br/><br/>Well definitely not the most philosophical of definitions I think it more or less works as is, notice the distrust of theories and ideologies. While drawing attention to conventions are definitely part of post modernism, I really don't think that's enough to make them postmodern or else every satire from then to now counts. The shared mindset that prevails in indie games should be. Another thing that gets mention alot is that post modernism often embraces what modernism rejected so in a sense, that means that satire has to be straight faced and earnest and taken to extremes, which is not something I see in indie games. <br/><br/>Oddly enough, the work people are doing as part of the 'Old School Renaissance' comes a lot closer to the idea than indie stuff. Its returning to the stuff that has been rejected in the past, often cranking it up to 11, it has a distrust of theory and ideology, it is pretty self aware of its place and the conventions , and doesn't really seem to me to have the over arching meaning behind it (its still old school Renaissance if your bringing back odnd, or traveller, or any of the 80's rpg's really or using their methods [lots of tiny little tables apparently and descending armor class])                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234851/#Comment_234851" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T08:14:07+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  8:14AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the major problems with Postmodernism is that there seems to be very little agreement about what it is.

For a game to be "philosophically postmodern" (or maybe "post-structuralist"), it should challenge assumptions about the relationship between the player and the game, the game and the fiction, the fiction and the real world. Think about how <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/1001nights.html" rel="nofollow">1001 Nights</a> sets up a situation where you have characters in-game telling stories to each other, in such a way that the characters are <i>themselves playing a role-playing game</i>!

"Playing yourself" and/or "shared characters" would be two major benchmarks, as I see it: the former blends the diegetic with real life (and real life issues; viz my <i>For Mature Audiences</i>) and the latter eliminates any (traditional) notion of My Guy.<br/><br/>Maybe just the fact that Story Now is so common in indie gives it a post-modern feel: The traditional game format being one of high competition or simulation (which both, perforce, involve extremes of character monogamy, be it for a plausible condition for "winning" or a necessary condition for "consistent embodiment"), the notion of stepping back from pawn stance to author stance could be another blurring of the lines between player and character (i.e. the character is a means, now, not an end).<br/><br/>I dunno, though...

"Playing yourself" and/or "shared characters" would be two major benchmarks, as I see it: the former blends the diegetic with real life (and real life issues; viz my<i>For Mature Audiences</i>) and the latter eliminates any (traditional) notion of My Guy.<br/><br/><br/>I'll accept that, absolutely.

It's still quite mightily up for debate whether games are artistic endeavors (okay, when I phrase it like that, they clearly are, but still), at least in the popular consciousness, but I firmly believe that many RPGs constitute a form of "acting/theater game" - at the very least, they're a method of getting grown-ups to engage in the sort of imaginative play that they would otherwise see (moreso, at any rate) as inappropriate, childish, etc. In the words of Jayne Cobb, "well, I guess that's something". <br/><br/>A high level of Derrida-style textual analysis is necessary to start thinking about what exactly game texts are. It's really important to remember, as has been said already, that our hobby is about 30 years old in its present form. War-gaming roots, LARPing, SCA, and their forerunners, the Spiritualism movement and its offspring, the neo-pagan movements of the 20th and 21st centuries ... all these things bring us to a point where someone derived a generic fantasy game from a number of literary texts, texts that themselves were neo-Romantic reactionary diatribes to modernism (Lord of the Rings, Conan, etc.).<br/><br/>I think the "back-to-storytelling" side of RPGs is one example of the further fruits of that neo-Romantic, literally post-modern{1} impulse - to embrace the modes and forms of one's ancestors{2} (or rather, my ancestors, if you have no Germanic heritage) and beyond, into territory that is decidedly wary of technology and the alienation and deadening it can bring (I'm thinking of the words of Ron Edwards in particular, here - hinted-at disdain for video games paired with talk of "brain damage" having been inflicted upon certain members of our hobby). Certainly, our allies in the board-gaming hobby, at least the folks at BoardGameGeek.com, have tinkered with an anti- or non-technology sentiment at times, using such slogans as "[proudly] gaming unplugged since 2000". It's arguable whether this is a conscious sentiment or a mere catchy tagline. <br/><br/>It's fascinating what the GMful and GM-less mini-movements in game design have wrought - to me, they attempt to engage or realize a democratic impulse in the creative process that, to some, is hindered or restricted by previous iterations of our hobby. This is actually where I fit in, politically - sort of an art-as-self-actualization process, where the point of play is to realize and activate both the individual's own creative voice and the individual's interest in and capacity for telling stories, while simultaneously reaping the fruits of an undeniably <i>group</i> process, which teaches the lessons of both improv theater (sharing authority, spontaneity, etc.) and a more communitarian mindset (streeeetch!).<br/><br/>{1} as opposed to artistically post-modern, which is obviously debatable<br/>{2} what is D&amp;D but an increasingly layered digestion of the Lord of the Rings, itself an adaptation of a German Romantic Nationalist opera, combined with a heavy layering of riffing on actual Germanic myth? No, I'm not being rhetorical - what do you think?<br/><br/>I think that, in relation to art and entertainment as a whole, RPGs definitely fulfill the criterion of "challeng[ing] assumptions about the relationship between the player and the game," and the fiction and the reader/user. Over time, RPGs have certainly devised new ways of interacting with the kind of experiences novels, board games, and video games provide - for the former, granting the chance for personal input and control, and for both of the latter, an infinitely greater level of flexibility, detail, and nuance becomes available. I think the parallel development of these different media creates a sort of pomo "re:" effect, in which, across different kinds of artistic endeavor, new and different ways of subject/object interaction arise. But, you know, mainly in RPGs. Video games' renegotiation of the art/audience relationship moves at the speed of technology, while RPGs have always had the fully "open" form of Free Play/Free Narration available to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234873/#Comment_234873" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T10:05:02+00:00" title="September 30, 2009 10:05AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I open this up a little bit?<br/><br/>Indie RPGs are postmodern because and only because all role-playing games are post-modern.<br/><br/>1) They're postmodern in time.

(Colin, by the way. Not Chris. I think that led to some confusion above.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Pettersson</cite>There has to be a difference between postmodern and parody, I hope. I'd put "Kill Puppies for Satan" and "Drowning and Falling" in the parody department, rather than the postmodern one</blockquote> Of course there is a difference. In spite of it, I'd say that KPfS and D&amp;F are both postmodern productions. The old "Murphy's Rules" cartoons, I'd say, are parodies. Medium awareness is key: KPfS and D&amp;F are themselves playable games, which show the flaws in the old structures by demonstrating new ones, and then point and laugh. "We've learned so much together!" they tell the reader. "Let's not suffer brain damage/design na\xefve sim games anymore." They aren't just the joke, like Murphy's; they're in on themselves.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite> <i>kill puppies for satan</i> is a particularly interesting case, because cloaked in the shape of a parody is an <i>invitation to transgress</i>. Baker makes the invitation all the more insidious in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>. It is a project undertaken with full knowledge that the audience <i>constructs meaning</i> for itself and does not receive it <i>passively</i> from the writer (cf. the Modernist urge in AD&amp;D to fix a pure scheme of morality).</blockquote> QFT. Very well said.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><br/>Or perhaps [postmodern games] explicitly reject the Big Model. If I designed a game that encouraged players to play in different ways* - some competitively, some just to enjoy being in the world - that'd be interesting.</blockquote> I think that the idea of coherence in game design, contra Ryan, is highly postmodern. Not ever game that understands coherence needs to engage it by blocking contributions from all but a narrow range of CA, though. One possible pomo move: "OK, coherence. What if I design a game that honors a wide range of CAs and harmonizes them, making them feed each other? Because screw coherence."  Sorry to bring CA and the attendant identity politics back, but it's what I mean.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>The notion that postmodernism is characterized by the rejection of a "grand narrative" in favor of<i>petit</i>or local narratives is sometimes adduced as a sign of postmodernism's lack of  internal consistency, in that the "retreat from grand narrative" can itself be regarded as a kind of grand narrative. I don't find that argument terribly convincing, in that it strikes me as cheap casuistry rather than a serious engagement with ideas. I'm prepared to regard postmodernity as an ideal-type conception rather than something that's embodied or enacted in unmitigated form anywhere. To my mind, a postmodern game will be more or less self-referential--possibly parodic, but in a way that deconstructs shibboleths of gaming rather than reinforcing them--or somehow render problematic the relationship between the act of playing and the resulting "diegesis" (fictional world). For an example of the first type, see<a href="http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_powerkill.html" rel="nofollow">PowerKill</a>, which describes itself as a "metagame" to be overlaid upon other games: that's not really a dungeon, it's a Vietnamese village. And you're Lieutenant Calley.[...]</blockquote> I was trying to work "Power Kill" into a post on the other thread. The New Style games seem like a watershed in so many ways \u2014 I was also trying to work in "Violence" and "Puppetland". "Violence" is an important milestone on the path to a culture that would enjoy kpfs, by my reading. If ever a (published, widely-read) game could be uncontroversially postmodern, it would be "Power Kill".  And man, that game is amazing. Everyone should play it at least once. Only takes an hour, tops. Totally worth it. "Power Kill" is a sandwich made of deconstruction and win.<br/><br/><i>A fortiori</i>, then, Seth Ben-Ezra's forthcoming game Showdown must be understood as a very postmodern deconstruction of sociopathic violence tropes in traditional games. "Rendering problematic the relationship between the act of playing and the fiction" is what it does best. Not only does it undermine the "heroic" traits of the protagonists in the fiction as we experience it, it undermines those same traits in the characters' self-images. In the best games, we're left with the hollow husks of the characters we thought we created, losers who resort to deadly violence because they have nothing left. It's like playing D&amp;D and Power Kill at the exact same time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>So I don't think there was ever as much agreement as people seem to think there was. It's also worth noting that most of the memorable "Forge games" were written prior to '05 and a "unified Forgian worldview"... <i>However</i>... I will concede that the members of the Forge shared a particular mindset, even if they didn't agree about the details.</blockquote> I wanted to bring this up in light of what Bill started off saying. Even though it's hard to put a finger on, as we saw elsethread, there is an underlying, hard-to-articulate "feel" to Forge (and diaspora) games, such that almost everyone agrees that game X is in the class, and game Y is out. Postmodernism is notoriously hard to pin down, too. The two ideas have that in common. So it's not surprising that getting one pulsating blob to sit still long enough to be compared to a different squirming mess is really hard. Doesn't mean it's impossible, though.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wrshamilton</cite>The community, DIY kind of aesthetics, and the general blurring of producer and consumer can be seen as postmodern.</blockquote> Especially the last. Also, the blurring of critic and author, and of theorist and author.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>I'd say that all roleplaying games are postmodern, myself.</blockquote> Pomo is a virus that tends to colonize everything it touches. Once you see the door in the fourth wall, once you get the ironic vision, it's hard to unsee it, or unget it. I don't know that the games of the sim-by-default era have any good argument to be seen as postmodern productions, but once there were enough of them, and a critical mass of people thinking about them, I think it was inevitable that the pomo memeplex would find its way into another yet-virgin medium. Only careful watch and warding can keep it out (the wholly unironic spawn of D&amp;D3, for instance, are still cute and innocent that way).

An RPG is a tearing down of every traditional understanding of how art is produced, how the author and audience relate to the text, and everything else that western art theory has constructed for centuries.  Instead of one artist passing art down to the audience, you have an inverted cyclical pattern where the artist and audience are one and the same, and everything else we know about art is up for grabs.  Creating even a thoroughly normal D&amp;D game is an exercise in identifying and deconstructing genre tropes from every action movie and fantasy novel anyone in the group has ever read.<br/><br/>RPGs have broken down the fourth wall, kidnapped the audience and dragged them up on stage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234889/#Comment_234889" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T11:52:47+00:00" title="September 30, 2009 11:52AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes I wonder if I'm the only person running Kills Puppies for Satan, straight and who the joke is really on. <br/><br/>I also find the concept of post modern as a kind of 'end of history' for art/creative things, but I gotta admit it has some validity. Pomo is in a lot of ways it seems to me , a lazy way to avoid genuine effort in either creation or criticism (pomo degrades criticism by refusing to create a right and a wrong in favour of localities and all that, and it degrades creation by placing all things as copy, derivitive and satire of what came before it. ) . This means that at the very least, when popular media is pomo we've essentially reached the end of history because there's no way to escape the pomo, as others have said, once you see it , its hard or impossible to not see it). <br/><br/>Interesting Thought, Thank you<br/><br/>L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234896/#Comment_234896" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T13:16:10+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  1:16PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>RPGs have broken down the fourth wall, kidnapped the audience and dragged them up on stage.</blockquote>Nick wins the thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234898/#Comment_234898" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T13:34:06+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  1:34PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Old School is clearly post-postmodernist in its attempt to return to the sincerity of the early roleplaying experience.

Baudrillard wrote against Foucault conception of power as knowledge power in <i>Forget Foucault</i> but beyond that is mostly committed to a Nietzschean reading of Marx and drawing out pataphysical critiques on consumer culture.
