I remember there was an example in the book for playing Richard of Gloucester.  His sheet looked like this:<br/><br/>Murder some heirs and be crowned king.<br/>Win a battle.<br/>Lose a battle.<br/>Seduce the widow of a man I killed.<br/><br/>And it worked like this:  Whenever you declared that one of those things was occurring, it did.  You automatically succeeded in, say, seducing the widow.  When all of your goals were crossed off, your story was over.  If it wasn't a goal, even if you were,say, losing a battle, something else happened.  I don't know what - maybe outcome was random, or somebody else decided or something.  In the dream it didn't matter.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about my dream game to me is that if your elements are sufficiently ambitious and free-standing, you can build them into a satisfying dramatic arc, and that you have a ton of control over how and when they occur.  So you'd have a semi-structured personal narrative, always open to dramatic opportunity, and you could pace a game by agreeing on the speed at which goals were hit.  If you kept to the program, everybody would resolve at the same time.  You'd probably want goals to relate to other player's characters, too, built in collaboration.  Or maybe you'd assign goals to one another as well as author your own.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114273/#Comment_114273" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T05:47:34+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  5:47AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, have you been reading my notes again?<br/><br/>This is almost exactly what the way that I'm structuring Urban Mythos right now.  Characters have 3 goals; short,  medium and long term.  Short term goals should be something which can be resolved within one or two sessions.  Medium term goals can resolve within roughly 4 -6 sessions.  Any time you resolve one of these, you create another one.  Long term goals are a bit different, they are your character's main thing which, once resolved, either ends their story or changes them massively.<br/><br/>The way it currently works is that your character's abilities are all Flags.  You can't achieve any short term goal until you have resolved one scene using each of your abilities.  You check them off, until they've all been tested, then you're able to resolve a goal.<br/><br/>Exactly hnow that's going to work in actual play is yet to be seen, but, I dunno, I like the look of it so far (on paper, at least).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114274/#Comment_114274" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T05:50:48+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  5:50AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there going to be a reward for achieving goals in Urban Mythos?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114275/#Comment_114275" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T05:59:07+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  5:59AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Is there going to be a reward for achieving goals in Urban Mythos?</blockquote>\nOh yes!  Currently it's character advancement in the classic "Your stats go up" sense.  I have reservations about that, it's early days for this incarnation of the game .  But definitely, there's a reward.<br/><br/>I'm thinking something along the lines of Burning Wheel's advancement rules tied into the Beliefs from the same.  Instead of those ticky boxes filling up and then giving you an extra level of the skill, they fill up and that lets you resolve a character goal, and THAT gets you some cookies, so to speak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114277/#Comment_114277" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T06:05:24+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  6:05AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That reminds me of <i>Sign In Stranger, </i>where you need to have five scenes related to an over-arching question about your alien hosts before you have the opportunity to answer it.

Here\u2019s how it works:<br/><br/>During chargen players pick a Destiny for their characters.  It can be anything they want really- become a god, become king, kill the obligatory Merlin/Gandalf/Elminster character in the Setting, marry a princess, whatever.  This becomes the culmination for their character.<br/><br/>The game sets an arbitrary point total to achieve this Destiny.  I think it\u2019s like 15.  Each point has some event or conflict tied to it.  Examples would be: Win a Fight, Discover an Ancient Relic, Find the Sword of my Father, Discover my True Identity, etc etc etc.  During chargen, the player of the character gets to pick 5 of these, another player gets to make up 5, and then the GM gets to make up 5.  I found this adds a lot of buy-in for everyone.<br/><br/>For most of the time, the PCs just go about doing whatever adventurers do.  There\u2019s some stuff in the game about being \u201cChosen Ones\u201d and having mentors and all that, but it\u2019s just Color.  However, whenever a PC gets into a situation that fits one of his points, he can declare a Destiny Moment which gives him a bonus die for the rest of the scene.  If the PC succeeds in whatever the point event calls for him to do, then he gets a Destiny Point.  If he fails, then he has to earn 2 extra points.  Each one of these new points has a new event/conflict associated with it- the player makes up one, the GM gets to make up the other.  It\u2019s not much of a punishment really, but it does raise the stakes of Destiny Moments just enough to discourage people from just blitzing through them.  Besides, I haven\u2019t had anyone blitz through them anyway.  Making the story last and be enjoyable is a big part of the fun.<br/><br/>When a PC gets all 15 points accomplished, he can declare a Destiny Fulfillment.  In this case, everyone drops what they are doing and helps the player get an opportunity to achieve his Destiny.  If the player succeeds, story over (although the rules do allow for him to choose a brand new Destiny for his character if he **really** wants to keep playing it).  If the PC fails, he has to choose a new Destiny with 15 events/conflicts that should be based out of the failure of the first one.  But I don\u2019t see this happening too often.  There\u2019s just been too much buy in by everyone at the end to let the failure happen.  And the players (at least mine) like to collaborate on their Destinies anyway.  One game they even all chose the same one- \u201chelp the rightful heir to a throne reclaim it.\u201d  It was pretty cool.<br/><br/>It almost matches exactly what you were talking about.  Except, there\u2019s only one Destiny instead of 4 or 5 like your dream.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114294/#Comment_114294" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T07:13:52+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  7:13AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is like Nine Worlds' Muses.

Or to one of your own goals, if that seems natural to you as you conceive your character.<br/><br/>Here's another thought about this which is floating around in the back of my head: Not all goals will get resolved.  It's tempting to say that experience is something you get when you don't get what you want.  When a character realises that they have failed to achieve a goal, that they've got into a position where they'll never get what they want and the character accepts that, then that's a pretty powerful thing there too.

I think if you worked really hard and were lucky, you could resolve one every three or four hours of play, and there are so, so many questions to tackle.  In some ways <i>SIS </i>isn't a good game to compare to, because the structure is pretty novel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114330/#Comment_114330" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T08:37:11+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  8:37AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I have a feeling the dream game would feel a little flat, given the absolute player fiat aspect.</blockquote>But if it didn't fall flat, you could have an extraordinary degree of narrative control, making it more of a writing game then a straight RP game. I think there's something really fun lurking in there. If you were enjoying this aspect in a dream, why not enjoy it out here, too?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114340/#Comment_114340" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T09:26:34+00:00" title="December 14, 2007  9:26AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you'd buck up against the Czege Principle pretty hard and fast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114352/#Comment_114352" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T10:09:07+00:00" title="December 14, 2007 10:09AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is also similar to my Goal System for Mage Blade. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary: <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the beginning of the game, the group collectively selects an End-Game Goal.. This is your major plot arc thing. Destroy the One Ring. Slay Torak. That sort of thing. Then an End Count is set, which creates a pool of points divided evenly among all PCs to set their character's Foundational Goals. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen create characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen begin/continue/finish setting Foundational Goals, which are goals used to set up your character's place in the narrative.. Starting them on toward their own ultimate personal goals, as well as the End Game Goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom completion of Foundational Goals, you get points which can be used to improve your character and set new goals of one of two types: Rising Actions and Falling Actions. Accomplishing these goals also gives points used to improve your character and set new goals. <br/>\n<br/>\nRising Actions are goals that push toward the End Game Goal. When these are accomplished, the End Count (which was set to zero at the beginning of the campaign) is incremented by the number of points invested into the Rising Action. You receive twice the number of points invested back upon accomplishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nFalling Actions are side-quests, goals that are interesting and fun, but don't push toward the End-Game Goal. When these are accomplished, their points are deducted from the End Count (to a minimum of zero). You receive a number of points back equal to what was invested upon accomplishment, and an equal number of points in "Alternate XP" which has various uses not currently fully decided.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM is obligated to put opportunities to accomplish the goals out there. Basically, that's all he's allowed to do. Anything he introduces must be related to one or more players' Goals. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe interaction of Rising and Falling Actions upon the End Count allows the players to organically set the pace of the game to their liking. When the End Count reaches it's pre-determined limit, the game enters End-Game, and all unresolved Goals are brushed aside or resolved quietly. At this point, any further preparations needed to move directly into accomplishment of the End-Game goal are done, and then you go into whatever scenes are necessary to resolve the End-Game Goal, one way or another. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, the campaign is over. Normally, that would mean you'd go play something else, start a new campaign, or what have you, though there aren't any rules against moving straight into another campaign using the existing characters, if that is your wish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
