I did not ask out of an immidiate need of content to finish a deadline until tomorrow or anything like that. I have just noticed that this seems to have become a very common practice. And I have no experience of my own, so I just wanted to get some fragments from experience of the SG crowd and to hear how people go about that practice.<br/><br/>To somewhat answer your question I would imagine that I would mainly use licensed photographs and perhaps other artwork.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209221/#Comment_209221" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T06:18:50+00:00" title="May 27, 2009  6:18AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2009 6:23AM by J_Walton.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends.  I love istockphoto and places like that, but recently I've grown slightly more skeptical of them.  I was browsing through shutterstock recently and found some artwork that I would love to have in my game, but I <i>know</i>, deep down in my heart, that whoever posted the artwork doesn't really own the rights to it (because it's semi-famous stuff made in China during the 1970s).  Sure, they fraudulently posted it there and I could argue that it's their bad not mine, even if I use it, but that's not really how it works, unfortunately, morally or legally.  So I think that, especially when you find cases where the stuff made available seems questionable, that you do some background research and make sure you're actually getting what you think you are, especially in regards to licensing rights.<br/><br/>There are sites where the work posted is more carefully vetted by staff, or at least appears to be.  Getty Images, for example, is a major licensor of photographs to magazines.  Normally, those kinds of licenses might be out of the price range for most indie game designers, but I was able to negotiate a limited license for a photograph that I sadly haven't used yet.  So there are all sorts of options to explore.  Additionally, there are a number of pro-quality photographers, designers, and illustrators associated with the indie scene (Elizabeth Shoemaker, Daniel Solis, Fred Hicks, Jennifer Rodgers, northerain, etc.) who would, in most cases, love to create work for interested parties, so that's always a great place to start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209222/#Comment_209222" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T06:33:15+00:00" title="May 27, 2009  6:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For Play Unsafe, I used a stock photo for the cover.

I understand that poor verbiage confuses people. Perhaps I am a bit denser than I would like to think. But that's ok. But still, the link you gave is also very fitting. My plan is to get a game on paper before the end of the year or so, (game design is done, quite a bit writing left, though. ) so I might very well need something like this for that (it will be in Swedish only).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209282/#Comment_209282" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T12:36:12+00:00" title="May 27, 2009 12:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was fun to watch one thing which has never happened to me before.
