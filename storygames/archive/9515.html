I'm always partial to the former, just so I can make it work with anything from D&amp;D to Sorcerer:\n<blockquote>Well, traditional GM-and-player games have successfully had games with tons of setting minutia for many years, with GM as gateway for which and how much detail gets introduced. However, the implication of the various sorts of advice (perhaps as a result of self-selection in audience tastes) has been for a level of detail that ranges from minimal to moderate, never super-dense. I'm sure for many groups that's a very good thing. I mean, I'm the only one in my group that likes even to read Victor Hugo, let alone to play a game with that level of detail, tangent and exploration in their leisure time.<br/><br/><b>What if, With Great Power-style, you couldn't advance the plot before you introduced, created, or interacted with a certain number of very specific setting details? (The former two could be requirements for the GM, if there was one, or all three could be available for all players.)<br/></b><br/>I don't really agree that IAWA's oracles are a great idea for this. You get four oracle pulls per chapter, and a highly limited cast is a feature, not a bug, in that game.</blockquote>\nIAWA's oracles were brought up. While awesome for doing what they do for that game (starting you off creating setting at the beginning of each scenario), this "Use With Great Power style mechanics: You can't get to the Next Level until you've done something with the setting" idea is... well, frankly, pretty mindblowing to me.<br/><br/>In a mini-campaign format (say 9-12 adventures, or maybe 6 with a laser-focused group), you could simply do something like this:<br/>* The game has 3 'arcs': Beginning, escalation, and finish.<br/>* You can't break into the next arc until each player has authored at least one setting element that reflects their character, and one that is general for the world (for example: A knight character's player would write like 3 paragraphs about "Rituals of the SuperKnights" or something).<br/>* You can't advance into the next arc until each character has come to terms or interacted with at least two of the following 4 setting elements ("The Shinto Priesthood, Buddhism, The Samurai Caste, The rulership/hierarchy of the domain of Torigoe", etc). What constitutes at "interacted with" is up to the players and GM.<br/><br/>Advancing the Arc could also hold things like "everyone will gain a leap in power" (Storyteller: 3 attribute dots, 6 skill dots, 4 "power" dots; D&amp;D: 3 levels; etc) as something that separates one art from the next: Each arc is a jump forward in time/focus a little, which brings with it an advancement of the characters as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, just a thought. Other ways to make this work in a way that doesn't require designing a new game from the bottom up?<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>But yeah, some sort of definite... thing... that you can use in a real way to be a checklist for the players interacting with, using, and creating setting for a game. And if you don't, the game won't advance beyond a certain point.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211011/#Comment_211011" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T20:09:47+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  8:09PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This idea is way cool.

Your characters are off investigating something, and have a clue to the next thing, but now the players have to come up with an in-fiction excuse to go visit the Shinto Priesthood? Hmm, now that I write it, it does sound like it could work. But I'm not a huge fan of drifting in general, so I think it'd work best if built into a game from the ground up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/twilight" title="twilight"><img alt="twilight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/twilight">twilight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211012/#Comment_211012" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T20:25:06+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  8:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D; (3.5 and 4E) claims that experience is scaled at 11-13 encounters per level.

So in some way, advancing your character is developing (or revealing? interacting wi) the setting.<br/><br/>This is pretty interesting to me too, and while I'm not sure I have the answer, I've got a few touchstones for this. Back in AD&amp;D, when your monk reached a certain level, you had to go hunt down the next guy above you and defeat them in battle. That little rule implies a whole world of setting possibilities. AD&amp;D didn't particularly help you actualize that potential, but that's another story.<br/><br/>Another is John Harper's Freebooters scenario for TSOY. It comes pre-loaded with PCs with a strong motivation on their character sheet to engage some setting peice for a tangible reward. The sneaky part is that the setting bit is so vaguely defined that the player starts to shape it to their own vision almost subconsciously the moment they start to engage with the rules. Lady Blackbird has this technique written all over it.<br/><br/>For bringing this stuff to a new game, I'd recommend pre-gen characters that need to engage the setting to advance in the story and the character sheet, or else sitting down with the players and making up characters that do this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211018/#Comment_211018" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T21:29:16+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  9:29PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dgkg6pcn_24dxtq4zhd" rel="nofollow">Coolmap</a> sets out to do exactly this (yes, in a new game, but you could adapt it).<br/><br/>It's based on Verge, actually.

Persona is like a key that rewards other people for treating your character like the bad ass they are. One of the things I had been stumbling over is the fact that some are time based and others are not. Especially with Thematic Batteries this clears up a lot of things. <br/><br/>I am imagining a system where the character creation sets out some guidelines for what kind of story you will tell. Not mapping it out but setting the registers so we all know when it is time for the story to take a turn.<br/><br/>The sort of things which this could do are: A certain Key stipulates that in the first arc the player must help the character suffer so that in the third arc they can be vindicated. Or the second arc isn't over till some element has been brought in which triggers the key change which allows the character to proceed. I know this isn't as clear as it should be but the idea has my mind racing a little too fast (especially at 5:20 in the morning) I will think about this and let you know if I get anywhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

However, in the course of play, we came across a bunch of setting details that either needed to be dealt with beforehand or swept under the rug by a carefully worded sentence or two (which is also a way of dealing with them).  I had never really considered the possibility that the rules might be totally functional, but the setting text might need to be playtested to shake some of the kinks out and figure out how people would make use of it.  Now I'm convinced that a lot of the lame setting texts that I've read in 300-page tomes over the years could have used more thorough playtesting to identify the stuff that was actually useful to players.<br/><br/>To tie back into this thread a bit, I think rules that specify ways to interact with the setting -- of which there are many types, like Keys etc. -- go a long way to solving this problem by ensuring the reverse, that the setting is actually tied into the rules and what the players actually do, instead of being simply background fluff that never really matters in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211061/#Comment_211061" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T08:29:01+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  8:29AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>and what really tweaks your interest is advancement mechanics</blockquote>\nHmmm, good point there: I was kinda focused up there on "character advancement", but actually "story advancement" is more like what I'm looking at. Again, the original idea from JD (which I latched on to) was:<br/><br/>- Just like With Great Power's "Comic Arc Thingy", you hit a "block" of some kind that you can't advance beyond until you do a few things first.<br/><br/>In WGP, the effect is twofold: The players can't "advance the plot" to a point where they can actually beat the enemy. Also, in the process they gain the power to do so.<br/><br/>In other games, I projected this to character advancement. For example, in an arc campaign of some kind using D&amp;D, I'd still do advancement in the normal way... but between arcs I imagine there would be a break of a few years in the gameworld (see: Star Wars, etc), when the next session starts, the players would be 5 levels higher than whatever they were previously, and the new story arc would begin.<br/><br/>I think I was doing this because in these games (WoD, D&amp;D etc) through the progression of the game it's expected for the characters to gain more power as they go on. In games with no XP/advancement per se, there wouldn't be any need to address character advancement.<br/><br/>But essentially, what I meant to focus on was a sort of "the game has arcs of some kind; and to advance to the next arc, you need to have a significant interaction with the setting" (I'm thinking both at the character AND player level, because I like the thought of players contributing to campaign wikis and the like). And this is for games that play out in at LEAST a "mini campaign" of 6-8+ sessions, if not a fullblown campaign: It would make little sense for a one-shot game, or a game with less than 4 sessions (unless there was like one GM and two players or some other small group config).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211064/#Comment_211064" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T08:53:47+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  8:53AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite><br/>Otherwise, in a D&amp;D game, how does this work?

If it's a dungeon crawl adventure, people are not going to be coming up with priesthood stuff, instead they will be introducing things about the civilization/jerkoffs who built the dungeon and then leaving books and clues and puzzles behind based on those details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211075/#Comment_211075" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T10:44:45+00:00" title="June  9, 2009 10:44AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2009 10:56AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Andy,<br/><br/>I think this is done in play all the time.  But maybe I'm not reading you right.<br/><br/>I'm the GM.  My players make 1st level characters.  I buy some 1st level mods, throw 'em all on a map, feed the players some hooks, and say "go!"  Now, I also have some 6th level mods I want to run.  But I don't want to put them on the map and entice the players to wander into something that'll instantly kill them.  So, I put them on another map, and call it Plane X.  Then, I decide that the Rod of Seven Parts opens Plane X.  I then strew the 7 parts all over the map of 1st level mods -- sometimes a part is within a mod, sometimes it's between them, whatever.  I imbed each rod part in a piece of the setting I want the players to poke at.  If they don't poke it, they don't get the rod part, and they can't open Plane X.  Somewhere in the course of play I make sure to tease the hell out of Plane X, so the players want to get there.  Maybe I even hand them 1 of the 7 parts to get started.  Eventually, I can be damn sure they'll go after all 7, and interact with whatever they must to that end.  Assembling the rod is worth some amount of XP that gets everyone to 6th level.  Ta-da!<br/><br/>To get away from D&amp;D advancement, it's not hard to apply the same structure to information revelations in a series of investigative arcs.  Turn the rod into an encrypted manifesto which, when deciphered, lets you know that the cult you've been tracking is just one arm of a larger and more dangerous organization, up to evil deed X in location Y.<br/><br/>If this is different than what you envision, could you highlight the differences?  Is there a specific <i>kind</i> of arc you want to support?  Is there a specific <i>type</i> of player-interaction-with-setting you'd like to see?  I can think of a lot of really different ways to go here, from a "collaborative world-building" focus to an "each arc addresses a different personal issue" thing.<br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211171/#Comment_211171" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T15:24:24+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  3:24PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah, <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dgkg6pcn_32dfmzgrq8" rel="nofollow">paths</a> are also relevant to this discussion, it seems.

I'm not sure if it's what Vincent intended or not.<br/><br/>I don't know With Great Power, so I not be undestanding the same thing as you for "arc".<br/><br/>We start with a map with a bunch of things on it, and a town with a bunch of people in it. The players have relationships to these things. They have a relation to a person in town because it says so on their sheet. They have a relationships with thing X on the map because it's the locus of a problem for the town (because the GM says so). All these relationships are vague at the start.<br/><br/>As the characters advance, these relationships get fleshed out. The GM fleshes out a map, location, for example, as the lair of the bog beast that's eating sheep. The players extend this setting piece by dealing with the bog monster. How they do it decides what this setting piece ends up being in the end. Maybe they kill the monster. Now the bog is safe. Maybe they placate it. Now it's a guardian spirit for the town.<br/><br/>The same goes for relationships. The players engage their relationships because they want something useful for the next quest. When they do this, the relationships morph, change and grow.<br/><br/>Eventually we hit this arc point where the characters are the toughest people around. Their town depend on them. The landscape was formed by them. Now the time is ripe for them to move beyond their little map into a bigger world. At least that's where I see StWT ending up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211201/#Comment_211201" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T17:57:45+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  5:57PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is what the With Great Power plot arc does for you.  Of course any comic book game with a GM can accomplish a comic-book-like arc with the villain winning in the beginning and the heroes winning at the end. Some even represent this with a currency that moves from villains to heroes over time (Mutants and Masterminds).  Nothing wrong with that at all, one love.<br/><br/>But it's sometimes hard to tell when you're playing where you are on that arc, and if you think you're closer to the end than the GM does, you are frustrated with how hard you're trying and still not winning, and if you think you're further away, you're let down because the ending was such an anticlimax.<br/><br/>With Great Power indicates that until the heroes "give", i.e. lose, 5 scenes with conflict against the villain, they absolutely cannot stop the villains' plan. They can stop the villains, incarcerate them, whatever, but the plan continues to move forward until it has beaten the PCs a minimum of 5 times. (The PCs can choose to lose more than 5 times, of course, and there are additional story advantages to doing so as well.)  You never have to guess where you are. You never have to wonder why what you worked so hard to do didn't work - because it can't work, not yet. And of course when you finally have all 5 losses under your belt, you're enthused. NOW you can make your move.  It's not that WGP provides some means of pacing other games don't have, or some brilliant insight into comic book structure, a decent set of GM advice, which many superhero games have, can address that. What WGP brings to the table is <i>transparency</i> of pacing.<br/><br/>Now, turning to the setting question...I think we should back up and identify what it is that we would gain from doing something like this. Maybe it's a horror game and the monster can't attack until you've had a conversation with 5 different people at high school. That way when the monster kills one of them you have some basis for a reaction. Then we would be gaining the "oh my god, they killed Muffy and the whole cheerleading squad!" without having to rely strictly on pre-play relationships with every single person that might become monster chow, which gets a bit tiring.<br/><br/>For a Thick Book Fantasy setting, what is it about exploring setting details that is fun, and why might we have too little of it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211351/#Comment_211351" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T10:26:27+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 10:26AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also note how one of the requisites for "level up" in Storming the Wizard's Tower is having introduced a new character type in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211356/#Comment_211356" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T10:42:16+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 10:42AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had this idea of "timers" sitting around on the workbench for a while...

Sometimes that's okay, but often in leads to little disagreements or slightly inappropriate character actions. Detail, much like eloquence, enhances our ability to communicate, and even to form thoughts, enhancing the meaningful aspects by exploring and negotiating them. For example, a peasant's reaction to step out of the way might serve to establish the social order, opening the possibility for the PCs to act within or against that social order.<br/><br/>Now, to tie that in to detailed settings and story advancement. Is it really story advancement we're looking for, or could it also be done through setting development? If you look at a setting like a big character sheet, you come to understand that it can change and develop. Who forces it to change? The characters do. How many stories have you read/watched/played where the main character(s) changed the world? For example, with the abovementioned peasant stepping out of the way. What if the characters sought to change the world such that the peasants had right-of-way over one or more other social groups? A detail, seemingly minor, then becomes part of a complex larger system. During the escalation details make excellent delaying actions. During the climactic part of the story, details become tools with which to address the major problem.<br/><br/>That's another part of it: detail brings flexibility. Give me a club, I can hit things. Give me a sturdy stick and I can hit things (club), lift things (lever), make light (fire), walk with a hurt leg (cane), create music (drumstick), and more, but only if the game allows those things to be meaningful. One way to do that is to say, "you decide what's meaningful." The other way is to make the game such that those things are meaningful, and that means detail. Detail can suggest possibilities that someone might not think of if just asked, "you decide," but also potentially restrict other possibilities.<br/><br/>So, how to represent all this mechanically? I look at games with lots of attributes for everything and cringe at how much work it'll take. The tendency to think of game worlds as a collection of objects is a bit problematic, though it is possible to steal some tricks from <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">illusionism</a> without falling too far into that habit. For example, make Joe the innkeeper. The PCs may go to five inns, but it isn't until the fourth inn that they really start to interact with the innkeeper. That becomes Joe, who is quickly given a few local tweaks, but thankfully doesn't have to be built from the ground up.<br/><br/>That's one way. Another way would be to reorganize how you record the setting as one or more characters (perhaps each country is a character, or each social category). Then you've got to decide how to advance/develop the setting. Odds are it should reflect how PCs advance/develop. I think that deciding upon the method of representing the individual aspects of the setting "character" should come last. These "attributes" should be able to present details of the setting, allowing the construction of elements (NPCs and such) by using the details as building blocks. You could go the other way, creating NPCs and such from more abstract concepts, but I usually find that results in somewhat generic NPCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212500/#Comment_212500" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T19:36:23+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  7:36PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><a href="http://zamiel.livejournal.com/1008605.html" rel="nofollow">I actually had a pretty cunning integration between <em>WGP</em>-style transparent plot pacing and <em>Capes</em> mechanics on my blog a while back.</a>.</p><p>A brief excerpt of the start:</p><blockquote><p>Then it hit me, in combination with some thinking I was doing on the idea of meta-Conflicts.
