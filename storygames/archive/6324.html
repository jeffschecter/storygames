It came out of a specific game I ran in late 06-early 07, <a href="http://www.apocalypse.gen.nz/slayerseast/html/home.htm" rel="nofollow">Slayers East</a>. This game was a revival of a much-loved game from five years prior, but the earlier version had seriously burned me out and I was reluctant to go back.<br/><br/>The trick of it was, the players in SE loved to dive down into their characters and not worry about anything but playing those characters in the moment. And that was great, except that we all wanted SE to emulate the form of a TV series. Turned out, surprise surprise, that emulating a tightly structured form like a TV series imposed some burdens on the game that didn't mesh well with how people were playing.<br/><br/>These rules set a balance point between these seemingly contrary needs. TV Action is an entirely traditional GM'd game overlaid with a jacket of metagame indie stuff. Players take turns to be the focus of episodes; when they're in focus, they get to do that immersive dive they love so much, and when they're not, they share GM duties and generally work on keeping the TV-episode structure going strong.<br/><br/>It worked well for us. We got some incredible stuff out of play, and this engine felt like it was contributing and definitely it wasn't inhibiting. At the <a href="http://gametime-nz.livejournal.com/profile" rel="nofollow">Gametime_NZ</a> livejournal I recorded the process of development that got the game this far and then the episode-by-episode rundown of the game in progress. The game website <a href="http://www.apocalypse.gen.nz/slayerseast/html/home.htm" rel="nofollow">Slayers East</a> has more info and context and some sweet group photos.<br/><br/>Anyway. Here it is, I hope some folk might like to take a look. Maybe its something of use or interest to the SG crew. I'm definitely interested in hearing any feedback or ideas - I'm not done with these rules, not by a long shot.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?tkwjb01jygp" rel="nofollow">TV Action</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139911/#Comment_139911" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T06:09:30+00:00" title="April 16, 2008  6:09AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting pitch, Morgan.

And relatedly, I don't have any pressing design questions apart from "does this work beyond our particular group?" These rules were a custom-made hack of game rules we knew into something that was particularly suited to the people we had, the way we played in that game, and the kinds of stories we wanted to produce. I do not know if it generalises to other people/contexts at all. I hope it does - it would be neat if these rules scratched a general itch - but whether it does is not for me to say.<br/><br/>When you have an episode/session as Screen Presence 1 (outright stole the Screen Presence stuff from PTA), you're a minor character in terms of the story in the episode. You can still turn up a lot, but the story focus and interest is distinctly not on you. So first and foremost, your role is to be cool with that. In the TV structure there isn't space for everyone to be the focus - in SP1 episodes you sit back and take the pressure off.<br/><br/>SP1 characters have only a few 'Saves', the resource that lets you adjust a dice outcome into something more favourable. High SP characters get more potential mechanical intervention; low SP characters get less, because the episode isn't about them. <br/><br/>Beyond that, SP1 involvement as GM is framed as invitational, rather than obligatory. Some of our players were really into it, others weren't so into it, so each player could decide for themselves what involvement they wanted given the baseline of 'this episode isn't about you'.<br/><br/>Invitations included:<br/>* to run NPCs as needed<br/>* to take direction on how to run these NPCs to make the episode go<br/>* to frame scenes - two scenes in the episode, of any description (including the ability to bring NPCs 'onstage')<br/>* to use all of the above elements to push towards the mini-climaxes that were act breaks, push the episode's theme, stop it getting extensively sidetracked, and generally make it feel as much like a TV episode as possible<br/><br/>In practice, SP1 characters were almost always brought in on the basic plan for the episode, so they knew which direction I was trying to push and they could lend that sort of weight.<br/><br/>(There's a whole other discussion about how we avoided predetermining the episode story, considering we had two or three people each ep pushing in a particular direction. Mostly it was because we tried to push for particular Bangs, while leaving open how the players would respond to each Bang.)<br/><br/>That make some kind of sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140094/#Comment_140094" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T14:07:45+00:00" title="April 16, 2008  2:07PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It does.

(Apart from anything else, it\u2019s a hack of a freely available system (Ian Marsh\u2019s Time Lord) and not respecting that is pretty much unthinkable.) <br/><br/>I suppose my main goal is to have this game serving others as lots of the games I\u2019ve seen serve me \u2013 as inspiration fodder. I have a hard drive full of game pdfs, most of which I\u2019ve looked through enough to grok and put in my mental library of neat stuff. For example, this design is a deliberate attempt to make a hybrid game that brings some indie sensibility to traditional play, and there\u2019s a lot of that going around (in D&amp;D4e no less). I like to think my efforts here could inform future games chasing this sort of effect. So for my main goal to be achieved, I want it to hit some kind of awareness threshold such that some people know its there to look at, and the basic ideas have been discussed and considered by people with different perspectives and more game design experience than me. <br/><br/>Secondary goal is conditional on response. If there are people who are excited by the purpose of the design and would like to play, then great. If there are people who want to engage with the ideas and try and make them work better, also great.  I\u2019m totally up for chasing this and trying to get the engine working better (either straight-out better, or just in a way that hits a broader audience). When I said in the earlier post I\u2019m not done with the mechanics, I mean that I recognise they will need work to provide generally awesome play. But this is only a secondary goal. I\u2019m not actively going to push TV Action as a game project for play or for further development. There is no marketing strategy for this game.<br/><br/>Yeah, so. Get some response from people about the ideas, in the process getting the game seen. If there\u2019s more interest, taking it further. That sounds right.<br/><br/>(more on your other question later)<br/>(and do consider yourself invited to whisper or post the stuff you self-censored, if you like!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/morgue" title="morgue"><img alt="morgue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/morgue">morgue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140144/#Comment_140144" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T02:02:51+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  2:02AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [back!]<br/><br/>So, TV Action vs PTA.<br/><br/>Now I love PTA, I love it hard, but it wasn't a match for this group on account of its denial of actor stance. You can do a lot of actor-stance stuff in PTA, but it keeps booting you out into author or (usually) director stance. We did discuss it, but pretty quickly it was obvious that it was wrong and we needed something that did most of its work in a traditional RPG mode, because that's where the group felt comfortable.<br/><br/>TV Action says "Yeah, you can have your actor stance through all your big moments. You can't all have it every week - some weeks you got to help out - but the reward is when you get your moments, you won't get booted out of your zone."<br/><br/>That's the big one. It might even be the only one. TV Action is, very deliberately, an attempt to make a game that can be played in a "traditional" way that is as informed by PTA as its possible to get.<br/><br/>Hmm. I guess that sounds right as an answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140168/#Comment_140168" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T06:14:56+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  6:14AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Word.

In the specific game this system was dev'd for, we were playing a variation on "team of folk vs. big bad", so it made sense for there to be one person running the Big Bad consistently. That way, even though episode-to-episode the players exerted influence over the story, the overall season arc had a coherent flow and could deliver surprises etc.<br/><br/>The original inspiration for this format actually came from a GMless approach to another game. I am a huge fan of Wraith but the intense personal focus of each character didn't seem to lend itself to normal group play - the characters had lots of reason to hang out alone doing their own thing, and not much reason to get together and spend time with others. Back in about '99 I was making notes on running Wraith so you'd have only one <i>player</i> each week - everyone else would be collaborating to run the game around that player, and stepping into play as their characters as and when they came onstage. So each week you'd get a session told from a different point of view, exploring the world around these loosely linked characters but keeping the focus on their individual journeys rather than imposing some forced rationale to have them team up all the time.<br/><br/>I never ran that Wraith game, but I'm sure it would be functional. That idea of switching around the role of "player" was the spark for this system.<br/><br/>(Here's another link in case someone's read this far down the thread and decided, yeah, I'll take a look at this: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?tkwjb01jygp" rel="nofollow">TV Action</a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140264/#Comment_140264" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T17:21:57+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  5:21PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The PTA hacking has begun. <i>Excellent.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140361/#Comment_140361" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T12:02:58+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 12:02PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2008 12:03PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Morgan,<br/><br/>I don't know if you remember me e-mailing you last summer about gaming in Edinburgh, but your reply and advice led to meet up with Joe Murphy, Per Fischer, and Gregor Hutton, so thank you for that! They're very cool folks.<br/><br/>Now, the interesting coincidence is that the game I was working on at the time had pretty much the same design goals as yours, except that it wasn't meant to emulate television. The idea was to allow heavy traditional "immersion" for the players, one at a time, while maintaining a fluid sort of story creation mode that would draw in non-participating players. One major design goal was "keep heavy-handed GMing, while blocking people from railroading," so the outcomes of the story surprise everyone.<br/><br/>I've played it with super-traditional grognard gamers, and they loved it. (Oddly enough, the game I played with hardcore Story Gamers Per Fischer and Gregor Hutton didn't go as well!)<br/><br/>So, the short version: I'm definitely going to check out TV Action, and I'll let you know what I think shortly!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140395/#Comment_140395" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T14:38:46+00:00" title="April 18, 2008  2:38PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, very interesting.<br/><br/>It looks to me like our goals about what gameplay feels like are similar, but applied at a different scale.

Scott - thanks for that - the "take the lower" / "doubles = 0" model might well be a better choice. <br/><br/>The 'beat the difference' system is from Ian Marsh's Time Lord (<a href="http://www.torsononline.com/hobbies/timelord/main.htm" rel="nofollow">available free here</a>).<br/>When we started our Slayers East revival game we discussed whether we should keep it or not. There was universal agreement that we wanted to keep the kinda goofy dice mechanic, so we did.<br/><br/>My major innovation to the core mechanic is stalemates. In Marsh's original rules, if you didn't roll over the target number, you failed. That was often confusing in play and because the probability curve is steep, it can make small differences hard to overcome. I added a rule that if you equal but don't beat the target number, you end up in a stalemate, with no success but no cost of failure either. It worked out much better in play - way less confusion about what a dice result would mean, oddly enough. And the existence of a 'stalemate' outcome tied in well to how Saves seemed to want to work.<br/><br/>I usually favour conflict systems that deliver stuff to the narrative/fiction/game every time - and a stalemate outcome seems like the opposite of this, making some dicefests end up with nothing changing at all. In play, however, stalemates came up just infrequently enough that they weren't frustrating, and often the context of a conflict would change during the stalemate so that it did feel as if the fiction was advancing effectively.<br/><br/>Again, I have to emphasise that this was a hack on to an existing game, so some of the decisions (like the difference dice mechanic) might seem kinda eccentric!<br/><br/>Paul - what's your game? Has there been a thread on it that I missed? (All too easy for that to happen, some months I'm at SG daily, other months not at all...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140591/#Comment_140591" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-20T19:27:28+00:00" title="April 20, 2008  7:27PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Morgan,<br/><br/>That makes sense to me! And I think that stalemate-type situations can spice things up, increase tension, etc.<br/><br/>The game I was referring to hasn't really been discussed here, so you didn't miss anything. It's called "Land of Nodd". You can check it out <a href="http://ihousenews.pbwiki.com/f/Land of Nodd.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, if you're interested. If you read it, let me know what you think, but it's probably best not to do that here, in your thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141440/#Comment_141440" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-27T14:46:11+00:00" title="April 27, 2008  2:46PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Morgan,<br/><br/>Also check out Alex Duarte's <i>unWritten</i>. Your game, his game, and my game have many different parallels and crossover--no two are alike or share the same parts, but any given two have a whole lot in common, which is quite interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
