                    Here is my first of three games that I plan on posing an AP on. If I'm not clear or you want more details, comment and I'll be glad to expand and elucidate.<br/><br/>PTA: Secret Lives of Suburban Spies<br/><br/>Once again, Primetime Adventures proves that it forces even the wildest concepts into possible concepts for TV viewing.<br/><br/>The players were Darren, Matt and Bowen. Matt and I have recently become good friends. Darren was Matt's friend and Bowen was a newcomer for all of us.<br/><br/>I tried a new technique with the pitch and it didn't necessarily provide the most awesome funneling of ideas but it did make me feel better about grabbing the reins of the process and forcing people to move around into new areas, out of possible safe zones.<br/><br/>First, as Bowen and Darren weren't very familiar with PTA (and I don't think Matt had ever played), I went over the basic concept of how we were going to pitch a show. This was after Matt made sure that everyone was onboard for a game of TV emulation (I'll let him tell the story of why) and had probed Bowen for his TV tastes.<br/><br/>After this, I explained some games I'd been in and how they'd worked out. (Star Trek: Badass and Workers in the City) Confident that the groundwork had been laid out, I told everyone that they'd have to make a pitch or modify a pitch somehow. I encouraged the use of the phrases, "Yes, and ..." and "Yes, but ...". However, to my recollect, it wasn't used (except maybe by me to show the potential). What really went on was two hours of idea bouncing. We (thought we'd) settled on a game about how post-war Nazis were responsible for saving the world from what had been found deep underground. We were ready to start, but the room was too loud and we moved to a spot in the lobby. I made a comment reminding everybody (my raucous self mostly) that we should be aware of our<br/>word choices and volume.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is where PTA's magic shone again. Character creation forced everyone to choose issues to resolve. And (some of) the forced setting options faded away. We ended up with a 1950s military town where Nazi scientists were housed to work on technology for America. The premise ended up being, "How do you deal with being handed the (fake) American dream but with more lies and secrecy than in wartime Germany?" Themes we decided to hit on and successfully did were: Loyalty (the scientists were surrounded by their previous colleagues but answered to the American military) and Lies. Hmm, Loyalty and Lies might be a good title.<br/><br/>We couldn't think of a third descriptor for either Bowen's or Darren's characters. We left those open. Darren played Janet, a the Nazi version of Jane Goodall with bionic gorillas. I remember that we never brought her Connection in to play. Matt played Ernest, a scientist with worked with self-replicating machinery. Bowen basically played a super-spy but I can't remember his character's name right now. Matt forced us (in a good productive way) to make our last names mean something about the characters but for the life of me I can't remember them right now. Matt, help!<br/><br/>I normally don't use Personal Sets or Next Week On with con games but I wanted to this time and boy did they work out for our scenario. Time was running out so I had us frame scenes at everyone's personal sets to establish the characters (by the way, this was a pilot). We started Bowen's character at the baseball diamond and we went from there to Ernest's living room and finally to Janet's martini bar. This all happened due to the fact that gameplay, whether intended or not, started focusing on everyone's family. Boy, did these foils rock! Lots and lots of fun was to be had with having the players play their character attributes when all of the NPCs were already set to react to them in some way. The Personal Sets ended up being character driving places and allowed easy riffing (which was a term I had to explain to Bowen, as a side note).<br/><br/>Finally, the Next Week On took the game from awesome funk enriched to awesome holy crap funktagious. We found out, just in quick blips, that the Nazis were surrounded in the town by their new counterparts, the Cold War powers. No one in the town was what they appeared to be.<br/><br/>As a GM, I had a great time. Everyone stepped up and brought the fun. I enjoyed trying out new techniques with the players. Consciously, I did a flashback with one of<br/>my narrations which lit Matt up like a Christmas tree. Unconsciously, we had a scene's stakes be a double set of stakes, which was implicit in pre-narration discussion of<br/>the stakes but wasn't brought out until afterward. Matt caught this and made me proud that we'd done something so cool.                </div>

                            For a first experience playing PTA, having admired it from afar, it was marvelous. I'm really glad it was with Mark as Producer, as he brought some practical experience to the table.<br/><br/>After Fred's experience at DexCon with the guy that didn't like or know TV, I was very explicit with our unknown, Bowen. Fortunately, we all ended up with some nice similar tastes to reference. Matt Wilson, if you happen to read this, I think this should be explicit somewhere (the next edition, on the website, etc.): everybody should talk about the shows they know and love, as it gives everyone a common frame of reference. (If this is already explicit in the rules, I apologize - it's been a few months since I read them.) If we had a problem with the game, it was that we spent *way* too much time discussing premise. However, it meant we ended with one that *really* jazzed us, even if it evolved as we made characters and started play.<br/><br/>Sadly, we never officially named the game, although we came up with several good ideas (aS.S.imilation, SuburbanS - I came up Secret Lives of Suburban Spies after the fact - it sounds good, if not 100% accurate).<br/><br/>Hopefully the others can correct me if I'm wrong, but Bowen played Frank Smith (I tried to talk him into Jones as a variation, but I think he felt it was too close to a certain Dr. Jones), Darren played Janet Goodbody (IIRC), and I was Dr. Ernest Brightman (I forget who suggested the last name, but it wasn't me). I love logonyms, especially for something like this.<br/><br/>Darren's scene had the conflict-within-a-conflict, with interesting repercussions. The stakes were: if Darren lost, his character confessed feelings for my character to my character's wife (apparently we'd had a thing back in Germany), and if he won, he got the sympathy of my wife and Bowen's character's wife for having Girl Troubles. After the fact, I realized that the conflict also involved breaking cover or not. Losing, Darren's character broke cover, slipping into a slight German accent and talking about the Good Old Days.<br/><br/>This lead to a nice snippet of Mark's preview for the next episode: Bowen's character's wife (AKA Mrs. Smith) was *also* a US agent and had to eliminate my character's wife for Knowing Too Much. Fred Hicks, who had arrived and was listening in suggested the ultimate spin: my wife was a Russian agent and might not go down so easily. In fact, we described a scene of me standing in our kitchen doorway, with my wife at the sink...cleaning her gun. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As a side note, I argued in favor of a pilot rather than a finale because I felt it was better to walk away wanting more, rather than wrap up something we only kinda knew. I would play more of this game in a heartbeat!<br/><br/>Fan-fracking-tastic.                        </div>

                            Dread: A Corpse with No Name<br/><br/>Shane, Scott and I showed up for the first of a whirlwind set of sessions of Dread with its benevolent, talented, machismofied created Rafael Peralta. I had been pumped by ancient APs of it from the Forge by Andy and just plain by Andy. I felt a little weird playing in the middle of a hallway but had great fun.<br/><br/>I've already responded to the game on another thread, but I guess I'll go into the game some here.<br/><br/>I played a Sorcerer because I chose my high stat to be Soul. I was Priest, a soldier that had survived Vietnam and turned to the priesthood to satisfy my soul. However, I was wrongfully accused of molesting children. At the point of suicide, I was picked up by a biker Angel and made into a Disciple. If I had chosen Body, it would have been a Warrior (?) and if Senses it would have been an Investigator. I chose spells that I never got to use and felt bad about that. Having never played, I didn't know the pacing and so I didn't know if casting a spell on some mooks would have blown my wad or if I should have just blasted away. I usually ended up using my stuff, but I never felt like I knew how much power I had left (even though I knew my spells per day limit, I didn't know when a new 'day' was going to be narrated in).<br/><br/>Here was the blurb:
<blockquote>Last night, you got the call from one of your contacts: during a high-society dinner, a rotting corpse suddenly appeared out of thin air. It screamed for a few seconds, then leveled a bony finger at table 14 (whose diners included the chief of police, the mayor, and the CEO of a local pharmaceutical company). Next day, the cops found the mayor's wife -- well, most of her -- on the steps of St. Mark's. It's another mess for you to clean up. This scenario serves as an introduction to Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, a fast-paced game of demons, shotguns, and white-knuckle horror-action.</blockquote>
Despite the fact that Rafael told us that the tape we'd acquired from that freaky scene held nothing, Scott decided to rip something out of it anyway. Not to undermine him, Rafael went on. Maybe the hallway had bad acoustics? I was sitting right beside Rafael and had a hard time understanding him anyway. Now we knew a name. We ended up going to a warehouse with some mafiosos where we were discovered. We intensely slaughtered them and took a video camera that they had and some heroin. As far as I know, we never used the heroin. We watched the video and saw another sickening and gruesome scene involving a demon with multiple external stomachs mutilating a woman. We went to the that crime scene and I found out I hadn't read my walk through walls ability well enough. So, I stripped nekkid and turned invisible and went inside. I gathered more clues and ran out before the fun could begin - i.e. when my invisibility wore off. (Stupid me!)<br/><br/>We were then pulled over by a mafia don. We negotiated with him after giving him some information about the things that were going on. He let us go, which surprised us, and we went to the morgue to confirm some information (which led us to fully discerning the nature of the demon - without an investigator, it's very difficult for this stage of the game). We knew who the final target had to be with this information, but didn't know her location. We called the don, and he informed us that he was tracking her down, too, but for different reasons.<br/><br/>We went to the new house complex that was being built and took over the scene. We were much better and figured out where she'd gone to. We were being followed but didn't know it. We found her trying to traverse a log while keeping her trail to a minimum, but the demon was following her. I used a spell which would make my words harmful to demons and started telling him some Biblical verses (I can't remember what, it wasn't awfully inspired). Then the mafiosos jumped us. Shane and Scott held them off and I held off the demon for a little while. The girl ran off and we got back Fury for that.<br/><br/>I remember casting another spell but not what it was. Shane was plugging it with a shotgun and Scott ... Scott ... decided to wrap it up in duct tape. Shane grabbed the demon by its jaw and shot it off while destroying the demon's head and we had the jaw as a souvenir. <br/><br/>I'm ready for more gaming with this game and can't hardly wait for its release.                        </div>

                            Hey, Mark, great synopsis.  I was really curious to see how that session would go, because it was the first time I'd played Dread outside my gaming group in three or four years.  It was a blast.  I really liked Priest (and Rowe and... damn... Shane, what was your guy's name? Whole weekend's a blur, now).<br/><br/>I was also curious to see how much of the backstory would reveal itself during gameplay.  Your crew hit most of the major locations and found most of the necessary clues, but ultimately, the primary objective was killing the Xarualac demon, which you guys did in style.  Your use of the Malison spell (the ability to harm demons just by speaking to them) was interesting to me.  Usually, people just curse the demon, or say something snarky ("You ready to die, mothafucka?").  But you were quoting scripture and performing the litany.  That was great, real in-character stuff for an ex-priest.  In campaign play, I'd insist that we research the actual rite of exorcism.  That would just be really freaking cool.<br/>

Hmm.  For the record, it's Rafael Chandler.  I think you've got me confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_peralta" rel="nofollow">a better man</a>.<br/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>I used a spell which would make my words harmful to demons and started telling him some Biblical verses (I can't remember what, it wasn't awfully inspired).</blockquote>
No, it worked.  It was good.  In fact, I got it on tape.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>I'm ready for more gaming with this game and can't hardly wait for its release.</blockquote>
Kickass!  It was great gaming with you.<br/><br/>In the other thread, I alluded to some of my concerns regarding the communication of the Disciples' disregard for the law.  But yeah, since you mentioned it, the hallway location wasn't ideal.  However, I should point out that when I asked the con organizer about running some games, they were already tight on space, and that was the best they could do.  It was really cool of them to create space for the game, and on the second day, I was able to run the game inside a room.  Lesson learned: next year, make convention plans far, far in advance.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

A transcript follows:<br/><br/>[The three Disciples are battling with a Xarualac demon in the woods.]<br/><br/>MARK: Like when Jesus cast a demon out of somebody's soul or whatever, I'm casting him out of the world.<br/><br/>MARK (in the voice of his character, PRIEST): "In the name of the Father, the Son, and the mothafuckin Holy Ghost, this world is not yours, and you <b>will</b> be leaving it soon!"<br/><br/>[MARK rolls dice and casts Malison, a spell that allows the caster to injure a demon just by speaking.  MARK rolls an extra die for the vivid description.  RAFAEL rolls dice for the Xarualac demon.]<br/><br/>RAFAEL: A three and a five.<br/><br/>[RAFAEL looks at MARK's roll]<br/><br/>RAFAEL: Oh, shit.<br/><br/>MARK: Three twelves.<br/><br/>ALL: (laughter)<br/><br/>[Because multiples are added to the number of instances, three twelves equals fifteen (3+12=15), and that is ten points higher than the demon's highest roll -- which was a five.]<br/><br/>RAFAEL: Ten points of damage...<br/><br/>SCOTT: If we ever needed it, we needed it now.<br/><br/>MARK: Wow.<br/><br/>RAFAEL: The demon screams.  As it turns around, you can finally see it...<br/><br/>MARK (in the voice of his character, PRIEST): "I said that in English, and you know you don't want to hear it in Latin!"                        </div>

                            Finally, I have two AP reports for Tenra Bansho Zero. The first was run by Andy and the second I ran.<br/><br/>Both sessions were either run as or based off of a scenario that Andy authored called <i>Shinobi Gift, Shinobi Curse</i>. Having played it before, it affected my gameplay as I felt bound to try different things that I had done or seen before (despite the fact that no player playing a character would have recognized any 'old' actions).<br/><br/>First, SGSC I:<br/><br/>I was set to run PTA. I was upset that someone had taken my table despite some half-hearted attempt on their part to offer to move (only one person mentioned it and I was getting bad vibes from the others). I hope no one was driven off by the fact that no one at the table was there for my game. Anyway, I noticed that Andy had only one player (Fred) and that Tobe across the way was sitting empty, too. I invited him over to Andy's table and we settled on TBZ. I think I had to run do something because when I got back they had chosen their characters. Fred was to play an animated wooden doll slash cultural repository and Tobe chose the annelid user -- a human with insectoid symbiotic aliens bound within their flesh. With a few choices left to me, I took the samurai, a soulgem-studded powerhouse that could tap said gems for a Hulk-like growth in mass and power. (Nobody is a samurai unless they have these gems, otherwise they are just warriors). I think I took this character on recommendation as I'd already interacted with the character on a previous game, and didn't want to fight those good memories. In the end it all worked out. By the way, we all chose women characters.<br/><br/>We ran our zero acts and our characters came alive. Fred had a great idea about having his character being on the run from the daimyo with her creator, running for thirty years. Someone set the scene at her capture and I jumped in as the aged creator, whose desire had transformed into fatherly love over the years. I really enjoyed the scene and Andy twisted the knife at the end, making her return to the daimyo an almost insignificant thing.<br/><br/>Tobe was the unwilling recipient of the annelid, and Fred's doll was there, too. It was hailed as the highlight of a festival and the scene was liquid awesome. Real surprise on Tobe's face, rejection, the cool but off reactions of the doll, it was all there and all well done. I was okay to sit it out and hand out coins.<br/><br/>My zero act was not hitting on all cylinders. I couldn't figure out what I had a choice in doing. The scenario was that a caravan I was protecting with some other samurai were routed and I, having survived by running away, was almost dead in the forest. Luckily, Tobe came along and we interacted before I fell into her arms.<br/><br/>The reaction matrix rocked our relationships like it was supposed to. Man, I love that thing!<br/><br/>The scenario revolves around an item of much valuable to all the wrong people arriving in town, clutched by a corpse of a techno-priest-intelligence agent. The characters are tasked with returning it to the tecnho-intellegencia-priesthood before consequences arrive. We decide to make a ruse of it by dressing up and concealing our identity. Unfortunately, we run into some of the Fingers of Hell, a gang with at least one notable albino samurai, attacking a vegetable farming family's cart en route to town. We were soon discovered (because I played the ruse to its dramatic ending.) We dispatched them all but two, leaving the albino and a lackey. I ended up showing mercy to the albino and the lackey ran away. Fred did a great job with being effective despite a prime directive against killing. Tobe did an awesome job with the family, taking a prize cabbage as payment.<br/><br/>We got really drunk in town and I made a point of trying to live up to my character's matrix on Tobe's character, which meant a sort of embarrassing scene with me trying to get some real feelings out. That was awesome. We were attacked that night by a kongohki in the form of a wolf. A kongohki is like a robot formed from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana#Etymology" rel="nofollow">Vajra</a> with the soul of a dead human bound inside. Fred's character, knowing that the item we were ferrying could control one kind of robot, leapt for the box and shut down the bloody beast. Time was up and we ended there.<br/><br/>SGSC II:<br/><br/>So, I had (barely) prepared a scenario based of a <a href="http://www.kabuki21.com/ga_no_iwai.php" rel="nofollow">kabuki play</a> where the players had to take revenge on Suguwara no Michizane and had the characters done but not really much else. We added those characters in the mix, and Andy, Bowen and Stephen were ready to play an altered version of the scenario, using the little bits I'd come up with but mostly based on Andy's design.. Bowen chose the samurai, Stephen chose a kick-ass ninja and Andy chose an Armor Slayer, an ex-mecha rider that fought 30 ft. tall mecha on her own with a sword as big as the sky. Zero acts ran long but really set the feel well. Stephen and Bowen did an awesome job showing how their characters were fleshed by living people. Bowen's act consisted of nearly the same scenario I'd been given, but I gave him something to do: backed up against the steps of a temple, protecting the few innocents left in a burning village from the onslaught of armors and samurai, he would choose how he lost, the only caveat being that he survived. Bowen's panache was excellent and I grabbed the albino samurai and let me debut early. Bowen was easily winning but was outnumbered by bowmen and ran off to live another day. Stephen was competing with his sister in the ninja version of capture the flag and won handily. By the way he gingerly treated his sister when he could have easily made sure she wouldn't get to her flag first, I made him protect that sister for the rest of the session. Andy I basically sped through and dicked over in his zero act, but he really made me see his character suffer as I ripped her out of the armor she was in by another armor, stealthy and black. A dead samurai stopped the hand from crushing her but died on top of her, permanently screwing with her innocent world view.<br/><br/>To keep Andy on his toes, I changed key elements to his story. Instead of the priest floating up, I had Stephen's sister character find it and lead her brother to discover it. Instead of the wizened elder confidently setting the characters to task, I had a young, questioning man reluctantly force them from the village. And instead of the Fingers of Hell attacking, I had the wolf attack the caravan that they led this time (but the albino was in the shadows). Again, Bowen stepped up with some florid descriptions and Stephen seemed to be having fun as well. Andy got the package out to take down the wolf and made it attack the albino. The wolf couldn't fully defeat the albino, who sunk into the shadows. We were about out of time and Andy ended up leaving early. We fast forwarded to the end of the scenario with everyone set to go Asura, which is a neat part of the game. Basically, as you drive towards your goals, you risk going insane and bringing down havoc on everything you hold dear. Michizane was raising an island from the bottom of the ocean and threatened to flood the entire coast. The package that they were returning to the temple was actually the activation device for this doomsday. It would take the work of all of the characters doing exactly what they did in the zero acts to save the world. Bowen's samurai went insane and destroyed the armor army (and their albino leader) that had surrounded the temple. Stephen's character and his sister captured the flag while being attacked by wolf kongohki, and Andy's character fought virtual armors to hack out the activation device and stop the island.<br/><br/>I'd offer more but the details get fuzzy. Ask whatever questions you have, but otherwise, I have completed my AP report. Now you all know what I did over the summer.                        </div>
