We covered the World Burner and the nucleus of Beliefs for the characters, but haven't done any more than that: no characters have been burned, no dice have been rolled.<br/><br/>Background:<br/><br/>At the table we have Dave, Greg, Claire and myself.  As the only person who owns BE, I'm GMing.  Nobody has ever played or run BE or BW before.  I've read the book.  Well, I've mostly read the book.  I skimmed some parts, like the details of the lifepaths, but I know the jist of what we're doing.<br/><br/>We were supposed to be playing something else, but since Claire wasn't feeling up to running that for work reasons, I stepped up with some BE goodness.  The plan was to burn a world and possibly create character beliefs, which is pretty much what we achieved.<br/><br/>First Mistake:<br/><br/>I slightly mis-remembered the way this whole thing worked and told the players to shout about any character concepts they wanted to play as and when they occurred to them so that we could make sure those characters were viable in the game while we were burning the world.  This caused a slight bit of confusion when we reached the whole FoN part, but we muddled through.  I think that the book is suggesting a process along the lines of:<br/><br/>Create the world<br/>Create the society<br/>Create FoN on both sides<br/>Pick FoN from the Human side to be the PCs<br/>Adjust word and society to suit characters if required<br/><br/>What We ended up doing went more along the lines of<br/><br/>Suggest character ideas<br/>Create the world<br/>Adjust characters<br/>create the society<br/>Adjust characters again<br/>Create FoN on the Vaylen side<br/><br/>It seemed to work out ok.<br/><br/>What we ended up with:<br/><br/>We went through the World Burner pretty much as described.<br/><br/>Location:<br/>Outworld.  Probably part of the Dunedin Worlds, although this was not formalised.  We'll have to work that out prior to proper character burning.<br/><br/>Atmosphere:<br/>For whatever reason, everyone seemed very psyched by the idea of a Partially Life Supporting world.  I suggested the topography from the planet in a book I read a couple of years ago: A planet mostly covered by a toxic wasteland of gas reaching a mile into the sky, but with high altitude plateaus which have an atmosphere suitable for human life.  The plateaus are mini-continents, islands big enough to support reasonably large cities and nations.  Some other plateaus have a slightly different culture, although there is a central government for the whole planet.  The climate here is mostly Mediterranean, and it's about now that the Spanish theme starts to emerge, with the possibility that the other cultures might be Catalan and Portugese themed.<br/><br/>Topography:<br/>Broad Range is the obvious one.<br/><br/>Tech index:<br/>We settled on Low.  High was appealing, but Low seems to be the default and for this  game we really thought Low was probably just right.  We haven't yet chosen an area of High Index tech, that needs doing.<br/><br/>Dominant Government:<br/>We discuss this and a couple of players already have pretty neat ideas about characters.  Dave wants to play a manipulative holyman with a political bent.  Greg's thinking some military type and Claire wants to be queen.  Pretty quickly though, everyone settles on a Theocracy, but a heretical one (at least, from a Mundus Humanitas POV).  The planet is "ruled" by a Prophetess who claims to be able to see the pre-ordained fate of some things.  Her "great insights" have been vital in governance of the planet.<br/><br/>In reality, she's a very talented politician with a very good PR department.  Although something of a savant and more than a little hatstand.  But she's an effective ruler.  The rest of the MH see her as a heretic, but have other problems to deal with right now and she doesn't really seem to be doing that much harm.<br/><br/>Claire decides that she'll be playing the Prophetess.<br/><br/>Factions:<br/>We add Imperial Bureaucracy and Indigenous Life-Forms.  The Imperials do not rule this planet, but represent the greater power of the Empire here and it's interests.  Also, something lives in that toxic nastiness down there.  Although we haven't decided exactly what yet.  I'm in favour of something huge and spidery, but I want to spend some time looking over the Alien Burner before we go into that in any real depth.<br/><br/>Prediminant Military:<br/>Religious Order gets picked pretty fast.  Greg decides his Military character is the Cotar Fomas in charge of Hammer forces, because "Spaceship battles are fucking cool".  A sentiment we all share.<br/><br/>Attitude the the Vaylen:<br/>We fairly quickly settle on Hysterical Fear, for a few reasons.  Dave decides that his character is from Jord, the a nearby planet which fell to the Vaylen a few years ago.  The population are understandably scared about this, and the Prophetess has exploited this to cement her position.<br/><br/>Primary Export:<br/>Raw Materials.  Something is mined down in the depths of the toxic filth down there and someone suggest that it's some kind of crystal.  Because it always is in these things.  The crystals are used in the sensor arrays of Hammer vessels and vital for certain types of guidance systems.  In and of themselves, they're pretty useless.<br/><br/>Quarantine:<br/>We decide that a planet in this type of situation is likely to have Advanced Quarantine.  It's decided that spaceports have to be away from the main inhabited "Islands" on smaller plateaus.<br/><br/>Economic Regulation:<br/>Tight.  This is more to do with the government than any Vaylen threat.  Recreational Drugs and Sex Trade are totally outlawed.<br/><br/>Then came the FoN.  We'd already created three on the Human side, so we just created 3 on the Vaylen side.<br/><br/>Hector - Witchfinder General: It was decided that the military on this planet have 3 branches: Hammer, Anvil and Secret Police.  Hector is the head of the secret police, the Witchfinder General if you like.  Greg's character thinks Hector is purely out for his own interests and thinks the man a fool.  He has a belief along the lines of "Hector is a twat.  Don't rely on him for anything: He'll fuck it up."  Claire's character has a belief along the lines of "Hector is my shield and armour.  He will deal with my problems"  One of Hector's beliefs is "Dave's Character is a heretic: He is not devoted to the Prophetess.  Wait for him to expose himself and then strike!"  He's genuinely out for himself too: "The Prophetess is useful for now, but I must gain more power if I am to secure my position beyond her reign"<br/><br/>Pachjo - Senior shop steward at one of the mines deep in the toxic nastiness.  The only Vaylen on the planet.<br/><br/>Venka - Mundus Humanitas Cotar and Imperial lackey: He HATES the whole regime here.  A prophet, and a female one at that, offends the MH and must not be permitted!  His beliefs are "This Prophetess is nothing but a charlatan and a heretic.  She must be destroyed if Rostrus is to be saved!"  Politics prevents him from striking directly: He's here to oversee trade between the Rostrus and the rest of the empire, not to wage a holy war.  "The Madeupium must flow!" is another Belief for him.<br/><br/>So that's basically the setup.  There seems to be plenty of crossplay between the various FoN.  In some ways, I'm tempted to pretty much forget the Vaylen at the start of the game: I think the players are going to have their hands full with Hector and Venka to be honest.<br/><br/>Thoughts?

The Vaylen-Human dispo countdown would represent whether humanity had succumbed to crippling fear or had discovered their heroic nature. Or something like that. But the Infection stakes would be set along those lines: If the Vaylen win, humanity eats itself alive with hysteria and we begin to see the collapse of society (as represented by a change in govt or something); if the Humans win, we become focused and fearless (as represented by a change from hysteria to "well informed" or somesuch).<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101269/#Comment_101269" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T09:52:17+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  9:52AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vcool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101291/#Comment_101291" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T11:14:18+00:00" title="October  5, 2007 11:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thor, I looked that over today actually, after Andrew Kenrick pointed it out.  I think the main thing will be keeping some kind of player investment in the scenes when there's the whole Infection mechanics.  I'm going to downplay their importance.  If they're doing well in their scenes and still feel like they're "losing" because of the manoeuvres, well, it'll be over real quick.  So if we treat that as a timing mechanism (as suggested) I think it'll be OK.<br/><br/>I'm torn as to where to start things.  Initially, I was set on starting with Infection.  Because it seems to be the default.  But it seemed like there wouldn't be much going on, so I tried to make the situation kinda messy for the players even without any Vaylen.  I figured the Iron Empires are full of rivalries and conflict regardless, so that ought to make for great gameplay even while there's very little worm slaying.  The players also seemed really into the characters and conflicts we'd created.  Adding the worms to that seems... premature.<br/><br/>Then I read that article and thought, maybe I should start with Usurption.  I dunno at the moment.  It's going to be a while before we start: The next couple of sessions will be character burning, Firefight, DoW and whatnot as we try to wrap our heads around the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101378/#Comment_101378" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T21:50:06+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  9:50PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Atmosphere:<br/>\nFor whatever reason, everyone seemed very psyched by the idea of a Partially Life Supporting world.
