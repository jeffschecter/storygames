For more info I need to read  the book, but regarding art and layout, it's a first class product \xe2\u20ac\u201c in fact, the print quality of Lulu is only barely adequate for graphics, but the fonts are thick enough to not turn into spiked things that kill my eyes.<br/><br/>Now, I need to read this so I can tell you why you want to play the game.

I know Greg's got his own thing, and probably never looked at this stuff, but it feels a lot like The Riddle of Steel and TSOY, so's if you like those, you will seriously like Reign.<br/><br/>You should note that it has a few places in it where Greg decided for some reason to use GNS terminology, and it's not only annoying, but it's used so ridiculously wrong that it will either make you laugh or grit your teeth. It made me laugh. This is only about two or three times in the book, though. My honest opinion on its applicability to story gaming is that the sort of things I see people look for - reward systems that tie into hard choices, increased effectiveness in emotionally important situations - is light. The increased effectiveness is there, but unlike TROS, where it could be 50% or more of your score, it's an edge in Reign. Bumping that up will increase emo potential.<br/><br/>Played as written, I think Reign will have a little something for just about everyone at the table. It's definitely written in that style: it's got a lot of optional combat rules, and lots of places to hang emotional drama on, although they may need to be extended to have a full-on hippie-dippie experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74004/#Comment_74004" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T12:05:21+00:00" title="June  6, 2007 12:05PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton, this sounds awesome.

Obviously a lot of thought has been spent on this. It seems to be quite compact with the different ways to roll, set, and count dice for results. From a game estate view, that's fine: A lot of information from a small set of data points. On the other hand, you'd probably need a bit acquaintance with the system to get all it's intricacies.<br/><br/>Character generation is a mix of all the fun parts of character generation I can think of: Choice between point buy and rolling the dice, with a bit of life path stuff rolled into the latter.<br/><br/>The part about Uldholm is one of my favorite setting descriptions, right up to Near (which isn't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison).<br/><br/>As was already said, the print quality is not good enough to do the artwork service, but that's one of the downs of PoD.

Normally I'd address this on the rpg.net thread where the criticism was most frequent, but they seem to be down at the moment.<br/><br/>My stance on the issue is that their printing quality can only improve if we demand more from it. Reign called for a very rich treatment so I didn't let fear of printing quality keep me from doing that. (Well, fear and rookie bravado.) There is wisdom in staying within the technical boundaries of the intended medium, but I have faith that it is well within Lulu's capacity to produce some excellent products. Just look at the binding, the sturdiness of the cover and the rich colors as evidence of that much.<br/><br/>That's not to say I'm not going to compromise. Reign is a lot of my personal firsts (first fantasy book, first <b>BIG</b> book, first hardcover book, among others), so it was a great learning experience for me. The past few weeks, I've designed a couple InDesign templates that <i>do</i> take into account previously evident problems, namely the inconsistent bleeds along the edges of the pages. Still, I'm not letting that restrain the rest of the design. I appreciate everyone's comments about Lulu's printing quality, but I would ask each of you to email them directly and express these concerns. Squeaky wheel gets the grease, after all.<br/><br/>Am I more forgiving of the printing quality because I'm still giddy as a schoolgirl about having my work published in a bigass book? Hell yeah, anyone would be. I feel very fortunate to have a company like Lulu around to give independent publishers a chance to see their work in paper.<br/><br/>I'm just sayin'... ease up on Lulu a little bit, give 'em direct, constructive critique and show your appreciation for high-end graphics by buying at least five copies of Reign. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><i>x-posted on my LJ</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74671/#Comment_74671" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-09T12:21:16+00:00" title="June  9, 2007 12:21PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good plan, and would be even better if Lulu were quick to respond to customer requests and feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74692/#Comment_74692" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-09T14:17:56+00:00" title="June  9, 2007  2:17PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do I take some of these comments to mean that REIGN softcovers are now flowing like Spice?

I'm just some dude. Speaking as some dude, I'm okay with Lulu's print quality considering the costs that Greg would've had to incur going through more traditional publishing routes. Still, the only way the print quality will improve is if Lulu knows that other people are <i>dis</i>satisfied with it. I'm not dissatisfied, so I'm not complaining.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is a better strategy for the potential buyer to withhold their purchase until Lulu can promise an even higher quality of printing, and to tell Lulu they're doing so. But me, I wanna get the game in my grubby little hands and roll some dice.

From the go, it's charging to take position with my Top 3 favorite games. It's a massive amount of gaming material \xe2\u20ac\u201d as I wrote before, the gorgeous artwork is a good counter point to that.<br/><br/>My initial impression of a tight core mechanic that is the foundation of all parts of the system has been confirmed so far. The rules are presented in a concise and colloquial style, along with design decisions and tips for various play styles; the target group obviously are experienced gamers. A smattering of various sub systems \xe2\u20ac\u201c esoteric disciplines for the non-magical, sorcery for the magical \xe2\u20ac\u201c offer enough room for a lot of interesting, specialized, and able characters.<br/><br/>Also, the setting has a good mix of general information about the four major nations, as well as some minor ones. There is enough flexibility to allow a group to either take over one of the existing empires, or to start out with one of the grey/white spots on the map called "Mud Duchies". I won't give away too much about the peculiarities of Heluso and Milonda's geography, but I think it is a refreshing take that adds on to the fantastic feel. Every nation's description concludes with a short but intriguing list of character and company concepts, as well as "Plot Complications", which I'd call plot hooks to kick off a game with.<br/><br/>The flavor texts convey numerous details about the world without bogging down the main text. That way, varying historical and detailed depth have their place, adding to the mix. <br/><br/>I already gave my part in the ransom for the first supplement, which is having some strong spin already.
