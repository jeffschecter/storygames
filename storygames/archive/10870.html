He likens the face-to-face experience to entering an instance and largely handles story/character stuff in email.  I'd explain more but he does a good job of it himself.<br/><br/>Has anyone tried this kind of thing out for themselves?  How did it work or not work?  Who'd be willing to try something like it in their game, or is this too far outside the scope and purpose of story gaming?<br/><br/>Thanks for your thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241044/#Comment_241044" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T08:50:13+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  8:50AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this has been beaten to death in the past but if it was I wan't in on the conversation so I'll give it a go.<br/><br/>If the face to face crunch that people like is a tactical wargame I can definitely see handling story telling elements separately. <br/><br/>Running story via text has certainly been done for years (decades even) There are lots of technics for doing it. <br/><br/>Round Robin: One person writes a scene and then passes the text on to other players. There is coauthorship but not a lot of interaction and will fall apart fast if players aren't real cooperative and friendly.<br/><br/>List/Forun Free for All: One person posts to a forum and then another player jumps in and then another and another. This can go real fast while people agree but falls apart when people start conflicting. It's important to realize that conflict means a lot more than just fighting.<br/><br/>GM Moderated: Everyone sends in text to a GM who then synthisizes it into a single text. This burns out GMs FAST. <br/><br/>Engle Matrix Game: Players submit scenes to a GM who decides how likely they are to happen (setting a roll). Other players may jump in with counter-arguments (also judged by the GM/referee). A die roll settles which action happens. This handles conflict well and doesn't burn out referees because they don't do any of the writing - all they do is copy and paste.<br/><br/>I've done most of these methods and prefer the Matrix Game. You can handle all manner of situation with it with very few rules.<br/><br/>The MG rules are available fro free on my web page <a href="http://www.hamsterpress.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.hamsterpress.net</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241045/#Comment_241045" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T08:50:48+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  8:50AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2009 8:52AM by MatrixGamer.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://hamsterpress.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hamsterpress.net</a><br/><br/>Hummm... how do I get this link to work? <br/><br/>Anyway - Google Engle Matrix Game and you'll find the page and can get the rules.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241046/#Comment_241046" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T08:51:04+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  8:51AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453" rel="nofollow">Space Alert</a> (an excellent board game, I highly recommend it) you play out a scene separately from the scenes resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go back and forth screaming who is going to what part of the ship, who is distributing power, who is manning the shields, who is firing the weapons, who is repairing the ship all simultaneously with a 4-7 minute time limit as a CD plays telling us who is attacking us, when, when its safe to communicate, when communications are down... all in real time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we we decide what we are going to do (and you play cards so you remember what it is you did) you go back and resolve everything to find out the end result.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot the same as what Gabe is doing with D&amp;D; but a useful point of reference and a fun game in itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241047/#Comment_241047" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T08:52:07+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  8:52AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done this sort of thing on D&amp;D and the like.

This is an interesting methodology.<br><br><b><i>BUT</i></b>, to the topic: I'm very well meaning and have wanted to do this in the past, basically supplement weekly game sessions with a few email-based RP challenges and the like, but in practice as soon as I walk away from the table my brain locks up and I forget to do it until like the day before the next session, where it doesn't matter anymore. <br><br>Back when I worked boring desk jobs in IT with more free time, I'd do stuff like this from my desk. Now it seems that i have far less "goof off time" at work at my newest job/employer (because my ob is actually exciting and interesing. Dammit.) which is when I traditionally did that stuff, Back at EDS, I would do like 1 hour of work a day, tops (that's all there was to do, I tried!) and the rest would be gaming related: game design, chatting on the Forge or RPGNet, getting campaigns together, or emailing these types of inter-game-session RP challenges (although I handled the results differently).<br><br>Anyway, for me, this sort of "emails between sessions", especially for campaign games, is:<br/><br/>* Something I love to do, but<br/>* My ability/interest in doing so is inversely proportionate to my business at work<br/><br/>...and my job's been crazy (but fun) for years now.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241065/#Comment_241065" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T10:00:49+00:00" title="November  9, 2009 10:00AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This kind of reminds me of The Old Days, when we used to play Battletech one night and Mechwarrior on another.

I will occasionally request more directed posts or updates on status (usually 'between dungeons'), but one of the best things about the particular format is that the players who are really invested in doing a lot of this kind of backstory and character work can do a bunch of it, while those less interested (or simply just pressed for time) needn't participate as heavily (or much at all if that's their wish) without feeling like they're missing crucial information or setting back their characters by not writing me a novella every couple of weeks.<br/><br/>Modest rewards for the players who participate without penalizing those who don't seems to have produced a nice body of work that both invests the players in their PCs (and the gestalt world) and makes my job much, much easier in terms of developing content (or tweaking pre-generated content) for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241197/#Comment_241197" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T07:06:39+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  7:06AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: snej</cite><i>"hybridizing his D&amp;D sessions such that roleplaying and mechanics-heavy stuff are handled separately.

If players are all trying to get "what their character says" worked into each scene it gets muddled and confused. When narration control is won by a single player (with suggestions from the peanut gallery) it is a lot cleaner. In a text game narration is almost by definition held by one player who writes the whole scene (rather than playing through it). I think this can be less dramatic and less story now but it certainly works.<br/><br/>I do a lot more text gaming on line than face to face gaming because I just lack time for face to face games. The Matrix Games give me enough fun though so I'm not complaining. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241228/#Comment_241228" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T09:46:13+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  9:46AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all, I created a thread on the actual technique itself.
