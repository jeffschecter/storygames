I think it's an awesome game myself, but my bent when it comes to fantasy is gritty horrific fantasy rather than tongue in cheek or even campy fantasy.  It's well designed enough that it's pretty transparent as to what to change to hack-the-hack into something else.  Before I do that though, I want to play the actual game first.  Even though non-serious fantasy isn't my thing, I know playing it will be fun anyway.<br/><br/>Ryan Stoughton, if you Play Now! with this game, count me in (assuming I'm free when you do so).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124636/#Comment_124636" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T13:24:02+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  1:24PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124642/#Comment_124642" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T13:42:01+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  1:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2008 1:55PM by Sean ov Newcastle !.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah, it's this thing....<br/><br/>.....and the reason this Battlelords of the 23rd Century player is wandering around Storygames like a bewildered child                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124652/#Comment_124652" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T14:15:03+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  2:15PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn there are a lot of RBH posts.  It almost feel guilty posting about my game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>All I will say is that we played at Dreamation and it was a blast.  It's light and has some distinct coolness going on.  With a little fiddling we worked out an entire adventure in a convention slot and were rolling on the floor for a good part of it.  RBH brings the fun!<br/><br/>An example: Steve is playing a Count without a county and has this really cool warhorse.  Steve notes that whenever they have to leave the horse behind he tells it to wait and if he's not back in time to wander off and head home or find them  Invariably the horse, he says, finds it way to where they are.  Our own illustrious Mel White is playing a snake and decides that he has been wandering in two paths for a while.  The others don't know his double exists yet. After a short while he declares that since the group has been wandering together his double has been leading the horse to where the party needs it completely ignorant of his presence.  So the players see what's going on but the character all think this horse is the coolest and smartest beast in the land completely perpetuated by Mel's double!  Gosh, and that was just the casual table-talk.<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124688/#Comment_124688" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T19:22:26+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  7:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Great story, Don.
