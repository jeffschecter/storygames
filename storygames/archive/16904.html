Other publishers followed, but none from Mexico (not sure about other spanish-speaking countries). Thus, is much, MUCH cheaper to import english titles from USA than translated versions from Spain. In fact, I've asked Devir USA for the translated 4e Red Box and they can't deliver -- this tells volumes as <a href="http://www.devir.es/producto/dungeons-dragons-4" rel="nofollow">Devir Spain</a> is the company in charge of publishing D&amp;D material in spanish.<br/><br/>Also, this means that potential players, or GMs at least, need to be capable english language readers.\n<blockquote>How much of D&amp;D and WoD is available in official Spanish translations?</blockquote>\nQuite.

But I'm not sure about fan translations. Maybe someone else could chime in.<br/><br/>The spaniard market is frankly buoyant compared to the mexican one. Spain has a number of companies translating and publishing top seller games (Devir, La Factor\xeda and <a href="http://www.edgeent.com/v2/edge_colecciones.asp?eidc=13" rel="nofollow">Edge Entertainment</a>) and some others doing their own thing (<a href="http://www.ludotecnia.es" rel="nofollow">Ludotecnia</a>, <a href="http://www.nosolorol.com" rel="nofollow">No Solo Rol</a> and <a href="http://www.holocubierta.com" rel="nofollow">Holocubierta</a>), but all this production has really minimal effect on the mexican scene.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385298/#Comment_385298" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-17T13:51:21+00:00" title="July 17, 2012  1:51PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating.

I guess the situation is pretty sad compared to elsewhere.<br/><br/>The size and activity of the scene is really hard to gauge, here's some simple data, heavily coloured by my personal network and subjective observations.<br/><br/>Internet:<br/>There is one big tabletop gaming forum but it's 99% Warhammer, the last time I checked, the only posts in the roleplaying section were about two years old<br/>I tried launching a forum once that would cover not only Slovenia but the whole region (including Austria, Croatia etc.) it was a failed experiment to say the least<br/>I am currently running a Slovenian tabletop group on Facebook and it has 50 members. It's hard to say how many of those are also roleplayers but about half of them would be a safe bet I think. I know there are more people out there that play RPGs, but they're either not on facebook or otherwise hard to find since there is no network for this kind of stuff - I'm trying to remedy that.<br/>The Slovenian roleplayers I know tend to hang either on this huge videogame forum which has a subsection for tabletop games (which is pretty much defunct last I checked) or 4chan's /tg/. I think some of them are on RPGnet, but I'm not certain.<br/><br/>A Slovenian guy was one of the winners of this year's One Page Dungeon contest! The dungeon is "Deep in the Purple Worm". I've tried to contact him through secondary channels but didn't get a response.<br/><br/>Stores &amp; Physical Spaces:<br/>I know of exactly two gaming stores in the whole country (2 mio. people).<br/>One is in the capital, and most visitors play Warhammer and MtG. If I had to hazard a guess, I would say there are about 30 more or less regular visitors connected to RPGs, mostly not overlapping with the facebook group mentioned above. That number could be way off however.<br/>There are two boardgame clubs in the capital and they seem to be doing pretty well. I know there are at least a few more around the country. The problem is that it's basically impossible to find a space for free, which means that their membership fee is relatively steep,<br/><br/>Games:<br/>Of the people I know and talk to, I'm the only one who is actively into "indie RPGs". Here and there people recognize names like Mouse Guard or Burning Wheel and someone surprised me by knowing about Technoir the other day. I know of at least one group who used to play FUDGE regularly. The vast vast majority of people I talk to seem to be playing pretty much exclusively Pathfinder/D&amp;D, with some World of Darkness games (again, almost exclusively Vampire) and games from the Warhammer 40k rpg line.<br/>A few months ago I introduced six people to Apocalypse World (three had started roleplaying recently and only played 4E, two have never roleplayed before and one is an "old hand" with lots of D&amp;D and Vampire under his belt - the later does not really enjoy the game, the others are having a load of fun, one of them has taken the game to start a new group with three or four people I do not know, which is great.<br/><br/>Translations:<br/>We have quite a few translations of popular boardgames, like Settlers of Catan, but no translations of RPGs at all (small market, small language, lack of groundwork/terminology). Me and my friends have in-jokes where we sometimes translate terms from D&amp;D into Slovene - it sounds really silly for some reason (not that D&amp;D is serious in the first place). An interesting artifact of this is that a lot of roleplaying is actually done in English. This seems to be a shared trait among many Slovene groups that I've observed. We often switch back and forth between languages as we switch between in-character and OOC (typically, when someone starts talking in English, it indicates IC). Most technical, systemic and mechanical terms are kept in English during the conversation at the table, too (Initiative, Damage, Skill...). The same goes for obscure or historical names for objects and weapons that have no real counterpart in our language (for example: we basically have only one common word that covers maces, morningstars and flails).<br/>Since translating stuff from English and vice-versa is what I do for a living (only part time for now), this is something I'd possibly like to tackle some day, but see below...<br/><br/>Produced locally:<br/>Absolutely nothing that I know of. I mean, I'm 100% certain that lots of groups have their own houserules and hacks and homebrews but I've never seen anything shared or published to any greater extent (even the Purple Worm guy I had to learn about through OPD). It's all very insular (very like the USian scene in the 90's is my impression, not sure if that impression is correct). When Sagas goes to crowdfounding in a month or so it will be the first RPG produced/published in Slovenia to my knowledge (albeit not in Slovene). There are no companies that would be willing to publish a RPG here, either original and translated. There is only one bigger company that translates boardgames but when I wrote them some time ago they never replied and now they seem to have gone out of business (most of their translations of popular boardgames are out of print).<br/><br/><br/><br/>In summary, I would say that quite a lot of people play boardgames, MtG used to be huge years ago and is still doing well, roleplaying seems to be a niche within a niche within a niche. It's impossible to say how many people play, because the majority of play seems to be private and isolated (every now an then someone will surprise me by revealing that they play or have played D&amp;D, but their group was never "public knowledge" so to speak). I'm slowly trying to change that by slowly building a network through facebook and personal channels to make thinks more connected and transparent and communicative - at the same time it's hard to say if other people are doing the same or what percentage of people I'm actually reaching out to with this. Kinda like trying to find a black cat in a dark room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385484/#Comment_385484" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-20T09:07:43+00:00" title="July 20, 2012  9:07AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2012 9:18AM by Khimus.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\xb4m from <b>Argentina</b>, I live in <b>Mar del Plata</b>, specifically. Here (in MdP), there are many RPers, but no club to gather them, so they\xb4re spread and don\xb4t get to know much each other. There\xb4s a NGO called "frikis MDP" that gathers anime-fans, gamers, gothics, tabletop-gamers and all kinds of people, and they organise stuff like zombie-walks or partys. They used to have a playroom for card games, board games and RPGs, but in 2011, not this year. Anyway, the "playroom" group in facebook still remains, and that works fine to gather at least part of the tabletop gamers here in MdP.<br/>There is a <b>gaming forum</b>, DeRol, and through there many story games got well-known (and played) within the forum users: Burning Wheel, Mouse Guard, Apocalypse World, Marvel heroic roleplaying, etc. At DeRol, each month a game is chosen as "game of the month", and reviews are written about that game, or there\xb4s discussion, curious people ask and get answered, etc. That\xb4s proven as a great tool for RPG diffusion. There are some other minor forums, like Sociedad nocturna, Rosario Rol or Salgan al Sol (not exclusively argentinian users).<br/><b>Outside forums</b>, the games most played are the trads, of course, mainly 3.5 (not everyone knows here about pathfinder), WoD and Call of Cthulhu (and a little of warhammer, both fantasy and 40k). 4e got played, but not as much today as 3.5+PF. It\xb4s not weird to occasionally find groups playing Pendragon, Kult, Paranoia or other not-so-famous games. Also, some groups play homebrew systems.<br/>Translation: mainly Devir, La Factoria for WoD, and maybe Edge or old books you may find from Joc (now extint).<br/><b>Gaming stores:</b> there are some gaming stores, but, at least in Mar del Plata, they don\xb4t offer new or interesting products. Only 1 GM here has RPG title, and they mostly offer the stock they have from 3.5 or 4e (mostly splatbooks, no basic manuals). I don\xb4t know about GSs in other cities, but I think most roleplayers in Argentina get their games through piracy.<br/><b>Local production:</b> not much, the only game written here is Diezlados, a universal (setting-less) RPG, pretty traditional. A spanish company is producing here "Aventuras en la Marca del Este", an OD&amp;D retro-clone. When released, that game was offered in a lot of places, including gaming stores and libraries, although few have re-supplied their stock.<br/><b>Clubs and conventions: </b>not even one in Mar del Plata, but there are some in Buenos Aires, Rosario, and some other big cities. In Rosario, there is a cool indie gaming crowd, they have a club and they play stuff like BW, AW/DW, MHR, Lady Blackbird, etc. They have organised a few conventions ("Rosario juega rol" and "Rosario juega indie"), where many of those games have been run. They even offered one or two lectures (I don\xb4t know if it\xb4s the correct word, I mean "charla, exposici\xf3n") about RPG theory (big model/GNS, I think). I will ask one of them to come here and tell about the RPG scene in their city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lukc" title="Lukc"><img alt="Lukc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lukc">Lukc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388585/#Comment_388585" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T10:47:47+00:00" title="August 28, 2012 10:47AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Responding - belatedly - to Teataine's comment (I'm the guy with the Purple Worm dungeon he mentioned).<br/><br/>I've been dungeon-mastering in Slovenia for approximately 16 years. In that time the "community" as such has been pretty marginal and we've pretty much recruited players by word-of-mouth and by bringing in newbies into our group(s), one in Tolmin, one in Ljubljana. As a result there is currently a pretty enthusiastic group of about 10 players of various board games and role-playing games in Tolmin and some of them are now starting up a board-game club to bring games to the wider community.<br/><br/>The rpgs we play are mostly rules-lite, story&amp;silliness heavy, and very bloody and lethal.<br/><br/>However, I'm moving to Utrecht for an indefinite period in about 2 weeks, so we'll see how things go then!<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ... there, Teataine is now in touch!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
