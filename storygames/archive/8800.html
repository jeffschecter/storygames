We had a lot of small-scope scenes, and a lot of PC cooperation. Bill (the GM and the game's creator) thought it was the best game he'd had, but it felt lacking to me. A good game, certainly, but it didn't deliver what I'd become accustomed to from the game. We talked about it later, and I came to realize that the only tangible difference between this and other games was that there was no real inter-PC conflict.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, I realized that this was very probably the reason why most games felt like they were dialed to the proverbial 11, and this one didn't. I started thinking that maybe this was a flaw in a game I otherwise adore. But with more reflection, I realized that it's actually a good thing. <br/><br/>My friend Frank doesn't like the sort of games I do. He played in a session of my own game (Unistat) once, and really didn't enjoy it, even though the other players at the table did. When I talked to him about it later, I found out that he just didn't enjoy the same sort of confrontational, in-your-face gaming that the rest of us were jazzing on. So we came to the realization that the game isn't for him, and that's okay -- it's great for me and people who like the same sort of play I do. Connecting this story back to the Ganakagok insight, I've come to think that the ability to create two entirely different sorts of games is actually a strength of the Ganakagok system. <br/><br/>In any case, I just thought it was an interesting thing that was worth sharing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194854/#Comment_194854" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-28T07:29:12+00:00" title="February 28, 2009  7:29AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Andrew --<br/><br/>The implication of this observation is that games of Ganakagok can produce unsatisfying play if not everyone is on board with respect to the desired style: if some people want homely tales of the end of innocence while others want gung-ho epic adventure to tame the sun, <i>someone</i> is not going to get what they want. Right now the rules hang a lot of weight on the GM's intro the game (you know: "Ganakagok is the name of the giant island of ice upon which the Nitu people honor their Ancestors and revere the Stars...") to set the tone and genre expectations for the play session, albeit in an implicit rather than explicit way. And I know that Alexander Newman sets some explicit expectations prior to play: no wooden ships, no quasi-European interlopers. We might add: no spaceships.<br/><br/>Of course, the cards have a powerful impact on shaping play in the sense that the images and motifs on them drive the narrative in particular directions; I remember Don Corcoran saying that he had a tough time getting over-the-top wuxia action with his "Crouching Polar Bear, Hidden Orca" version of Ganakagok because the imagery on the cards evoked a more prosaic setting. Also, since the game is sui generis, people don't usually come to the table with a lot of preconceptions about "what the story should be like" -- ironically, you may be the exception to this, since you've played the game so much. So there are forces acting to bring people onto the same page thematically. Do you think more should be done to give players and GM tools to "enforce genre," or should we rely on the social contract? Does there need to be an explicit discussion during the world creation phase of "what we want this game to be like?" or would that be playing before we play too much?  <br/><br/>Thanks for bringing this up, and for framing it as a strength rather than a weakness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194913/#Comment_194913" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-28T23:52:22+00:00" title="February 28, 2009 11:52PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I seem to remember that during world-creation, I got some idea of what people wanted by seeing how they interpreted the cards drawn.  If the act of interpreting a card or adding something to the map was supplemented by some sort of formal signalling, that might aid communication and keep any "how do we want to play?" discussion focused and brief.<br/><br/>By formal signalling, I mean something like declaring "epic" or "intimate" when you interpret a card or add to the map.  (Dunno if those two are actually ideal options or not.)  This would get people thinking about "How am I going to play with that?" in a slightly more specific way than they currently do, and could illuminate potential clashes.  You could then instruct, "If you see a clash, then discuss."<br/><br/>That's just an example; I'm sure you can identify other Ganakagok-relevant spectrums of style, and other ways to make players note the spectrum, pick a spot on it, and signal that to each other.  I'll happily help brainstorm if you do pursue something in that direction and want input...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194968/#Comment_194968" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T20:33:34+00:00" title="March  1, 2009  8:33PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, here's the thing. You can have unsatisfying play in any game, if everyone isn't on board and looking for the same thing (or at least compatible things). I mean, I've had Dogs in the Vineyard games where demons weren't real, they were more abstract things like bad luck. I've also had games where Dogs were shooting lightning from their guns and pistol-whipping demons back into the earth, then sealing the rift with blood. If we have a game where some players want the first, and other players want the second, we're going to have some unsatisfied players. I think it just comes down to communication at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
