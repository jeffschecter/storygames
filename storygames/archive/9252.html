There were extended rests after the "boss fights" in the first adventure they've just finished (single tough encounter), and an extended rest after three encounters that seemed "simple", but by the third the party almost got cleaned up because they were healing surge reduced, and had none of their dailies left.<br/><br/>Treatment of hit points, etc: we try to treat all these gauges as they appear in the rules; the only exception is that we'd only recently been put in a position where we realized we were treating Death Saves incorrectly (you're only to fail three Death Saves in an encounter before you die, no matter what happens in between them: we had one fight where one PC spent time hopping up and down around death, and although in our case the Death Save rule didn't cause a problem, but it could have).<br/><br/>Action point flow seems not to be working all that much for our group, meaning that, ideally the PCs should be trying to time things so that they take extended rests after only odd-numbered encounters (i.e. don't rest after encounter two, push on for one more encounter and then rest). But the fact that we only play for 120-150 minutes per session probably affects that somewhat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204775/#Comment_204775" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T11:33:08+00:00" title="May  1, 2009 11:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2009 11:34AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my game, the players are playing a detective unit of the city watch in a cosmopolitan port city.<br/><br/>-How many people are playing?<br/><br/>Four PCs.<br/><br/>-What level are your combat encounters? Same level as the party? Lower? Higher?<br/><br/>The party just hit level 2 last night, so they've been L1 or L2 encounters.<br/><br/>-How long do the encounters last?<br/><br/>Between 60 &amp; 90 minutes.<br/><br/>-When do you take extended rests?<br/><br/>So far, they've been taken between sessions, due to the story pacing.  That'll change, though.  I'm okay with this right now -- it gets them used to seeing what they can do with action points, and most the players are new to 4E.<br/><br/>-Do you treat hit points, healing surges, action points, and milestones differently?<br/><br/>Nope, but the closest thing the group has to a healer is a Bard.<br/><br/>What I did do last encounter was make a bargain with them.  They could have the 500 gold they got by clearing this one part of a human gang's hideout, but if they pressed on to the next section without even a short rest, they would be able to claim more.  If they didn't, then the other force would take that part of the hideout and they would only get the 500G.  They played out the decision and pushed on. So, I'm playing with what an encounter is, because of the format we're restrained to due to time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204776/#Comment_204776" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T11:39:36+00:00" title="May  1, 2009 11:39AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The one game that I am currently DM-ing doesn't QUITE fit that model, as we do longer sessions less frequently, but the usual pattern is similar.<br/><br/>4-6 players + DM<br/><br/>Encounter Builder, typically running between PL-1 and PL+1 for most encounters, PL+2 or 3 for "boss fights."<br/><br/>Usually a ratio of about 3 combat encounters to 1 non-combat encounter (skill challenge or problem-solving/exploration scene), with BRIEF just-talking scenes here and there in between.<br/><br/>Extended Rests are typically a "fade to black", but also serve as an opportunity for inter-PC banter, plot development, etc from time to time - I'll usually ask "anybody have anything they'd like to play out during the rest?" unless we're tight for time.<br/><br/>Action Points are by-the-book, as are surges, etc.<br/><br/>Encounters are all over the place in terms of length. Usually I try to go with about a 3-1 ratio of PL or lower encounters for each tough one. A standard or easy encounter typically runs 30-60 minutes, more toward the lower end of that scale. Hard or Boss encounters can take up around 90 minutes. I'll typically have monsters start to flee or surrender once things start to go south for them badly, or simply cut to "I think you guys won. Want to burn a surge and call it a win?" if I sense restlessness.<br/><br/>Naturally, everything takes a bit longer when we have a full table than when only 4 people show up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204798/#Comment_204798" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T14:09:12+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  2:09PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2009 2:10PM by nemomeme.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of my sessions had one combat.
