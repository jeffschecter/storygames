                    Quick background:<br/>I'm working on Boulevard. If I choose to publish it, then: I'm publishing it in a boxed-game format. It'll have dice, paper, pencils, a rules booklet, props... Everything presented in a game-components kind of way, instead of a tome o' rules.<br/><br/><br/>So, I'm entering NanoWrimo (www.nanowrimo.org) as I mentioned in another thread. It's a writing competition that spans November.<br/>I've begun planning the piece I'm going to write:<br/><br/>Orderfukt.<br/>A near-future depiction of American capitalism spun out of control. Some time in the next forty/fifty years, an Anarchist party gains widespread support.<br/>The idea of dissembling the corporate/military power structures, and then reverting back to natural law... It starts to actually make sense.<br/>The Anarchist Party seizes several seats, and starts encouraging citizens to "embrace failure".<br/>Quit their jobs. Hammer the welfare system. Start attacking corporations - hijacking Doritos trucks.<br/>Fuck the system up, right good and proper.<br/><br/>The American government realizes too late that this is a serious problem. The Anarchist Party poses an ultimatum: "Make the following changes, and the Anarchist Party will disband. Not only that, but our revolution will lose steam and stabilize. Don't make the follow changes, and we will consume you and terminate you."<br/><br/>This political escalation and violent acceleration forms the backdrop for a few disjointed stories - which all have the recurring theme of: Embrace failure, or you will lose the war for success.<br/><br/>Really uplifting, inspiring stuff. I'm a cheery guy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyways, here's the deal: Orderfukt doesn't really tie into Boulevard enough to have sections used as flavour text in the book...<br/>But since I'm doing a boxed set anyways.. How cool would it be to include Orderfukt as a seperate book, within the Boulevard box.<br/>It will likely read like an acid-induced dream of a Boulevard character, so it would TOTALLY be cool to include it in the box.<br/><br/>Publish it as a cheap chapbook, maybe with a cover illustration, or maybe just a zine-y cover.<br/>Throw it in the box.<br/><br/>What do you guys think? Would it be worth the increased box price?<br/>Would you be interested in getting a novella/novel with your RPG? (this will have a fairly high price point anyways, because I'm packaging it in a boardgame-box kind of format.)                </div>

                            I've said this before---one of the reasons I released "Kwaidan" was to see how well using fiction as game supplement worked. The jury's still out. It's still too early for me to say if and how well it worked. Your idea is cool, but I don't know if adding the fiction will actually help the game or not, particularly in lieu of a higher price tag.                        </div>

                            Tim - Good point.<br/><br/>My thinking - If I create this piece and it turns out like I envision it, and I'm happy with it... It'd be a perfect thematic fit with Boulevard. I'm planning to try and (somehow) market this game to creative writing groups... And maybe an isolated work of fiction like Orderfukt would be cool to include.<br/><br/>The only thing is it'd bump the cost of the boxed game up. Not by too much, but by some.                        </div>

                            Um...White Wolf used fiction as game supplements basically through the whole latter life of the oWoD. I would guess it worked pretty good, since they were highly popular?<br/>
<br/>
I know White Wolf is considered the bad apple of story games, but...the road's been cleared for you?                        </div>

<p><a href="http://glyphpress.com/shock/" rel="nofollow">Shock:</a> has an extended short story in its pages. It demonstrates features of the game and is fun to read, thanks to Ben's really entertaining writing.</p>
<p>I know it's sold at least one copy with the story alone. Probably more. In fact, now that I think about it, I'm going to put an exerpt on the Shock: page. It'll probably sell even more.</p>
