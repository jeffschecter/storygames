Sometimes players in our group will clearly be thinking three or four steps ahead for their character, and they're very much in the right mood to chomp down on an attractive hook.  When someone's in that zone, you can absolutely tap them for details and they'll happily oblige.  Sometimes they don't even wait to be asked, they'll just give you all the material you could ever possibly want without waiting to be asked for it.<br><br>When I've seen it fail catastrophically, it's because the players were very much not in the right mood for it, or the fisherman went about asking very clumsily.  (To clarify my perspective here, I'd consider every single one of the examples given in the codex as ranging from merely clumsy to downright hamfisted.)  Nearly all of our players can easily be lured onto the spot and they will definitely seize the spot when they want it without any prompting at all, but if you try and just PUT THEM on the spot the way those examples suggest, you will fail and you'll fuck up their fun very badly.  And probably sabotage the overall pacing and rhythm of the game, too.  That's just how it is for us.<br/><br/><br/>Catastrophic failures aren't very common at this point, thankfully; we've been playing together for a while now and everyone's gotten very good at being able to "read the room."  Obviously not a practical solution for the con-attending crowd, but for a local group of friends it's perfect.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166416/#Comment_166416" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T03:54:47+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  3:54AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So how would you handle prompts like those AfT?

As a player, the only time I thought that it went too far was when the GM basically asked every single player a fishing-style question in rapid succession, each player being asked in about a minute total. From that point on, fishing didn't happen for a long time, but... I dunno, it was kinda like the GM pulled away the game too much and revealed the rusty machinery underneath.<br/><br/>That's why I think it's like salt: Too much at once, and it spoils the meal a little.  But used sparingly (I try not to "fish" more than one player per session, maybe twice per player if its spread out over a long period of time, and really makes sense for what's happening) it's always improved the game. I can't think of a time where fishing resulted in crap, or ideas that I couldn't (as GM) work with, or things that derailed the game.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166511/#Comment_166511" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T17:42:50+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  5:42PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I'm not really sure how I'd handle those prompts.  The question doesn't really even make sense to me from where I'm at.<br/><br/>These days, we mostly just leave space for a player who's in the zone to come up with stuff, and see what details come out of that instead of pointing a finger at them and demanding a specific detail.  Left to our own devices, our group will generate plenty of the kinds of details that fishing is meant to elicit, and all the GM has to do is listen for them.  Sometimes a GM takes advantage of the fact that everyone's friends outside the game and finds casual ways to ask for a specific that doesn't shut them down the way "What is the mural, and why does it disturb you?" would.  For example, a GM in our group might just say "you see a mural that disturbs you," with very few or even no details beyond that...then at some point later in the game the player's character will be talking with another PC, and lo and behold, a full description of that mural's contents and why it was so disturbing will come out of their mouth, where an overt demand for details RIGHT NOW wouldn't have worked nearly half as well.  You just leave something blank when you know the player's going to fill it in for you.<br/><br/>And some of it is night fishing -- kibbitzing about the game between sessions, where the switch from playing the character to worldbuilding isn't going to be an issue the way it would be during an actual game (our players hate doing that during a game, so we try to avoid it whenever possible).  Some of it is asking questions about what their characters think about a general situation and why (which directly appeals to our players' fondness for sticking with an in-character perspective), and then getting details out of that as a bonus.<br/><br/>I'm not necessarily running down the idea of fishing -- it's great, it's just that it cuts both ways.  When I've seen it not work, it's been because it's been used at the wrong time (for example, when the player is definitely not in the right frame of mind for that) and/or with the wrong people (for example, with players who definitely do not enjoy being asked a question that way)...with other people or at other times, no problem at all.  More to the point, our group has put years and years and years into mapping out our particular pond, so we know where the best fishing spots are and when the best time to drop in a hook is.  Maybe that's why the examples seem so awkward to me; it's throwing dynamite into the water when a simple worm would've worked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166577/#Comment_166577" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T08:04:17+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  8:04AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a game with heavy fishing that converted my wife and a friend of ours into gamers.

Whereas with a lot of long time players I find Director Stance to be difficult to get them to adopt, with her Director Stance was almost her default. I laughed intensely where in the second scene of our first game she threw me this massive curve ball by using Director Stance (my laughter was actually a little odd for her, she thought she had done something wrong, but it's just that she did something that I loved but was so difficult to get long time players to do, and she did it with zero prompting from me).<br/><br/>Although oddly it seems like her second most common stance would be Actor. Also, she plays entirely in the third person. It's wild seeing the stuff she does because she has no connection to the RPG community whatsoever (beyond, of course, me).<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and obviously fishing, is completely natural to her.
