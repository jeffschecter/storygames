[Little lesson, in a game like this, or Puppetland, a voice recorder will keep time for you <i>and</i> remind players to stay focused.]<br/><br/>It is fun!  Deliciously back-stabby in places, but we all got to boost each others' tales and give feedback without breaking character, which I really like.<br/><br/>Also!  I was telling some of my friends after the fact, and they said "I wouldn't play that by itself.  But hey, if it were 'Witness the Murder of Adama and Be Ashamed, Young Ensign' I'd be all over it."  So maybe for next month we can work out a hack.  Cylons are about to muscle in, there are traces of scrambled communications between Adama and the toasters... rumors of peace, but a hard deadline and an ill-timed murder.<br/><br/>This leads me to believe one could adapt the game for a Sengoku era excursion in seconds flat.  Which also excites me.<br/><br/>And just today, when I was planning New Year's Eve, I thought about how to work this into the festivities.  Because the timer is much more... important.  And the first thing that came to mind was the end of Gaiman's Sandman series.  Spoilers...<br/><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">One of the Endless is dead.  Like in the serial, perhaps it was an elaborate suicide, perhaps it was just the inevitable end, perhaps it was murder...  Find out, and discover who will replace him.  Before something deeper, something nameless takes his kindgom.</span><br/><br/>Or more generally, it could be the death of any anthropomorphic concept.  It could be used as a kind of metaphor for the end of the year, what brought about it's end, and who will champion the new one.  Else it is wiped from our memories and we musn't speak of it again.  Dream eaters!  Time bandits!  Entropy!  Safeguard the past by putting it to an end and providing a fresh step.<br/><br/>I hope other people are checking this game out, and that we see some more of these.  I wouldn't mind a yearly subscription to this kind of thing, a game a month from whoever has time to put it together.  The production quality was nice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
