Perhaps not surprising, given that Vincent wrote it for use in long campaigns.  So I'd like to ask MCs who are successfully fitting <b>one-shots</b> into 4 hours <b>with new players</b> what tips they would suggest. This thread is just for that, so please no posts about ongoing games, taking longer than 4 hours (except in discussions about what didn't work, that's fine), or the speediness of experienced players.<br/><br/>BTW, has anyone actually managed to fit the published demo "Blind Blue and Hatchet City" into 4 hours? (It has <i>40+</i> NPCs.)<br/><br/>So far the best approach I've stolen from Vincent and John Harper is 3-4 PCs, one an Operator, the other PCs the Crew, and no or few NPCs on the crew (I had none the first time, two the second). After the Hx (History) is set and the results<br/>of the Operator's Moonlighting roll are known, spin a situation with those as input and set them off into it, and cover as much as fits into the time, reincorporating like mad and barfing forth apocalyptica, and accept that it's only going to be a taste, not a full meal.<br/><br/>My Sunday game at GPNW had Operator, Angel, Brainer, Savvyhead (same as Vincent's at Gamestorm, oddly) and<br/>ended in 4 hours because that's what we had, but another hour would have been very useful.<br/>My post-GPNW game in Portland had Operator, Angel, Driver and took 5 hours.<br/><br/>I open my brain to the Forum MCstrom and seek knowledge.  Any useful suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277784/#Comment_277784" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T01:44:25+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  1:44AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2010 1:50AM by Teataine.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, most of our sessions took a little over two hours of actual play. I think either John or Vincent told me pretty much the same (or maybe it was someone else entirely, I don't remember, it's besides the point). Four hours is plenty for an AW session I think. The rules need about five minutes to explain, or less. "Here's your playbook, follow the steps to create your character. Here are the basic moves, <i>to do it, do it</i>. When you do, roll +stat and follow the instructions of the move." Anything else you can explain when it comes up in the game. You can kick off 30 minutes in, play for two, two and a half hours, leave some time for chatting and you hit the 4 hour mark.<br/><br/>I don't see why Hatchet City's 40+ NPCs feel like a problem. They don't slow the game down, at least in my experience...<br/><br/>Why did your games take 4+ hours? I mean, what happened during them? You experience clearly doesn't match mine, I wonder where they diverge.<br/><br/>Also, yes, you'll just have to accept it that it's not an one-shot game or even a very gratifying con game. Tell your players upfront "this game isn't really supposed to sing in the first session, so bear with me". And definitely use the "catching-up letters", you know the ones that end with "love and kisses, you MC". They kick the game into a situation that would only have evolved in the second and third session.<br/><br/>EDIT: The fact is, you're probably not going to <i>conclude</i> anything in one session. It's going to feel like the pilot for a larger show. Prepare to cut at some point where things have resolved to some degree but there's some hardcore <i>announcing future badness</i> on the horizon. Then again, if you set them up as a traveling gig or start in a really small holding, you can <i>Look through crosshairs</i> really hard and be finished with the town by the end of the evening, sky filled with smoke from burning tires, earth soaked in blood and end the session with the PCs walking into the sunset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277785/#Comment_277785" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T01:55:30+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  1:55AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think you just have to giver.<br/><br/>I didn't fit anything 'complete' into the 3 hour slot that I ran. The one John ran could have used another hour at least. Because games like AW and LB are open-ended there's rarely going to be a good end point for a con game. I could see it with John's game; I was going to confront Susan and Sorrow. But honestly, I was pushing hard and fast, and two of us had already played the shit out of AW. And you know, it was The Harper. <br/><br/>I think for AW the best you're going to get is "This is what AW feels and plays like. This is the hotness." Two of four of my players 'got it,' one had already played it and the other didn't really like it all that much (that could have been me though.) <br/><br/>If you had four players, including the MC, that we already super familiar with AW, you could do it four hours, I think. An aggressive four hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277790/#Comment_277790" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T03:33:35+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  3:33AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I look at Hatchet City (which, yeah, I ran in 4 hours at GPNW, to a more or less satisfying conclusion I think) is that there's there's a ton of plot hooks out there for the players to bite on whichever ones they think look tasty. Don't worry about the other ones. Like, in my game Dustwich and the waders never came up, because everyone in my group was focused on Blind-Blue's psychic machinations. But that was cool! Everyone was happy to do so, or at least seemed it. And it ended at a pretty nice point, with Blind-Blue (and the brainer) full of bullets and Ambergrease's holding in flames.<br/><br/>HX will take up a lion's share of your chargen time. Don't be afraid to look at the playbooks ahead of time, figure out baselines for everyone, and then ask the right questions to the right PCs and modify accordingly.<br/><br/>Don't forget your principles and such. Look through crosshairs, and kill off NPCs, even important ones, hypercasually. After you've used those NPCs to make PC triangles. That's money, right there.<br/><br/>I'll try to think of more advice when I'm not just on a lunch break.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277839/#Comment_277839" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T09:56:49+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  9:56AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any reason you can't design a one-shot scenario, just like you would for a D&amp;D game or something similar?<br/><br/>Hatchet City/Blind Blue is not designed to be played out in one session--the best way is to just let the players choose one element of the situation that interests them, and focus on that. <br/><br/>But, for a con game, why not design a tighter scenario?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277847/#Comment_277847" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T10:17:56+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 10:17AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure which parts of AW you're wanting to show off, so this may be a non-starter for you, but Tony Dowler's Apocalypse D&amp;D hack runs wonderfully in con sessions (I think over GPNW it was run half a dozen times between Tony and myself).

We will probably make a bunch of cool stuff and get rolling on a fun session, only to run out of time. There might not be any neat climax or conclusion." Everyone nods, yeah okay, and we're good to go.<br/><br/>Character creation should take 30 minutes, tops. I bring an idea to the table, like, "You should be a Chopper and his gang, an Operator and her crew, a Hocus and his cult, something like that." Everyone is cool with me leading them that way. Kind of like a PTA producer bringing a kernel idea for the show.<br/><br/>While they're looking at the character types, I start drawing a map and talking about an idea for the world. "There are three holdings, each manufacturing some resource. Fuel, food, and clean water, let's say. They trade with each other by sending cargo rigs across the burn flats here..." And I ask some questions about the holdings and features of the landscape. "What kind of vehicles do you have? Hover skimmers? Big trucks? Aircraft? Roarke runs the Sanctuary holding. What's your history with him?" etc.<br/><br/>I usually ask a gig-related question or two, even if they don't have an Operator. Then I give the defacto leader <i>moonlighting</i> and a couple gigs + obligation and we roll it prior to starting the session. "This is to set up the opening action," I tell them.<br/><br/>Then we're off. I try not to explain the rules hardly at all at the beginning. It's way, way easier to address them in the moment when it's time to roll for the first time. A lot of rules talk without context at the beginning just kills the momentum (but that's true of any game, I find).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277877/#Comment_277877" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T12:13:26+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 12:13PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I be an unhelpful, selfish jerk for a second and request someone aim me at the pdf for the demo scenario?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277878/#Comment_277878" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T12:24:09+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 12:24PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam: <a href="http://lumpley.com/apocalypse/hatchetcity.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277879/#Comment_277879" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T12:25:38+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 12:25PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277880/#Comment_277880" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T12:29:01+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 12:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2010 12:29PM by Steve_Segedy.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Hatchet City/Blind Blue is not designed to be played out in one session</blockquote>\nActually I think that was the whole point, if I recall correctly.
