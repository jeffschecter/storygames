I can't figure out if its a joke, or a metaphorical pitch for a UI designer, or maybe they're seriously developing a game about ghostbusting and want someone to make sure it's realistic.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, I recently dug up the rules to the Ghostbusters RPG from the '80s and they were an interesting historic artifact -- supposedly it was the first game to use dice pools and pick-your-own stats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398874/#Comment_398874" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T11:05:55+00:00" title="November 27, 2012 11:05AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2012 11:06AM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a 1 month contract gig. I'm guessing it's actually more of a marketing gig for a game they have planned. Note the "not camera shy" and "social media savvy" and "travel to haunted locations" requirements. I think they want someone to make some Ghost Hunters style videos for them and help promote them.<br/><br/>Funny thing is, I know some folks who either qualify themselves or would certainly know someone who did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
