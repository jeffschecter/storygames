(I was more of the mystery cult illusionism persuasion than a railroader, being the lazy prepper I am.)<br/><br/>Note that you weren't alone in believing in that recipe: traditional-style rpg products routinely use the exact same conceits as CYOA books do. TSR particularly made a point of having explicit and rather verbose read-aloud text boxes in their adventures during the heyday of the D&amp;D middle school. And these were written by adults, presumably experts of the rpg form, technically speaking not that much less clueless than we are now, having caught up in age and experience. Makes one think - I suspect that it was a profound type of intellectual laziness that made some pretty clever people conclude that this is the way to deliver adventure content.<br/><br/>And yeah, just dropping the plot as an organizing principle works wonders here. It almost doesn't matter what you do instead, it's bound to be better. You could just alphabetize all the tropes (locations, perils, NPCs, other ideas) that go into your average trad adventure text, creating a little dictionary of sorts, and it would <i>still</i> be much more constructive for roleplaying use than a plot railroad is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475609/#Comment_475609" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-22T16:47:11+00:00" title="July 22, 2018  4:47PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             what a bad post I wrote.

The play experience with one of these text adventure games is somewhat linear, a little bit like reading a book. It is also a form of game that, just like roleplaying games, got very wrapped up in the literary plot ideals over time.<br/><br/>However, when you look at the way the earliest text adventures were written, and how the form was originally developed and conceptualized by creators, it's surprisingly not at all like a CYOA book: the advice and design theory that I've read has always been very up-front about a sort of a "setting first" structuration of the game: a text adventure consists of locations with connections to each other, and items that exist in those locations to interact with. That's the game, the plot thing is essentially a distraction in game design terms. You can't ignore the location map and how you make the item interaction interesting and pleasant for the player - not without stilting the game.<br/><br/>A strange tidbit about this: the licensed <i>Hobbit</i> text adventure game (from the early '80s?) has a random encounter with a wolf. The wolf might or might not be encountered in all sorts of places. Think about that: a game that is literally just supposed to be a rerun of the book in a video game form was nevertheless designed in a way that I can only describe as uncompromising in its dedication to being a game rather than a linear multimedia puzzle: no rail-roading with that wolf, you'll roll the dice and see what comes up. Maybe you'll have found the wolf-killing items when it comes, maybe not. In fact, it's not just the wolf: that game has a crazy amount of freedom and emergent combinations of how it might go, because most of the other NPCs are mobile as well, just like that wolf. The creator was not thinking of telling the Hobbit's story <i>at all</i> when developing this game structure.<br/><br/>Understanding the text adventure game in terms of linear plot experience and puzzle gates to be jumped through is a disappointingly narrow and static vision compared to what some of these guys were up to early on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475613/#Comment_475613" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-22T17:20:37+00:00" title="July 22, 2018  5:20PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah!
