I bought it and thought its text was in my top 5 best written game texts I've ever read. No small praise. If I was to write a game, I would reference Microscope. Also the sheer number of playtesting is impressive! <br/><br/>But\u2026 (here's the twist) almost everyone I've spoken to (all very different people) in private didn't like the game. Yet looking at Story Games, there are so many threads and so many posts praising Microscope. It makes me wonder, what's going on? <br/><br/>Maybe it's hype backlash. There is so much Story Games hype that when people played they wondered, "is that it?" And the reaction is so strongly positive on Story Games, people don't want to say anything. Or maybe Microscope is such a different kind of game that you really need to play it more than once with minimal expectations (and the hype is creating expectations) but people who don't like it haven't played it enough. I should note, no one I spoke to hated it. The dislike was mainly a mild sense of disappointment or confusion. Maybe the dislike is so mild that it isn't enough to motivate anyone to say anything. <br/><br/>What I'm reading in public is painting a different picture from what I'm being told in private. And Story Games (which I love, one of my favorite online communities) has a negative reputation with overhyping\u2026 see D&amp;D 4E a few years ago. It was "the awesome" for a few months and then many people quickly turned on it.<br/><br/>I'm personally going to play Microscope no matter what. And I suspect my now lower expectations will actually help me enjoy the game more than some of the people I've spoken to. <br/><br/>Ultimately no game is for everyone. And when I read well reasoned opinions based on actual play from people who both like or dislike something\u2026 it gives me a clear picture of who a game is for. It gives me an idea of if the game is for me. <br/><br/>Negative but fair reviews give me more information that only positive reviews. When I got to Yelp or Amazon, I always read the negative review first. If I read, "this was a good restaurant, the food was tasty if you like spicy food, and the prices reasonable but we had to wait 20 minutes to get in\u2026 1 star", then what this really tells me, if I don't care about waiting 20 minutes, the 1 star aside, this place is probably worth checking out\u2026 especially if the positive reviews are strong and the negative reviews don't really matter to me. Same thing with games, a negative review may say, "the art is terrible but the game play is excellent if you like strategy game with no random elements." Well then if the art isn't that important to me, and I like strategy with no random elements\u2026 sold! <br/><br/>But without any criticism or people disliking something to balance the outpouring of positive reviews\u2026 I really have trouble knowing if something is for me. Since no game is for everyone, only positive reviews doesn't give enough context to help you decide if something is worth paying for. And often, "just play to find out", isn't an option.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326518/#Comment_326518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T13:41:32+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  1:41PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I just wanted to add that the author, Ben Robbins... rocks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326529/#Comment_326529" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T14:37:06+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  2:37PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't like it my first go-around, and the intro text that was read to me rather pissed me off.

Our migrant canoers were rewarded for their piety and paddled to the stars at the end of time!<br/><br/>Furthermore, I think Microscope is crazy innovative and, as such, mostly unrecognizable when set against other hobby games.  Such a game will thrive in an environment where novelty and innovation are seen as virtues.  It seems like Story Games and Microscope are a good fit for each other!\n<blockquote>Yet looking at Story Games, there are so many threads and so many posts praising Microscope. It makes me wonder, what's going on?</blockquote>\nI can't speak for Story Games, but I am a very special snowflake and my reasons for liking a game or not liking a game are probably not that germane to anyone else.  Rather than really work at articulating why something doesn't work for  me, I'll just move onto another game.  I just don't feel like I owe this scene any criticism.  And I don't expect any criticism from the scene in return.  I try not to judge anything by what I've read on storygames.<br/><br/>Also: good game criticism is super hard!  If, as you say, playing a game to find out if you like it is often not possible, then playing it to review / critique seems like an even taller order.  And I believe that if someone wants to represent themselves as a game critic, they better damn well understand the game's objectives and have played it enough to understand how it fails at those objectives.  "I didn't like this game" is not a review.  "It tries to do this and fails and here is why," is a review.<br/><br/>Finally, internet discussion boards are a spectacularly poor medium for criticism for all the well-understood reasons.  If I'm sitting down for beers or coffee with friends, I'm more likely to talk up why Fiasco or 4E Gamma World or Mars Colony have fizzled for me, than I am to share it with a bunch of (relative) strangers here.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>But\u2026 (here's the twist) almost everyone I've spoken to (all very different people) in private didn't like the game.</blockquote>\nWHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN DEFIANCE OF THE MEMO?

Every time we did a scene, I thought, "yes, at last, I'm getting to play a character instead of narrating huge-scale events!" On the other hand, there were almost no Mediating Cues (i.e. the game did not "intervene" in our play to make sure cool things were happening) so play was unsatisfyingly un-limited by creative constraints (I like being tied up by constraints. It pulls me in and, well, maybe makes me feel safe ^__^ j/k)<br/><br/>It was a bit like sitting down and expecting a dungeon crawl, and getting How to Host a Dungeon. <br/>I really love the hell out of some HtHaD, BUT. It feels more like a "toy" than a game. <br/>So does Microscope. I think if there were some way to use it as such, I'd enjoy using it for that. If so, I'd skip the individual scenes unless it's important to clarify one or two important moments in the history and playing them out in the "future game" (the game we're prepping for) just wouldn't make sense. <br/><br/>I thought the other player, Ben, did a fantabulous job.

I bought a copy, printed it out, and played it at one of the South Bay Story Games Days. I enjoyed it, it was a lot of fun. I ignored (or missed) some of the advice, so our game was a little wonky, but I'm really looking forward to playing it again.<br/><br/>You have to be in a certain mindset to play the game. It's not about role playing characters; it's about role playing a history. Sometimes you play characters, sometimes you blow the piss out of your friend's utopia and get into arguments about the validity of giant space squid.<br/><br/>I like that I can play it anytime, anywhere, without any prep. If I have a several dozen index cards, I can bust out a game. Then I can take what we played and make it into a setting for virtually any other system. Neat!<br/><br/>ETA: I forgot the point of the thread and talked about why I liked Microscope instead of mentioning things I didn't like about it. I don't think the game is perfect, but I do think it's a blast.

Far from being hyped, I've thought the reception to Microscope has been eerily quiet up to this point.  I've wondered even how its sales are or how much play it's been getting outside Seattle so far.<br/><br/>I think the book is really well-written.  I think it compares with the excellent Fiasco and Mouse Guard games in the "how do you play this game" dept.  That's my primary comment on it.  But I don't think it's getting the attention it warrants for this for this quality, much less any hype.<br/><br/>I've only played it twice.  It was well-received by each of the other four players.  One of them prefered the Period and Event construction to the Scene play which was a little loose, I think, for his preferences.<br/><br/>I don't know yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if a fair number of people felt it was not really for them, especially if they don't return to it.  Microscope is easy to learn and facilitate for a first run, but it seems like a game that yields its fruit over time.  Expectations, too.  You don't play it anything like you play most of the other games around here, and if you approached it with the same general S-G toolkit, I could see it falling a little flat for some.<br/><br/>edit: I was interrupted in my read of the OP and missed that jenskot hadn't played it yet so my joke about him being the Microscope hype engine doesn't work at all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326560/#Comment_326560" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T18:19:11+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  6:19PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>It was a bit like sitting down and expecting a dungeon crawl, and getting How to Host a Dungeon.<br/></blockquote>\nI get your analogy, I'm not sure why you expected "a dungeon crawl."<br/>This makes me wonder how it was billed, if it was recommended by someone else or whatnot.

So that's why I haven't talked about it intelligently yet.  But I am super psyched to do so, once that happens!  It looks super fun!<br/><br/>Honestly, I think some private grumbling is pretty common from indie designers when a new game gets published, in my experience.  Because we all read it and either 1) decide it's not our thing (more and more common, as the games produced get more diverse) or 2) like lots of it, but would have designed it differently ourselves (hard not to think this way sometimes, as a game designer).<br/><br/>My sense, like yours, John, is that -- once convention season rolls around and everybody gets a chance to play the new games -- a lot of this goes away as people enjoy the games for what they are (or just get over it), instead of grumbling about what they're not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326565/#Comment_326565" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T18:52:23+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  6:52PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>Every time we did a scene, I thought, "yes, at last, I'm getting to play a character instead of narrating huge-scale events!"

The roleplaying scenes are not necessarily about drama; they're there to resolve ambiguities within the history.  Certainly, story and drama can arise out of that, but the game doesn't drive at it.<br/><br/>(If I have misunderstood your use of the word 'tales' then I apologize.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I know that there was a 7 person Microscope game at Camp Nerdly.

I suspect for some people, "you won't have your own character" would be something they would want to know up front:\n<blockquote>Microscope works differently than some other role-playing games you might have played, so let\u2019s abandon some preconceptions:<br/><br/>You won\u2019t have your own character.<br/><br/>You won\u2019t play the game in chronological order. You may know all about the future, but be surprised by the past.<br/><br/>You\u2019ll build the story from the outside in. You\u2019ll decide the big picture, the grand scheme of history, and then burrow down and carve out the details.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Humanity spreads to the stars and forges a galactic civilization\u2026<br/>Fledgling nations arise from the ruins of the empire\u2026<br/>An ancient line of dragon-kings dies out as magic fades from the realm\u2026 <br/><br/>These are all examples of Microscope games.<br/><br/>In Microscope, you build an epic history as you play.

Want to jump back to the childhood of the king you just saw assassinated and find out what made him such a hated ruler? That\u2019s normal in Microscope.<br/><br/>You have vast creative authority. You can make whole empires rise and fall at will. Dream up a utopia or destroy one with nuclear fire. You have that power, but remember you\u2019re not alone: everyone else at the table can do it too.<br/><br/>You create independently, but not in isolation. Each facet you add to history builds on what other players built before you. You expand on their ideas, and they expand on yours. History might not turn out the way you expected. Be prepared to think on your feet.<br/><br/>When you zoom all the way in to a particular moment in time, all the players share the stage and role-play together to find out something we want to learn about the history. Did the crew of the Icarus know the aliens were on Titan? Did the rebels really fake the government crackdown? Do the knights remember the original meaning of their ritual vows? We role-play and see. The more you play, the more your once simple summary becomes a detailed tapestry, full of meaning and surprises. History snowballs.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326580/#Comment_326580" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T19:52:11+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  7:52PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2011 7:56PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, I was loving every bit of that "What Is Microscope?" blurb until I got to "A role-playing game for two to four players."

A Microscope scene needs a question and the scene ends when that question is answered.<br/><br/>Like, if our Period were World War II and our Event was Pearl Harbor, then the scene question might be "how did the Japanese surprise the Americans so completely?"  And depending on the whims of the people at the table, the scene's characters might be a radar operator, his supervisor, and their lover -- or maybe Admiral Kimmell, President Roosevelt, and WInston Churchill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326590/#Comment_326590" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T20:37:33+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  8:37PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2011 8:39PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But any character who doesn't help answer the question is a waste of space, right?

You're not playing to know his hopes and dreams, or find out how the event affects his life, or ponder <i>if</i> he <i>might</i> be involved.

I played a bunch of Microscope in the playtest and my group posted about it here at the time, but I haven't finished reading the finished text and I know it has some important differences from the last version I played, so I've been reluctant to post about it.  I'd still recommend everyone at least try it because it's so original (and I did recommend it to Zac), but I can't really contribute to the discussion because my head is still full of legacy-version stuff that just doesn't exist any more.<br/><br/>Um.  I should also maybe mention I'm a bad judge of whether or not the play experience is unsatisfying, because I am a huge sucker for asynchronous storytelling and actually just got back from running a session of Continuum.  I thought the Microscope book was very clear in explaining how to conceive of and navigate that structure, though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326599/#Comment_326599" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T22:03:15+00:00" title="May 26, 2011 10:03PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2011 10:13PM by Andy.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya, I'll bite!\n<blockquote>I haven't played it yet. I bought it and thought its text was in my top 5 best written game texts I've ever read. No small praise.</blockquote>\nBefore I played it, I thought the same thing. After having played it, I DOUBLE think so. Jason Morningstar (who hasn't played yet) pretty much said the same thing re the text: it is an Engine that produces Understanding of the Game, mroeso than just about any RPG I've ever seen.<br/><br/>However, after having said that and played it, and talking with the group who played it, I think that claim might be true because of the reason that, while there is a lot of procedure and tips to remember, when you "make a character" or "create a Period", it's very straightforward: You don't point-buy from lists, you don't roll or assign numbers, you don't take abilities or skills that have to carefully be playtested and balanced against each other. In other words, Microscope is quite seriously one of the easiest games of its complexity that I've ever seen, and that's solely due to the author's excellent job of carefully and completely spelling out all the rules... and yet, he might have "had it easy", as it lacks a lot of the character/minutiae that other games have ("making characters, using numbers, rolling dice", etc).<br/><br/>Make sense?\n<blockquote>But\u2026 (here's the twist) almost everyone I've spoken to (all very different people) in private didn't like the game. Yet looking at Story Games, there are so many threads and so many posts praising Microscope. It makes me wonder, what's going on?</blockquote>\nPlease poll them and have them participate here or relay their comments, I'd love to hear more!<br/><br/>In truth, I kinda avoided it at first because while there was a lot of positive talk on it here, there wasn't a lot of Actual Play that I could see: Everyone seemed to be in the honeymoon phase, and while there was a lot of talk, I didn't see a lot of info from folks who I tend to listen to for opinions on new games (likely cause they were busy with other things, hadn't played/read it yet). And given the quality of the writing, it's easy to see why. Conceptually it was interesting, but the PDF broke my "no more than $10 for a PDF unless it's Epic" rule, and I had just sponsored or purchased a bunch of other stuff recently. <br/><br/>((EDIT: And below, I note that probably my real reason for waiting so long for something that should resonate with me was simply because I was waiting to see a solid, "We played it but it wasn't fun for me for These Reasons" post/blog/other. That was the main thing.))<br/><br/>I was planing on getting around to buying it eventually, but I took a chance and got it a few weeks ago: Simply put, what it says it does ("create history, play generations, go forward and back in timeline") appeals to me, and has been tried by much larger games or fan hacks, all failures (see ARIA for the greatest example) (EDIT: Save In a Wicked Age, which does similar things, and I love :-) ). So I broke down and picked it up.<br/><br/>I was, as above, blown away, but I specifically said nothing about that (save for the ease of reading/understanding) because I wanted to at least play it once to see if it worked in play as much as it did in my head. I didn't want to contribute to empty hype for something that looked pretty and fell apart in play. As I've seen that sort of thing happen a lot these days, not necessarily with the Latest Release Craze, but I've seen it nonetheless.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm very much in favor of hearing more.\n<blockquote>Maybe it's hype backlash.</blockquote>\nCould be. Is this people who bought/read/played it? Or people who heard the talk about it and judged it on that? If the former, I *really* want to hear more, and wish people would speak up on this sort of thing more. It's not like every small press game is "sponsored" here or free from "It didn't work for me" criticism. Oh well.\n<blockquote>There is so much Story Games hype that when people played they wondered, "is that it?" And the reaction is so strongly positive on Story Games, people don't want to say anything.</blockquote>\nWell, that was actually my reaction to In A Wicked Age on my first read. Then I played it, and it became one of my favorite games ever. Note that it also does something similar to what I wanted to get out of games like it and Microscope: Generational play, characters that come and go, etc. But holy hell did some parts resonate with folks: Mostly the "Oracle" bizness, but for me it was simply the generational style of play, the "We owe" list, etc. <br/><br/>So I guess what I'm kinda saying is, (like IAWA, written by a Stamped Favoured/Known Designer round these parts) parts of it clearly resonate with people, whether it does or doesn't work for them in actual play. It's totally cool if folks don't have a similar reaction to it, and it's not for them. But if we're reliving that tired old caustic bullshit of "Anything that people are enthusiastically talking about here MUST be empty hype ("...because they should be playing my game/my favorite game/my playtest/etc instead")", then that mentality can fuck off and die. I don't think that's what is happening here, but I have seen this shitty behavior rear its head from time to time, and hoping that it's actually people who saw/read the game and decided it wasn't for them (or read it and were underwhelmed), which is again as I say 100% cool IMO.<br/><br/>Continuing...\n<blockquote>Or maybe Microscope is such a different kind of game that you really need to play it more than once with minimal expectations (and the hype is creating expectations) but people who don't like it haven't played it enough. </blockquote>\nTwo things:<br/>1) It's closer to Universalis than a "Real RPG": A toolbox, or toy as VERY aptly described above by Zac (and that I'm almost fully in agreement with), where Actual Playing of Roles (the requisite for an RPG, right?) is actually just the side business, and is only one of the three major things that is happening at the table rather than the Focus Thing that is happening.\n<blockquote>I should note, no one I spoke to hated it. The dislike was mainly a mild sense of disappointment or confusion. Maybe the dislike is so mild that it isn't enough to motivate anyone to say anything.</blockquote>\nAh, ok, so it sounds like these people were reading the game then. Then that stuff I mention re anti-enthusiasm BS doesn't apply, it sounds like these people came to a sound decision, and were perhaps mis-sold it or had other expectations. Which makes me really want to hear more about what they were disappointed in, because I think there might be a lot to learn from hearing more criticism.<br/><br/>If they were promised something else, I'm really interested in what they were promised.<br/>If they were expecting something more or had high expectations, I'm really interested in what set them. <br/>Genuinely.\n<blockquote>What I'm reading in public is painting a different picture from what I'm being told in private. And Story Games (which I love, one of my favorite online communities) has a negative reputation with overhyping\u2026 see D&amp;D 4E a few years ago. It was "the awesome" for a few months and then many people quickly turned on it.</blockquote>\nAh, ok. On my first readthrough this is what set off my little mini-rant above. Sure, there's overhype (ok, maybe that's not fair, as it implies promoting a thing of no value for illicit reasons; perhaps "mistakenly high enthusiasm not based in real play experience?" a mouthful, but more accurate). To my "fuck off and die" bit above, I too was in love with 4E when it came out, it was totally fresh and hot, and promised some exciting change.<br/><br/>Cut to about a year later, after about 3 campaigns and a few hundred hours of play, and the third session in a row where "Oh crap, we were too busy in combat that we forgot to Role-play for the last four hours! Again!", and that's where my opinion crystalized and changed from super enthusiasm to "super... it's not for me". I was fighting against folks claiming that D&amp;D was a glorified board game when it came out, promising that it delivered on roleplaying as well, but again a few hundred hours later and my opinion changed. The same thing happened with a lot of people here; they moved on to other things. The process of enthusiasm, interest, play, play, play, overplay, reassessment and conclusion<b> is very real and organic</b>, and while it might look from the outside as "Suddenly the entire forum said "4E Bad!" and stopped talking about it", in truth it was basically many people in many places independently arising to similar conclusions. <br/><br/>(and hell, there's still a lot of 4e play going on with regulars here, even with filthy indie hipsters; and I still hold that after 4e, the bar for "interesting combat" was raised so high - like with the production values of Dresden Files or Mouseguard - that it really changed the scene forever: The next two campaigns after we stopped 4e had combat that basically tasted like ash, and amounted to "stand toe to toe and roll high until one guy falls over" in comparison to 4e).<br/><br/>...okay, that might have been too long of an aside, but I hope it plants a few seeds in minds that there's no "hivemind", it's basically Just People and Their Play.\n<blockquote>Ultimately no game is for everyone. And when I read well reasoned opinions based on actual play from people who both like or dislike something\u2026 it gives me a clear picture of who a game is for. It gives me an idea of if the game is for me.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely true. And made me realize that in the top of this post I noted why I waited a month to pick up a copy. This made me remember the real reason I waited so long, and it was because I too was waiting for a negative review, or at least a "Here's why this isn't for me", "Here's why we didn't like it" in order to "place" the concept of the game along a timeline. Frex, if there were more feedback like from Zac above, I likely would have checked out the game sooner. Might be me just wary/suspicious of All Positive No Negative/Reserved feedback (as I wagered that it meant that a lot of folks were reading it, but not playing yet).\n<blockquote>Negative but fair reviews give me more information that only positive reviews. When I got to Yelp or Amazon, I always read the negative review first. If I read, "this was a good restaurant, the food was tasty if you like spicy food, and the prices reasonable but we had to wait 20 minutes to get in\u2026 1 star", then what this really tells me, if I don't care about waiting 20 minutes, the 1 star aside, this place is probably worth checking out\u2026 especially if the positive reviews are strong and the negative reviews don't really matter to me. Same thing with games, a negative review may say, "the art is terrible but the game play is excellent if you like strategy game with no random elements." Well then if the art isn't that important to me, and I like strategy with no random elements\u2026 sold!</blockquote>\nAbsolutely agree. This is exactly how I research and purchase board games (or plan restaurant trips), and it's not hard to see why such information is a value add.<br/><br/>OK, that was pretty TL;DR there. <br/><br/>I ran the 7-person Nerdly game, I'll talk about that next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326600/#Comment_326600" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T22:19:21+00:00" title="May 26, 2011 10:19PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>This makes me wonder how it was billed, if it was recommended by someone else or whatnot.

To me it feels like there's some great golden city of awesome in the mountains, that's not very easy to find. The book describes the way there, and includes photos from when you're on the right path so that everyone can see how awesome it looks. When I play, I can always feel that this great place is up there, and as I've said we got there nearing the end of the session twice, but sometimes it's just a hike in the mountains. I happen to like hiking in the mountains, so that's not worse than a session of another game, but I always get this feeling of there being more in this game than what we're currently enjoying.<br/><br/>The analogy falls apart a little when I have to agree that not only are there people who dislike hiking, there are also people who look at Eldorado and says "nice, but it's not for me; I prefer Atlantis over in Apocalypse World."<br/><br/>Basically I like it and it feels like there's vast potential, but I haven't yet figured out how to tap that potential reliably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326614/#Comment_326614" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-27T01:18:35+00:00" title="May 27, 2011  1:18AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Microscope at Go Play NW 09 with Ben, when it was still in playtest, and it blew me away.

It lets them be dismissive, then step back and say, hey, I'm just being neutral. Examples include: "Is this really an RPG?", "This is illlusionism" and "Farmville is not a game".<br/><br/>It's a problem because, rather than people reporting their own experiences ("I wanted more rules"), they shift to neutral terms ("The game doesn't provide enough creative constraints"), because they're more persuasive.

This was also eh.<br/><br/>From my limited sample, I note two features that the good games shared that the mediocre ones lacked.  The first is a unified aesthetic.  Generic fantasy or sci-fi aesthetic led to generic-feeling histories.  Second, both of the successful games intersected with real-world history and literature in some way.  This gave us lots of cool material to riff with and reinterpret.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326638/#Comment_326638" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-27T07:20:44+00:00" title="May 27, 2011  7:20AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having not read the thread yet, I'll say that while there are a lot of things I liked about <i>Microscope</i>, at Camp Nerdly this year when I played it I saw a number of people creatively blocked up with no way to get out (and with a game system designed to prevent them from doing so; the Hot Seat).

I accept that as where we broke the system and where having too many people caused a problem.<br/><br/>As a complement to the rules about how you lay out cards, despite there being 7 very active players, it was easy to find and follow everything.<br/><br/>My other issues with the game that I outlined above were not impacted either way by there being 7 players in the game, in my opinion.<br/><br/>In fact, having 7 players possibly helped with the blank page problem that the game presents for me. Having more players meant you had more time to think about what you wanted to do, and more input from other players with which to generate ideas of your own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326776/#Comment_326776" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-28T13:34:18+00:00" title="May 28, 2011  1:34PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2011 1:35PM by Ry.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread convinced me to bring a Harrow Deck to the fantasy Microscope game on Wednesday.

Some of that was during playtesting, two games have been at cons. <br/><br/>Every time ranged from good to awesome. Most of the people who i've talked with about it don't self-identify as gamers, though they're imaginative and great creative collaborators. Then i played it with those same people, and they were all stoked.<br/><br/>I've mentioned to a couple of people (but not to ben yet) that i think that ben oversold it a bit in the text, like, continually telling me (the reader) that it's different from other games that have been played. Perhaps this was warranted, though, 'cause some readers may still not have understood that fact.<br/><br/>Also, in a time when there are no words for these creative activities, (what is an RPG? What is a game? What is a story game? What is story, in the context of what we create together? we have no universal terms) I don't see any reason to not call it an RPG, even if - for brevity &amp; enjoyment's sake, to play more in a limited time, i've shaved the played scenes entirely from my game. Well, once i did that. It was great! <br/><br/>An RPG without RP? Eyes may roll, but to those i say, like Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst once said, "Stick it up your yeah! Stick it up your yeah!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327060/#Comment_327060" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T11:38:24+00:00" title="May 31, 2011 11:38AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is playing Microscope like playing Doctor?<br/><br/><br/>(Because, if so, I could see that being very awkward with seven people...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327080/#Comment_327080" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T12:13:40+00:00" title="May 31, 2011 12:13PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I would think that with 7 people there's "I'm going to fail to keep the right vibe with Rob, Jim, Ted, Kate, Megh, Meag, and Meg" instead of just "I'm going to fail to keep the right vibe with Kate, Megh, Meag, and Meg"</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327116/#Comment_327116" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T14:54:40+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  2:54PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that'll probably break with seven players is scenes - in fact, we sometimes found four people to be one too many - they often focus on two main characters and one player can play Time and another can play a more supporting role ... seven would be really rough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327119/#Comment_327119" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T15:16:45+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  3:16PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I played microscope we unconsciously connived to make the game about the characters.

Sorry about the long time to post about it: Been busy at day with work, and at night with... well... Terraria. :-)<br/><br/>Here's what Mike Miller said of the experience over on his blog:\n<blockquote>Instead (of playing Puppetland), I played Microscope. We knew we were breaking the game before we started, as bringing seven players (Andy K., JACN, Rob, Seth, me, Julia, Giulianna, and Will) to a game intended for three or four is not the best choice for awesome play. But as the purpose was demo, more than play, we all accepted that and worked on the story of how the refugees from a religious war eventually rebuilt a high-tech hunter-gatherer society on their own world and reconnected with interstellar society at large. It was an interesting story. Perhaps a bit too cerebral, but we were all thinking hard about learning the rules.<br/><br/>On the whole, I was a bit underwhelmed by Microscope. Not by the fiction we created, that was cool. I was hoping for something more robust in the rules beyond structured brainstorming. While the strict guidelines on when you can collaborate and when you can\u2019t are interesting, I\u2019m not sure that they really serve to enable the group to explore material they wouldn\u2019t have, simply by sitting down at a table and talking. Still, I might buy the PDF and look it over.</blockquote>\nSo I've run kinda crazy "This is the taste of the core of the game" demos before, including Beast Hunters for something like 15 people (!!) at once back at GenCon. This was initially going to be a "four people including me to play a 'quick session'", but due to a LOT of folks interested in it, I turned it into basically a 7-person demo (an 8th watched us play towards the end) of what the critical functions of the game are. We all knew well going in that it was not a "true" play of the game, but basically a controlled demo/experiment of what it does and how it plays. No one came away from that game with a better or lesser opinion on it due to the fact that something was supposed to happen but didn't due to the size/time of the game. It was a taste, pure and simple.<br/><br/>We also went in knowing:<br/>* I had about 4 hours or less of sleep a night for the past three nights, <br/>* I had only read about 70% of the book, knew all the setup procedures well but would have to stop and read through the Scene parts to make sure we go all those (which wasn't a problem, again due to the clear writing), <br/>* That I had only read a little of the great game advice in the back,<br/>* We were limited on time, and had too many people to effectively judge the game in any real fashion other than the basics of what it provided.<br/><br/>It's hard not to compare it to Universalis: Both start with world creation, both can get bogged down if you don't say "When" soon (our first Universalis game has something like 40 "facts"; we only had about 9 in Microscope, which was great, mostly because I brought up that comparison to Universalis and everyone nodded their heads sagely; seemed that they had all seen that effect of Too Much Shit in the Start). Also, the other comparison is that the actual Playing of Roles ("role-playing") is not the Telos of the game, it's just one of the three things that the game consists of, which is world-building and story/element creation. Role-playing isn't the center or core of the game. &lt;--- This is the only thing that I saw the game judged on, re Mike above, which is a judgment that can be fairly made of the game without having played a "true 3-4 person sesison".<br/><br/>Anyway, as we laid the cards out we came up with a world (not Earth) torn apart by a religious schism and war, a return to stone ages, a feudal period, a post-scarcity society and almost transcendence (technology provides, and people return to hunter/gatherers). Most of the start was "black", while the end was noticeably "white". <br/><br/>We went through all the mechanics with the sole exception of declarative scenes, which is where one person sets up the scene then does a quick "puppet show" in front of everyone else describing who is in it, what happens, and it ends with no playing of roles. Almost like a cut-scene. We got through one full Lens (Julia, focusing on the hunting/gathering transhumanist society), and in the end even created the first Legacy.<br/><br/>When we actually had scenes, we knew that 7 people was too much. Heck even four people was too much at times. So I did a spot-hack which was basically, "OK, starting with the next person simply say if you want to be in the scene or not. Once we hit for YESes, we stop. The NOs will be in the next scene we do". So in the end, we only had 3-4 people per scene still, and the scenes were short enough that no one lost attention.<br/><br/>Anyway, after play the game affirmed to me that I want to look deeper into it, and since I now know how it plays out, to run it for a more intimate group of 3-4 people locally. I really like what it professes to do, and in play I see that it does what it says pretty well, but I think I want 2-3 sessions (or at least one full run around the table with each player as Lens) to form a real conclusion.<br/><br/>The advice is kind of spotty re ending of scenes: It says END IMMEDIATELY when the question for that scene is answered. However, there were some scenes we did where the answer came out and basically someone said "That's It! DONE!" like mid-sentence. I think there should be more advice or a quick actual play example of how to organically end a scene without cutting mid-sentence and also without resolving all the "problems" that appear in the scene. We ended up finding that sweet spot by the end of our round though.<br/><br/>I liked the Hotseat: I get where it's coming from, it truly does do what it says for Microscope, which is:<br/>* To make sure that the very well-meaning but unconsciously socially inclusive person doesn't accidentally direct the game so that the game goes smoothly by pushing down the middle of the road, and<br/>* To ensure true randomness, true "out of left field" results that will pop up in game that are almost incommensurable with some pieces, but critical to the kind of spontaneous, "I totally didn't expect that" kind of effect that really makes a game of Microscope interesting and unique.<br/><br/>Even moreso than Universalis, I can see this as "The game I use to create the initial gameworld for which we will then use Game X to play", but with a few more sessions I will be able to really form a better opinion of it as a game in and of itself: I'm still very favorable towards it, but need another session or two to solidify my thoughts.<br/><br/>In the end, the bits that will likely turn people off the most are:<br/>* Reduction of the importance of actual role-playing in the game; instead, as mentioned above, it is only one of the three legs of the game, not the center or the "point".<br/>* The "Hotseat": After initial setting creation, cooperation is cut off, and only the person in the Hotseat (the person whose turn it is) can suggest things or say what happens. <br/>* The fact that everything is procedural, there are no numbers/dice/cards.<br/><br/>Any questions, ask away.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327500/#Comment_327500" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T07:56:08+00:00" title="June  2, 2011  7:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2011 7:56AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>* The "Hotseat": After initial setting creation, cooperation is cut off, and only the person in the Hotseat (the person whose turn it is) can suggest things or say what happens.</blockquote>\nI love the Hot Seat, and I think its purpose is grand and something I need in games (I tend to be the "unconsciously socially inclusive person [who] ... accidentally direct[s] the game" and I need systems to stop me from doing that).<br/><br/>However, as I said before, the Hot Seat underlines one of the things I don't like about the game, which is that it doesn't give you grist to work with creatively.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played it, too, and enjoyed it quite a bit.<br/><br/>It gives a good structure for the creation of a nuanced history of a world or culture, with bits that keep you focused on the important, dramatic events of that history, not tangential details (like background details or specific currencies - ironically, perhaps, people into that kind of world-building might be less satisfied with this game: Microscope seems to be more about the flow of history and its twists and turns than detailed world-building).<br/><br/>That said, it doesn't *give* you much: you pretty much do it all yourselves as you play, which can be a plus or a minus. I wouldn't expect this game to go over well with a group of people who are not into being creative and sitting in the spotlight while the others sit and listen. The "Hot Seat" effect is very very present in this game, and the text even tells you not to collaborate with the other players but go do it on your own (I agree with Andy's reasons for this, up above). More so than in just about any other game I've played: when your turn comes around, you're hanging there and you'd better come up with something.<br/><br/>The "roleplaying" tends to be fairly rare, brief and focused, and completely freeform, if we understood the rules correctly. So it'll appeal to you if you like freeform roleplaying, but not the extended, "get into your character's skin" kind of freeform roleplaying: you need to set up punchy scenes and play through them quickly.<br/><br/>Overall, my experience of the game was one of a structured way to get a group to take turns coming up with cool stuff and telling the others what their latest cool idea is.<br/><br/>I can certainly see why some would want to call it "a toy" rather than "a game". And I can imagine many saying "it's not a roleplaying game", as the "roleplaying" portion can easily get skipped or cut out altogether in play.<br/><br/>From my limited experience with the game (one session, and it's possible we got some things wrong), it's a great way to create a historical setting full of drama (rather than world-building specifics), and one that a) surprises everyone at the table with its twists, and b) leaves everyone feeling pretty heavily invested in the world/history you've created. It does that very well, given a group of creative and enthusiastic players who are not afraid of "the spotlight".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327569/#Comment_327569" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T13:07:03+00:00" title="June  2, 2011  1:07PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2011 1:07PM by Valamir.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">In the end, the bits that will likely turn people off the most are:<br/>\n* Reduction of the importance of actual role-playing in the game; instead, as mentioned above, it is only one of the three legs of the game, not the center or the "point".<br/>\n* The "Hotseat": After initial setting creation, cooperation is cut off, and only the person in the Hotseat (the person whose turn it is) can suggest things or say what happens.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nYeah, these are the things that I didn't particularly care for.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards to the first I would have preferred to just have the quasi roleplaying eliminated all together.  There isn't really enough meat to any of the characters to really sink your teeth into, and no real way to build towards such.  To me I'd rather see either the roleplaying aspect elevated, or gone entirely.  The middle ground kinda-sorta roleplaying did not entertain me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hotseat is also a bother to me.  Unless I was really jonesing for a game with a particular group of people and Microscope was all they wanted to play, I don't think I'd play it again with the RAW hotseat rules.  I simply don't want any one person to have that kind of control over a game that I'm in.  Its like all of the worst aspects of railroading magnified...and without the advantage that a rail road normally has of being carefully and lovingly crafted.  Instead its spur of the moment whatever pops in your head improv railroading...and EVERYBODY gets to take turns driving the crazy train.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, if I'm going to invest time and effort and brain power into a game, I'm going to be pissed if it gets completely derailed into something I'm unable to enjoy with no ability to intervene to keep it from going there.  That's why there are Challenge rules in Universalis.  Frex, I don't like gonzo wacky surreal mad cap crazy.  Both collaboration and veto techniques help me ensure I'm not about to play a game that goes gonzo wacky surreal mad cap crazy.  In the absence of those...if the game goes there, there's nothing I can do about it, and I've just wasted however many hours of my life on something I loathe.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow most game of Universalis I've ever been in never even used the Challenge rules and when they did it wasn't on "serious" game breaker challenges...because the very existance of the rule keeps people from going somewhere where they know they'll lose the challenge anyway.  Veto powers work much like collaboration techniques in that sense.  Their effectiveness lies in people self editing based on established precedent so as to avoid being vetoed in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me winding up in a place where I have absolutely no desire to be is a bigger negative than getting to a place I've never been before is a positive.  So I much prefer reducing the potential for the latter in order to greatly reduce the possibility of the former.  The Hotseat rule takes the opposite view.  I suspect it works extremely well for people with priorities flip flopped from mine in that regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327574/#Comment_327574" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T13:23:42+00:00" title="June  2, 2011  1:23PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2011 1:36PM by johnzo.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the railroad / crazy train / derailed extended metaphor is a poor way to describe Microscope, because the game is by nature non-linear.  It moves in several directions at once, and contains multitudes.<br><br>I've played in Microscope games where the Hot Seat player created something I completely did. not. get.  But that was okay -- I could just build elsewhere in the chronology.  And my quiet rejection does not prevent the rest of the table from evolving the weird contribution.<br><br>Also, as someone who has difficulty shutting up, I like how the Hot Seat challenges me to shut up.   It also challenges me to relax ownership on my contributions to the game, to not plan anything beyond what is  happening just this moment.  Every Microscope game I've played has achieved storytelling of a far greater magnitude than I could achieve on my own, and I think that the Hot Seat has been key to that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14372/microscope-does-anyone-not-like-it" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14372/microscope-does-anyone-not-like-it" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14372/microscope-does-anyone-not-like-it/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14372%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14372%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
