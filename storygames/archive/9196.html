The equivalent in D&amp;D; would be players roleplaying adventurers who have their own classes. There are five fortes that players can chooses from: firebrand, heretic, infiltrator, renegade, saboteur. The firebrand gets to be the mouthpiece of the insurrectionists. Renegades fight; infiltrators sneak,cheat and steal; and heretics pray for miracles. In theory a saboteur should do the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Saboteurs use destruction and mayhem to advance their cabal\u2019s cause. Whether destroying buildings, alliances or plans, saboteurs are the strategists of a cabal. Many cabals owe their continued existence to saboteurs who have hindered the plans of corrupt authorities.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice, however, it doesn't work out that way. Firebrands, renegades and infiltrators get to shine because they're regularly presented with challenges which can be resolved in ways appropriate to their particular fortes. Heretics less so, but because they're the only insurrectionists that can pray for miracles, it tends to balance things out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm stuck on how to make saboteurs more enjoyable to play and I'm even considering abandoning the forte altogether. I want to keep sabotuers in the game, and I have a vague idea that like heretics, they should be able to do something unique rather than simply be better at doing certain things. As with heretics in my game, I don't want the players of saboteurs to have to pay or be penalized for doing what they're supposed to do, they should  be rewarded, i.e. players are rewarded for their heretic praying for miracles.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background on the game itself: the game uses a system of drawing coloured beads to determine the outcome of challenges. They win influence points which can be used to change the number of beads they draw during a challenge. Players narrate the outcome of their insurrectionist's challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203537/#Comment_203537" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-25T10:25:47+00:00" title="April 25, 2009 10:25AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2009 10:26AM by Destriarch.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a little difficult to give precise advice without knowing how your game deals with large-scale conflicts, but my standpoint is this: the Saboteur gets to blow shit up. That card trumps a whole lot of stuff. You want to destroy a hardened target, you need your Saboteur. That's not all they can do though. They can also lay traps for the enemy to blunder into, cut through enemy traps or create diversions so that their friends can escape.<br><br>Here's my suggestion then. Before any serious battle starts your saboteur gets to make a test. Depending on how well he does, he gets a certain number of strategy points. These can be used within the game's system to suddenly introduce things that he set up beforehand for just such an eventuality, but in retrospect! In other words, the character thinks ahead but the player controlling him doesn't need to.<br><br>"Oh I just knew we'd have to be going this way to escape, so I rigged *that* wall to explode and block the tunnel." *BOOM*<br><br>Hope this is helpful.<br><br>-Ash                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203542/#Comment_203542" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-25T11:53:48+00:00" title="April 25, 2009 11:53AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you considered making the ability to hinder The Man somehow native to all of the classes?

However, it may not work for every group playing the game. For example, my own group favours stories in which the insurrectionists don't fully understand what's going on, aren't as skilled or as clever as they would like to believe, and despite their better intentions often allow their base instincts to get the better of them. Having an insurrectionist with almost preternatural foresight, might not work for such a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason, it has occurred to me that the saboteur seems to be somewhere between the infiltrator and firebrand, even if they different objectives. Maybe I should drop create a sabotage rule for all the fortes and drop the saboteur from the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
