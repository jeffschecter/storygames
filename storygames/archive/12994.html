The Agency had closed the case shortly after analyzing it and failing to come up with compelling evidence for foul play, and he was determined to figure out what actually happened. The man he was hunting was a ghost, and his apartment was clearly a front. He was held up by a mysterious figure in his car, and left a folder full of information on one Jim Barker, to be found at the Pyramid Casino...<br/><br/>Next was Felix Batista, an ex-spec ops agent who was well into a bottle of Captain Morgan when he checked into the Pyramid Casino under the name of... Morgan. He was here to beat the system, and his first task was to identify the weakest dealer. He located the man, but noticed that the ever-wakeful eye of the Pitboss was upon him, and decided to play it safe to avoid detection. He received an invite to a private gathering later on in the evening, from an unknown party...<br/><br/>Finally we had Jim Barker, who was here on an anonymous job from the system he usually used to get wetwork jobs from the Revolution. This time he was asked to watch one Felix Batista, for reasons that were never revealed. Instead he ended up plotting with Batista to cheat the casinos out of a ridiculous amount of money and disappear into the depths of the system.<br/><br/>Detective Bennett found out that Jim Barker was the one who killed his man, and the Agency, using the Revolution's anonymity as a tool to eliminate key leaders of the Revolution, was trying to cover up the crime. Officer Watkins, who turned out to be Felix's ex-wife, was working with Jim and trying to use the Agency to spy on Batista, was caught in the act by Detective Bennet. Batista's plot to cheat the casino worked, and when the security systems went dark and credited a physical credit stick with the funds, a gunshot was heard. The Agency's forces, tipped off by the Casino, had surrounded the area and were about to arrest Batista and eliminate Jim in the process, thus forever closing the door that Detective Bennett was trying to open.<br/><br/>In the end, Batista was shot and killed after cheating the casino (but not fully enough to put it out of business, like he ultimately wanted), Jim made it out into the wild with a huge amount of U.S. currency (and no one ever found out who he really was), and Detective Bennett proved that the Agency's data-analysis algorithms could never work 100% of the time due to the unpredictable nature of human emotions and motives.<br/><br/>In the epilogue, Jim was out somewhere in the world enjoying his life and toasting Batista, and Detective Bennett had started his own private detective agency, dedicated to using human intuition and ingenuity to solve the crimes that the Agency's methods couldn't handle.<br/><br/><b>Thoughts</b><br/><br/>This game is fun! The book is a bit hard to read, although it is very pretty. We had some trouble with the rules and had to flip back and forth a bit to find key information (scene framing and when a scene ends were hard to find). Other than that, it's a great game! Even those quibbles are minor; if you take the time to really read the book and take it all in, you shouldn't have any problem running the game.<br/><br/>It's funny that we all independently made characters who were older and had reasons to resist Information Age technology. We all had high scored in Subversion, except Felix who I think was pretty middle-of-the-road on the Mainstream over Subversion Praxis Scale.<br/><br/>We did a few things wrong, probably. We didn't use the Minutiae as well as we could have as Audience members -- as far as I can recall, no one invented characters or used the characters in the Minutiae when throwing their d4s. A lot of the time the Audience member wouldn't be able to affect the roll of either *Tagonist and we would just gloss over the Audience member's participation. Should we do that? Should they narrate an attempt to alter conflict, even if they can't?<br/><br/>Also, Jack Bennett was the only character to ever lose a conflict and gain Features. I did this on purpose -- the first two conflicts he was in were him attempting to use the Agency's system (Mainstream) to solve his case, but it didn't work out. The other players had wicked good rolls or always landed on the Fulcrum and picked up the spare in the escalated reroll.<br/><br/>Also: when you land on the Fulcrum during a conflict and reroll the conflict, do both sides escalate? Or is it just the opposition player (d4s) who narrates a worse outcome if the rerolling player (d10s) fails?<br/><br/>Oh, and finally: is there any other way to bring a Protagonist into a scene other than an Audience member introducing him as a modifier (d4) to the Conflict? Can the Protagonist ever fully enter another Protagonist's scene? Can the Antagonist player bring his Protagonist character in as opposition if it's appropriate to the story? Can the Antagonist player get permission from another Protagonist player to bring their Protagonist into a scene?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

If not, can that throw off the pacing, since it's the Antagonist's burning of credits for die roles that will probably bring that storyline to a close?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
