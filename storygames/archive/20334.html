I went ahead an did an illustration for the warlord in a style somewhat similar to that used in the corebook, just for fun. Critique on both encouraged. I'll be releasing both under a cc license on my website after a touch of criticism and playtest.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback!<br/><br/><a href="http://freeforall.cc/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Warlord_DW.pdf" rel="nofollow">Warlord Playbook</a><br/><br/><img alt="image" height="800" src="http://freeforall.cc/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Warlord5.png" width="600"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448237/#Comment_448237" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-27T13:33:01+00:00" title="August 27, 2015  1:33PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi there! Cool idea and some good implementations in places, but a few issues I see.<br/><br/>*) The failure condition on "A Heart Emboldened" is really weird. On the one hand, it's a very severe penalty, I think. But on the other hand, once you've failed, there's no further penalty to keep trying again (except wasted time). Maybe: "On a 6-, you've discouraged where you'd hoped to empower. Choose one PC that can hear you; they take -1-forward.".<br/><br/>*) "A Heart Emboldened": I would make the 10+ option simply "All allies who can see or hear you". This will rarely be more than three, is simpler, and is more fictionally consistent.<br/><br/>*) "Espirit De Corps": I assume "the game" and "a game" refer to a single session (implicit based on similar wording in the Elf racial power)? I think usually the book uses "session" for this time span, but I don't think this sort of timing trigger exists almost anywhere else, so it feels really weird in the fiction. Also they already have five bonds and get a bonus on aiding, so this is only more double-dipping. If you want to capture a useful and more unique ability, I think something like: "When you spend time in deep conversation with a PC ally, planning and encouraging, roll+cha. On a 7-9, give them one hold. On a 10+, they also take +1-forward. They can spend their hold to roll+your bond with them instead of the usual stat for one roll. On a 6-, treat their bond with you as one lower until they visibly acknowledge your leadership skills.".<br/><br/>*) "Helping Hand": "Furthermore, you may 'Aid' an ally by encouraging them or offering advice over the din of battle." - I already play that this is a valid tactic but some GMs may not. So, for me it's redundant, but it might be nice reminder text for the player or GM...<br/><br/>*) "An Ounce of Loyalty": Already you just repeat the trigger for loyalty checks, which is essentially the only time it's checked. Instead you can just say, "When you roll+loyalty, take +1 to the roll.".<br/><br/>*) The racial abilities seem kind of lacking to me. The dwarf one is highly situation (for example, in a party of four dwarfs and using the current Espirit De Corps, you could have 4/4/3 bond score with the rest of the party, but in a party with no other dwarves the bonus is pointless). On the other hand, re-rolls seem like a very rare (and maybe powerful?) ability, but also kind of boring.<br/><br/>*) Bonds: These are mostly good, but "is a sheep or a lion" seems to mix metaphors. We usually talk of "lions and lambs" and "wolves and sheep", so I'd pick one of those pairs and stick to it (though this could be a cultural difference? I don't know where you're from)<br/><br/>*) Gear: Looks okay to me!<br/><br/>*) HP: I'd probably make HP 8+, honestly. Gut instinct.<br/><br/>*) Advancements: The advancements seem very wanting to me... specifics to follow in next post.<br/><br/>All this said, it looks quite good visually, is a cool concept, and has some decent ideas, so please don't be disheartened by this feedback!<br/><br/>- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448238/#Comment_448238" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-27T14:11:09+00:00" title="August 27, 2015  2:11PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [2/2 - advancements]<br/><br/>*) "Sweep of the Eye"/"Born Commander": These seem unnecessarily specific as far as multi-class advancements go. Whereas, I think the only advancement that gives a single specific move is the Ranger God Amongst the Wastes.<br/><br/>*) "Best Laid Plans": I think Bolster/Preparation is underused so I approve. (Also why I made a class centered around it!)<br/><br/>*) "Comrades in Arms": Not very exciting but a fine move. The wording is probably too dense. Maybe "When you defend an ally, you may roll+bond instead of +con."<br/><br/>*) "Form Up, On Me!": DW doesn't have turns, first off. Secondly, I think it's just kind of not very exciting? Maybe something like "When one of your allies defends another ally under your orders, they gain +1-armor.".<br/><br/>*) "Led By A Lion": I personally try to shy away from these sorts of move-specific moves (unless they're just stat substitution, extra hold, etc). Maybe more interesting is: "When you lead the charge into battle and strike an enemy, your allies take +1-damage against them as long as you stay in the melee.".<br/><br/>*) "Ply A Bloody Trade": Boring, kind of. I would rather see something like "You have a reputation for danger. When you order a hireling into a dangerous situation, treat a 7-9 as a 10+.".<br/><br/>*) "Rallying Cry": Again, there are no turns, so this doesn't make much sense conceptually. Something like "Coordinated Strike: When you order your allies into position to strike at once, roll+int. On a 7-9, pick one and have them roll damage against an enemy in range. On a 10+, they also add +1-damage for each additional ally assisting in the strike (including you). On a miss, you've exposed everyone in the attack to danger.".<br/><br/>*) "To Him Who Will Try": If you use the group-based version above, this makes no sense. Maybe "On a 12+, in addition, the next time one of these allies makes a roll, they treat a 6- as a 7-9."<br/><br/>*) "Dare Mighty Things": This is only a slightly better version of "To Him Who Will Try" and doesn't replace/require it. Instead, maybe simply, "When you use A Heart Emboldened, choose two options instead of one.".<br/><br/>*) "Lead From The Front": This is okay, maybe worded a bit strange to me? Is it your bond with them, their bond with you, some other bond?<br/><br/>*) "Know Your Enemy": The requirement on this seems un-needed. Also, the wording is a bit off, I think. Maybe: "When you study an enemy for weak points, ask the GM 'Where should we focus our attacks?' and he'll answer truthfully. Then, roll+int. On a 10+, your allies' attacks gain +2-piercing if they follow the GM's advice. On a 7-9, your allies attacks only gain +1-piercing. On a miss, your allies attacks still gain +1-piercing, but you've put yourself in significant risk to study the enemy.".<br/><br/>*) "A List of Things That Won't Happen": Nice, but worded a bit clunky. Maybe just "When you bolster for two weeks, you gain 3-preparation and give all your allies 1-preparation.".<br/><br/>*) "Mercenary Captain": Cost is not usually an explicit numeric value, so this one seems really weird. Maybe "When a hireling under your orders would die, they are instead maimed. When they'd be maimed, they are instead wounded. When they'd be wounded, they are instead tired." or something. I'm not really sure. A mercenary captain should get good at keeping his men alive...<br/><br/>*) "Band of Brothers": Both very boring and very good. I'd axe this.<br/><br/>*) "Champion and Companion": I'd re-word it. "When you'd suffer an attack, if an ally you have 3+ bond with is close enough, they may redirect that attack to themselves.". Otherwise I like this one.<br/><br/>*) "Few Against Many": I'm not sure there are many times you'd roll +cha when outnumbered? Maybe? Not terrible but kind of lacking to me.<br/><br/>---<br/>*) Ideas for more/new stuff<br/><br/>So, I think adding a move to multiclass with bard moves makes sense to me. Maybe the multi-class moves should just be "Gain a bard, fighter, or paladin move." at basic advancement and another at level 6+.<br/><br/>I think adding something like "Gain a bond slot." at basic advancement and 6+ would be pretty nice.<br/><br/>Something that is a move using a badge of authority would be really cool and synergize with the gear.<br/><br/>A move or two, either as class moves or advancements, that gives some additional unique capability might be nice. Right now it seems like the only options are "Get preparation, roll a heart emboldened, aid aid aid aid aid." which is okay but kind of boring.<br/><br/>Move idea: a move that enhances any basic move an ally makes. Um...<br/><br/>"Cunning Directions: When you give specific orders to an ally, roll+int. On a 10+, choose one. On a 7-9, choose one but you've put yourself in danger or opened yourself to danger.<br/>* The next time they hack and slash, they may also knock down, push back, or disarm their target (even on a miss).<br/>* The next time they volley, they roll damage twice and take the higher value.<br/>* The next time they defend, they get +1-hold (even on a miss).<br/>* The next time they spout lore, on a 7+, you may also ask the GM one question on the subject, which they'll answer truthfully.<br/>* The next time they discern realities, after answering any questions, the GM will also tell them one thing they notice or figure out (even on a miss).<br/>* The next time they parley, on a miss, they suffer no consequences except failing their request and can ask the GM "What would be a more effective leverage to get what I want from them?"."<br/><br/>This isn't perfect but you get the idea.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Overall review: I think a lot of the moves and overall structure needs polished, but it looks quite good and is a good idea and you're on the road to something really cool.<br/><br/>-Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/freeforall" title="freeforall"><img alt="freeforall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/freeforall">freeforall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448248/#Comment_448248" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-27T22:48:58+00:00" title="August 27, 2015 10:48PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't read through it all yet, but I'm excited to check out it.
