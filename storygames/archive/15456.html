For the rest of you, Victoria is a game of intrigue set against the backdrop of Victorian England. It's got shadowy secret societies, the supernatural, and plenty of background about the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows out in a couple of weeks, if you're inspired by the movie or the era in general check it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.victoriaroleplaying.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350467/#Comment_350467" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T18:44:42+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  6:44PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2011 6:45PM by jenskot.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The core system sounds like fun: <a href="http://www.hazardgaming.com/engine.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hazardgaming.com/engine.html</a><br/><br/>Can you tell us more about the price for using Plot Points to succeed after rolling?

The spending is one plot point for stretching your main one point. You can also spend one to coincidentally have a contact or to affect the story in some way. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are some of the guidelines but there are more in the book. It's a central idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe name does reflect that you can choose to play the points in advance or risk it and play them afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a fully worked sample adventure and the book contains long (perhaps too long) scenarios that describe all the rules. I wrote them from the standpoint of someone with no experience running for others with no experience. For veterans they can skip the examples and cut to the chase.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350487/#Comment_350487" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T21:13:41+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  9:13PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2011 9:18PM by John_Harper.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PDF received, thanks!<br/><br/>Overall, I quite like it. The extended examples are great to have, even for an old pro. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The system seems like it could be fun and the focus on social class is great. I like the level of detail you've provided for Victorian England. There's enough to use at the table, but it doesn't feel overwhelming. I'll definitely be using some bits in my current Victorian game.<br/><br/>I find the PDF to be a little hard to read on the iPad, due to the rough period-style font choice and really poorly justified text. It's not a huge deal, but is a little annoying. There are also quite a few blank pages which looked like a mistake at first, but are just odd pagination, I guess. I do like the period engravings used as illustrations. Most are very nice.<br/><br/>I just got to the Gamemastering chapter, and hit the section where it suggests that the GM should fudge dice rolls. Ugh. That's a VERY sour note for me. Time to set the book aside for a bit. I'll come back to it later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hazard" title="hazard"><img alt="hazard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hazard">hazard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350488/#Comment_350488" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T21:27:17+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  9:27PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pleased it hit at least some of the right notes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe blank pages are so that the chapters always start on a facing page, just a style choice I suppose. I'm not sure about the justified text problem. I will have to look at it again on my iPad to see if something's happened during the conversion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFudging dice rolls is a contentious issue, I know, and there's really no right answer for everyone, at least not for a story game, but the resolution system doesn't rely on it for balance. Going by the dice will work just fine, in fact the combat system definitely supports that and contains a mechanism where senseless deaths can be avoided.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for the feed-back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350491/#Comment_350491" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T22:07:22+00:00" title="December  4, 2011 10:07PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry if I sounded a bit harsh there, Daniel.
