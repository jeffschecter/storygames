I enjoyed figuring out the riddle posed by zombie Socrates after he couldn't get into Hades.<br/>\nI ran "Rex Rich and the Warlord of Mars" using Spirit of the Century and had a blast; my favorite moment was when the player playing Dr. Einstein, Greatest Mind of All Time, used his Science skill to out-maneuver his nemesis Professor Planck by challenging him to a test of scientific knowledge in front of his science troopers. "Is a photon a particle or a vave?" Planck blew his roll and flubbed his answer. "Ha ha," said Phil Lewis, playing Einstein with a sort of querulous German accent, "it vas a trick qvestion! It is <i>both</i>!" The players made me laugh pretty hard.<br/>\nI ran two games of Ganakagok, one as a pick-up game with Don and Joanna Corcoran and Mike Holmes, which was a nice moment for me because Mike had given the game honorable mention in the Game Chef contest that he judged a few years ago.<br/>\nMel, Cary Collett, and I playtested "The Perilous Realm," my new game-in-development in which player-characters are travelers to the kingdom of Prester John in the 12th century and face off against the dark angel Wormwood and his apocalypse.<br/>\nThe highlight was when Mel and I played a dirty hippie pick-up version of Traveller. We did that Friday and Saturday nights, and even roped in Cary as well as Mike Holmes (not quite kicking and screaming) to play with us and had a great time. Mel and I dug it so much I think we're going to try again at Dexcon!<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Jeez, almost forgot. And I played Paul Czege's Nine Worlds scenario "Kill Oedipus" along with Cary and the couple from Albuquerque (Philip and Jen Lewis). Paul described it as "Tarantino meets Sophocles" and it lived up to the bill.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a really great time.

Everyone else plays the village\u2019s women, who see in Kagematsu a potential savior.  The game plays out as a series of romantic (or not-so-romantic) encounters as the women attempt to entice Kagematsu into staying and defending their little village.  In the end, they must ply the hope he provides against the thing they fear most, or be lost entirely.<br/><br/>Kagematsu is designed to be played in a single evening.  It plays best with around 4 people, and you absolutely can not play it without out at least one female in your group.</br></br></blockquote>\nThe important thing is that you play opposite your gender.

Short form, combat runs like the wind, it desperately needs quick reference charts, and I had to immediately house-rule that everybody on both sides gets 2 actions, not one, after my clever playtesters just walked away from the fight... I wish there were more pre-made adversaries to give me a better idea of what's balanced.  I haven't even *looked* at Secrets (the first supplement), and Poor Richard's Almanac is coming out soon.  Also, the author is working on a revised edition to address some of the problems like charts and indices.  They have an excellent wiki with loads of keen info, and that is helpful.<br/><br/>The playtesters liked it enough to request more games.<br/><br/>Jae                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154391/#Comment_154391" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T09:01:25+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  9:01AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a really good time.

We got briefly interrupted by a tornado (it may just have been a microburst, but tornado sounds better). It was neat!<br/><br/>Ralph Mazza, Mike Holmes and I had a chance to try out the new Tribune board game. It was fun!

Oops.<br/><br/>Paul Czege ran Avengers of Justice! for me, Clyde, Mike Miller and Ralph. I got to play Brick Red. It was an interesting game from the early 90s with a handful of cool ideas and a few stinkers. The core idea of the comic flowchart was very cool. I'd love to see an execution of it that works.<br/><br/>I ran a game of Mouse Guard for Paul, Danielle, Ralph and Mike Holmes (who subbed for Clyde when he ran to do an interview). I think MG is the easiest game I've ever run.<br/><br/>I played a game of Marvel Superheroes (FASERIP) run by my friend Nick Logue (who's written some great material for both WotC and Paizo and who now runs his own indie D20 module imprint, Sinister Adventures). I got to play Kid Nitro, an adrenaline junkie with a snowboard and twin freezie pistols powered by liquid nitrogen tanks on my back. Jared played my sidekick Shepherd (a brilliant scientist who lost most of his intelligence when his genetic code was mutated by the introduction of the genes of a German Shepherd). There were also a bunch of other folks at the table whom I didn't know that well. Nick is an incredibly entertaining GM. This was a lot of fun!<br/><br/>I ran a playtest of Dark Pages with Clyde and Jared. Great stuff. Clyde played a sinister adept who'd sold his best friend's soul to a demon by mistake, and is now working for that demon as a fixer in an attempt to win the soul back. Jared played a vigilante guerrilla journalist obsessed with a female former coworker. It was creepy and fun!<br/><br/>On Sunday, Luke and I had our flight home canceled by nasty thunderstorms in NYC. Fortunately Fred Hicks, Rob Donoghue and Paul Tevis were incredibly gracious and allowed us to crash on their floor before catching our flight home early the next morning.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a blast!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154409/#Comment_154409" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T09:55:07+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  9:55AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did an interview with Fred Hicks about Dresden Files RPG that I will be posting online here in the next week or so.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154411/#Comment_154411" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T09:57:38+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  9:57AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a great time. I playtested Acts of Evil on Thursday evening with Clyde, Don Corcoran, and Michael S. Miller as the GM. It was a pre-arranged game so I could see play from the player perspective to inform how I write the final game text. Then later that same Thursday evening I was interviewed by Luke Crane. It was less about promoting Half Meme Press or The Ashcan Front than prior interviews I've done. More about my design and creative aspirations and what I think about design trends. It was great.<br/><br/>Avengers of Justice is a superhero RPG from the turn of the 90s that I think has some thought-provoking mechanics. It was in the schedule for Friday as an IGE event with me as GM, but no one had signed up for it. Fortunately, Thor Olavsrud, Michael S. Miller, Ralph Mazza, and Clyde L. Rhoer bombed into it with generic tickets. One reason I run scheduled games is because as a designer there aren't enough opportunities to run games I've never experienced before. (Whoa, violation of the social contract to run an unplaytested scenario for a game you've never run before? Nobody rat me out!)<br/><br/>Thor ran Mouse Guard for me, Danielle, Ralph, and Mike Holmes on Friday evening. Remember the boring ass outdoor exploration-via-skill challenges gameplay in a lot of 80s era games? Roll repeatedly to climb a cliff face? Roll a skill challenge to use your tricorder to find the mineral deposits the company wants? Mouse Guard solves that bullshit.<br/><br/>Had a very thought-provoking conversation with Mike Holmes on Saturday morning about the relationship between the "story game" social culture, the mechanical signature of the games of the culture, and how games rely on or challenge the social culture. I already had a pretty good plan for the final text of Acts of Evil, but this conversation totally re-galvanized me in my plan. Ran my Nine Worlds "Kill Oedipus" scenario that afternoon to a full table of people I'd never met before (one of whom was Bill White). Another reason I run scheduled games is to meet new people. And two of the Nine Worlds players then went on to participate as playtesters for Danielle for Kagematsu that evening. This is awesome. And that playtest was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>And then on Sunday morning I playtested Clyde's Silence Keeps Me A Victim, which he's developing as an ashcan for Gen Con, and gave him feedback. And that was fun.<br/><br/>I really wanted to meet up with Grant Davis to playtest Secrets and Lies. It will also be an ashcan at Gen Con. But. There. Just. Wasn't. Time!<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154415/#Comment_154415" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T10:02:39+00:00" title="July  2, 2008 10:02AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thor</cite>The important thing is that you play opposite your gender.

I was impressed at how easy it is to whip something up if you have a module to crib from. Thor had the Shadow-whatever module Wizards has put out and I never saw it before, but it was easy to steal from with those maps and stat blocks. I was also impressed at how easy it was to change the difficulty of challengers based on the number of players you have. We did two encounters and called it a night. That second encounter had Thor's human ranger at one hit point, and Luke's Cleric low on resources also. I simply chose the appropriate number of monsters based on their xp, and we had a fairly close game.<br/><br/>Thursday I played in Acts of Evil. I enjoyed the game even though I tend not to play it correctly. One day I'll have to map out a strategy, and give up my characters humanity to play the game. Acts of Evil is pushing for a different kind of play than what I'm used to, or a style other than what I want, despite my words otherwise, and it beats you up until you "get" that kind of play. For now I'm still fighting the game. Perhaps permanently, which makes me wonder if I don't need to learn the secret lesson of the game.<br/><br/>Friday I played in Paul's Avengers of Justice game mentioned above. It had some really cool ideas that were occluded by it's mechanics. I couldn't just punch someone, so when my two attack powers powered down, I was left with no meaningful way to contribute to the fiction. The most fun part of the game is where we basically defaulted to a freestyle form of play to do something else other than fighting, or as traditional folks might say, we made the system get out of our way for awhile. Someone should pirate this game for good ideas and make rules that actually work.<br/><br/>I also played Mouseguard for a brief bit, and I yearn for this game. <br/><br/>I played Darkpages also and had a bit of a hard time at first as I don't have an understanding of the fiction that inspired the game and was too tired to be very creative. Once I got that we were thinking in squares I started to get the game much better.<br/><br/>Paul playtested my game Silence Keeps Me A Victim, and gave me a lot of useful feedback.<br/><br/>I also interviewed Andrea Sfiligoi creator of Song of Blades and Heroes, Peter Atkinson, Thor Olavsrud, and my microphones might have recorded other secretive audio.<br/><br/>I also got to chat with quite a few folks, which was good.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> minus cilantro for the win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snik" title="snik"><img alt="snik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snik">snik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154525/#Comment_154525" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T15:45:44+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  3:45PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Burning Empires which was great fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played Hunter: the Vigil which was also great mostly due to some excellent players and a cool risking willpower mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to play in a Vampire Rome game but it was pretty boring. Although, it was a nice history refresher.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played in a pretty fun Call of Cthulhu game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played in a great Dread game where the players awake in a supermarket located in an abandoned New York City. It was fun trying to escape as everything rotted around us and some horrifying spider creature chased us. I believe all but one of us brought the jenga tower down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last game I played was Mouse Guard on Saturday and it was a great way to end the con for me.

The dealer hall is smaller and much more manageable, and has a bunch of crafts, costumes, and non related geeky stuff instead of blaring electronic nonsense.  Open gaming is a breeze to find space for just about any time.  There are a good 4 or 5 solid hotels immediately adjacent (and often connected to ) the convention center.  The Big Bar on 2 is a fantastic evening hangout.  Food choices aren't as diverse as Indy, but the Food Court is a reasonable alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I used to go to Origins every year before the GenCon Forge Booth made me choose.  Its only been the last 2 years I've been back.
