We were at a weekend long Fourth of July house party, so we got to play two sessions over two days. It went really well, at least from my point of view as the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of great stuff happened, and I hope the players will read this and add more stuff, but the first one that jumps to my mind revolves around refueling the Owl. Naomi and Snagrl\xe8 were trying to quickly get some large canisters of fuel onto the autoloader mechanism. The Snargle\u2019s player had decided that she wanted Snagle to be a girl, hence the name change to Snagrl\xe8. Naomi had no problem muscling the giant fuel canister in to place, but when Snagrl\xe8 tried to repeat that achievement by shape-shifting into something bigger and stronger, she blew the roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM, \u201cSo what happens when Snagrl\xe8 tries to violate the laws of conservation of mass to become bigger and tougher?\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer, \u201cUm... she\u2019s pregnant!\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nGM, blink... pause... \u201cOK, she\u2019s pregnant, and she only just realized it when she tried to shape-shift that part of her body, and realized she couldn\u2019t. She\u2019s freaked out because she doesn\u2019t know who the father is. We can have a flashback scene later to determine that.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer, \u201cNo, it was the shape-shifting that caused the pregnancy. It actually happened just then in the story. She tried to mess with the laws of the universe, and trying to create the extra mass made her pregnant instead.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nGM, blink... \u201cOK, but goblins don\u2019t reproduce asexually. This pregnancy is quantum entangled. The man who was/is going to be the father hasn\u2019t been determined yet. Snagrl\xe8 has to find him, and get him to father her child, or she risks creating a causal paradox that could rip a hole in the fabric of space and time.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer, \u201cAnd goblins gestate faster than normal humans, so she doesn\u2019t have that much time to find this guy.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother player, \u201cSo, will we have to help Snagrl\xe8 get laid to prevent the destruction of the universe?\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nGM, \u201cHmmmm, could be.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer, \u201cYes, totally!\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n(OK, I may have fudged a little bit of who said what, partly because I can\u2019t remember, but that\u2019s more of less the gist of it.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333337/#Comment_333337" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T09:40:48+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  9:40AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I thought human dating rituals were complex...<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333382/#Comment_333382" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T13:44:46+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  1:44PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is, without a doubt, the weirdest thing to ever happen in a Lady Blackbird game.<br/><br/>And that's saying something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain" title="exploding_brain"><img alt="exploding_brain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain">exploding_brain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333394/#Comment_333394" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T14:43:07+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  2:43PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sir, I take that as a tremendous complement.

I believe the thinking is, if Snagrl\xe8 can find a suitably awesome and/or heroic Baby-Daddy, the child will grow up to be the chosen one, who was prophesied to defeat the empire and free the peoples of the Wild Blue from the tyranny of the Empire, or something along those lines. Never has the task of helping one half crazy goblin chick get some action had such profound, cosmic repercussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I haven't even told you the part about the Ruben sandwich.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333396/#Comment_333396" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T14:55:13+00:00" title="July  6, 2011  2:55PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: exploding_brain</cite>And I haven't even told you the part about the Ruben sandwich.</blockquote>\nOh yes?<br/>I want to hear more.
