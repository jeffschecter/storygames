The Federalists and Anti-Federalists, Agrarians and Industrialists, Slavers and Abolitionists, all got their start in this period.  Lots of what we now recognize as "Democrat" and "Republican" got started here, too: just the names were different.<br/><br/>In any case, though, I have 17 Patriots in the game.  I want to give each of them a number of stances on divisive issues such that, given any pair of Patriots, they'll have something to fight over.  So something like:<br/><br/>Thomas Jefferson<br/>* Pro-Agrarian<br/>* Anti-Federalist<br/>* Slavery Apologist<br/>* And So On<br/><br/>If Jefferson was put up against Paul Revere, they could argue Agrarian/Industrialist issues.  If Jefferson is put up against Salem Poor, they could fight over Slavery.  And so on.<br/><br/>So here's the question: given 17 figures, how many issues (with binary yea/nay stances) do I need to have on each character to ensure a viable contest between any given pair?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Martin%20O%27Leary" title="Martin O'Leary"><img alt="Martin O'Leary" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Martin%20O%27Leary">Martin O'Leary</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71727/#Comment_71727" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T15:18:25+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  3:18PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Five issues will let you handle anything up to 32 figures.
