Five resulted in a review --one at the Forge, three at RPG.net, and one on some guy's LiveJournal. For the new edition, I sent out over a dozen review copies (mostly between August and September). I tried to send copies to people who have actually had reviews published (at places like RPG.net, as opposed to a blog). So far, two reviews have been written. One of the prospective reviewers decided not to write the review. The others, I'm still waiting to see. I mean, it's only been a few months.<br/><br/>I'm hoping that the majority of those copies will result in written reviews -- after all, it's really expensive, particularly with international shipping. Those review copies constituted the bulk of my marketing budget.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerry%20D.%20Grayson" title="Jerry D.

Consider sending copies to folk who have existing reviews.  They've already shown they have the interest in ability to sit down for a while and share their thoughts.<br/>2. If you're otherwise hesitant, try to find reviewers who are an active part of the community.  Remember how some publishers can't escape a negative stigma from a bad game, nasty attitude online, or whatever?  Reviewers have that same concern and obviously are as subject to a desire to be respected and valued by their community as anyone else is.<br/>3. When you're approached or soliciting ask "When do you think the review will be submitted?"  This puts the idea of a deadline in the reviewer's head, and it gives you at least a best guess to work with.  Some reviewers have nothing on their stack and will review the game immediatley, others could take months due to a large stack or various personal emergencies.<br/>4. Don't be afraid to touch bases with a reviewer.  A simple "Hey, how's it goin'?  Any idea when that review might get submitted?" does wonders.  Remember how folk tell you to call back after a job interview and that that contact can be a big deal?  It's like that.  If I've got 7 books on my stack that I received at about the same time and someone drops me an email asking, guess who gets reviewed next?<br/>5. Try to assume the best.  Nothing's going to suck quite like accusing someone of taking product and running like finding out they were in an accident or had a family emergency.  That said, if you can't get in contact with someone and it has been a more than reasonable time period (say, 6 months) then mention this on the forums.  Story-Games and RPG.net could both stand to have a reviewer thread where publishers mention reviewers that have come through and those that haven't.<br/><br/>How I Do It<br/>If I'm soliciting you then I'll send a short email asking about it.  When I receive a confirmation I will provide mailing details, a 'best guess' as to when the review will issue, and my promise to contact you when it does.  I think this is pretty basic stuff, but I don't know what other folk do.  I treat my reviews more like a hobby-job in how I approach them.  I think that if a reviewer doesn't offer to let you know when it's posted or provide a time frame then it's perfectly reasonable to ask.  You're already providing product, it shouldn't fall on you to hunt for the review later or wonder what happened to that $30 game you gave out.  The same applies if I receive a review request, but in the case I choose to turn it down I promptly notify the sender.<br/><br/>Publishers Who I Love<br/>1. Are polite even when the review is negative.  You may not even like me after a game review, but the truth is that I have the utmost respect for anyone who remains friendly and courteous after a negative review of their new game.  Justin of Blue Devil and, more recently, Lee Foster of Abstract Nova continue to stand out in my mind as going out of their way to be kind to me despite less than stellar reviews at the time.  Because of this I'm very likely to review their products in the future even if I'm not very interested because I respect them and enjoyed interacting with them.<br/>2. Clearly communicate with me via email.  I once asked Ron Edwards for some review copies of Sorcerer products.  Know what he said?  "No thanks."  And I really love him for it, because it was a polite but clear rejection.  It means I won't email him again in 3 months on the assumption that he missed my email, was busy, or didn't read past the subject line.  It also makes me respect him for taking the time to do that.<br/>3. Mention me to others.  Fred has done this several times, and I recently noticed Christian recommending me.  If you think it's hard to market your game, imagine trying to develop a positive reputation where you're asking people to trust you with their product.  Just a "Looking for reviews, eh?  This guy reviewed for me." is huge.  Once again, it makes me want to review for this publisher again and makes me want to return the favor when I can.<br/><br/>This thread really interests me, so I'll be hanging around <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112527/#Comment_112527" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T15:46:18+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  3:46PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2007 3:48PM by Graham.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A while ago, I asked for various games to review. I reviewed some and missed others. The ones I missed were because either:<br/><br/>a. I couldn't get people together to play the game.<br/>b. I wasn't into the game. This varied from one game I <i>really</i> wasn't into to one I thought was very well done, but not my thing. Because I'd only review games I played, I figured reviewing it wouldn't do anyone any favours: I'd be playing a game I wasn't into and they'd probably get a bad review. Best just to keep quiet.<br/><br/><br/>I only received one print copy which I didn't review. I sent that on to someone else to review. (Eventually.

I had plenty of time to do reviews when I was working odd jobs, but not so much now that I'm working in real 9 to 5 positions again).]<br/><br/>[Re-Edit: I tended to contact publishers for review copies when I saw something that interested me.

Strangely enough, we used to also get solicited weekly by someone wanting to review this title or that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we got serious about tracking reviews that sprung from these freely distributed goods. Put together a list of reviewers that never generated a review and started comparing those to a few other small publishers we're friends with. Started noticing there were common names among our lists and theres.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, we found too few reviews were generated by giving out freebies. We stopped giving out review copies. We figure the best review is a review from someone that has actually purchased the product. Now, if a recognized magazine or some other media outlet asked for a review copy, we would probably still give it. Just not to some random guy that says he does a bunch of reviews and would to review our stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI very much suspect the reason we don't hardly ever get review requests anymore is we have become known as a company that does not give out freebies for reviews when asked. This goes back to that common list of names. I really do think there is a segment of the community that figured out publishers will give free stuff to anyone that writes to them and says they'll do a review. Give out a freebie to one of those people and within a matter of weeks or months, the number of requests you will get rises significantly, as he basically tells all his friends within that particilar circle that you are an easy mark. They all then dogpile on asking for their "review" copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne approach we tried and is probably still a worthwhile program, if we cared to push for more reviews, was to offer a range of free product to anyone who previously bought one of our other games already and did a review and posted that review onto a site among our approached list of sites for that promotion. That cut down on the leeches just wanting free stuff, because in order to have done the review they had to have been a customer already, having previously purchased one of our other titles.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

I kid (a little) but seriously Fred is one of the publishers who paves the way in how to handle this (but he's certainly not the only one doing this).<br/><br/>You say "Thanks!"<br/><br/>I wrote a lot of reviews before I asked Dan Davenport "Hey... maybe I could get some comped copies?"  What kept me writing?  "Thanks!"  When you've just written a review of a game you really love and the author shows up to say "Thanks!" it's a really big deal.  A lot of Story-Gamers know each other, so I suspect it's getting a little hard for some of us to appreciate that "Thanks" when it's already someone we know or have interacted with for years in real life.  This isn't the case for the average reviewer, though.  For most reviewers the author is someone they have never meaningfully interacted with, and getting some positive feedback really makes a person feel good.<br/><br/>Remember how you felt after you published a game and you saw someone say "Wow, X's game is really awesome."  It's just the same for the reviewer, new to reviews or otherwise<br/><br/>Now, if I were a publisher I'd keep a list of names and email addresses of fans who reviewed my games in a positive light.  I'd then send them, at a minimum, a free PDF of my next product with a "Hey, thanks again for reviewing Awesome Game!  Here's a free copy of my new game.  If you have a chance to review it that would be wonderful, but if not please enjoy!"<br/><br/>Don't forget that any sort of 1 on 1 interaction with an author makes the reviewer feel like a part of the project, or at least really appreciated.  I remember one of the Zir'an authors emailing me after my Zir'an reviews (my first reviews) to say thanks and then just to talk with me about the game and what they had planned.  It made me feel like my review wasn't just appreciated as good exposure for the author, but also as a tool for criticism and feedback.<br/><br/>Let me share a little secret with you.  I hate writing reviews that are less than glowing.  Hate it.  I want the nice person who sent me a book to look as good as possible.  For a long time I was mildly nervous when a negative review issued, and it didn't help that some authors were real bullies about it.  I've seen some trash reviewers on their blogs, read by hundreds of fans, and organize a virtual witch hunt all over a well meaning 3/3 or something.  It's just not a fun thing to do.  It also can make it impossible to ever get a review copy.  Why am I telling you this?<br/><br/>If someone writes a negative review then here is your chance to convert them.  After a "Thanks for the review" and some friendly, but on point responses you'll at least look good to the community.  It's entirely possible, too, that that reviewer will enjoy the interaction and be more favorably disposed towards your future works.  I'm not saying you should be happy about it, necessarily, but the same friendly attitude that will keep favorable reviews coming forward may also turn someone who dislikes your products into a fan.<br/><br/>In conclusion: Say "Thanks!"  Consider keeping them in the loop on your future products.  A personal email and a public thanks are both useful.  Try to approach negative reviews with the same positive attitude as positive reviews.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112722/#Comment_112722" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T09:33:39+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  9:33AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam I Am</cite><br/>when I didn't ask for it or if the makers didn't say, "Hey, you wanna review my product?" first.

I think some of the site's posters were a little skeptical, and I'm not sure any reviews issued from the offer.<br/><br/>I think that if you're going to do this you need to be clear and confidant in how you present it, and there need to be no uncertain terms about the offer of compensation.  Linking to successful reviews, as they occur, is an excellent idea because it assures other folk that you follow through on the promise.  What would really rock would be, if you're working with IPR or just have a bunch of friends who also publish games, to offer product instead of money as compensation.  It puts another game in the hands of someone who has reviewed and stops the problem of 'paying for reviews'.<br/><br/>Be prepared to take a little bit of flak for "paying for reviews."  I know that conceptually it's like comping a product, but real money is changing hands here after a review.  Some observers might look down on that, or even criticize it on the grounds that folk writing with the expectation of later compensation are writing much more favorable rewards than they would otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112748/#Comment_112748" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T10:21:50+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 10:21AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2007 4:11PM by Anemone.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unsurprisingly, Chris Richeson captured the subject perfectly, in my opinion.  I'll add a couple of comments:<br/><br/>(1) <b>Happy Ratings.</b>  Like Chris, I don't like giving a bad mark to a product.  For one thing, I exchange with a lot of very nice authors, and it's not a fun thing to have to say "You're great, but your game isn't."  For another, I concentrate on actual play reviews, and I don't really want to play games that are less that satisfying just so I can review them.  For a third, even games I've detested have tons of fans, and some of those are very smart people; it does give me pause and makes me think maybe I'm not a good judge of those systems.<br/><br/><b>However</b>...  I really wish people didn't dial the ratings up all the time.  It's getting to the point where giving less than a perfect score is an insult.  Really, a game can be a fine game and well worth buying and playing, and collect a "3 out of 5" rating.  I give books I really love a 4 out of 5, because I like to reserve 5 for the truly special.  I think it's far more important to explain (and quickly sum up, for that thumbs-up, thumbs-down snapshot) what is good and less interesting about a book, and what play styles it suits.  <br/><br/>Of course, part of the problem is that a simple rating can't really capture breadth and depth; RPG.net tried to improve on the single score by distinguishing style and substance ratings, but even that has limited power.  For an elaborate and well-explained super-rating system, see Dan Davenport's reviews.<br/><br/>(2) <b>Objectivity and Incentives.</b> I'm very uncomfortable with incentives offered prior to writing a review, even just free copies of the game.  If I take something from an author or publisher, I am committing to giving something back.  Sometimes it's playtesting, sometimes it's review and comments on a beta version, sometimes it's proofreading.  But it's a clear exchange that benefits both of us (they get assistance, I get free gaming material).  For a review, though, I'm uncomfortable, not only because it may take me a long while before I write the review, but also because I'm wary of influencing the content of my reviews.  Am I "delivering" my part of the bargain if I post an uncomplimentary review?<br/><br/>So I vastly prefer the cases when I've won prizes for "best review" after the fact.  I had no external incentive except writing the best review I could, regardless of the product, and it was very pleasant to be acknowledged for it.  I also like the suggestion Chris expresses here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.W.Richeson</cite>Now, if I were a publisher I'd keep a list of names and email addresses of fans who reviewed my games in a positive light.  I'd then send them, at a minimum, a free PDF of my next product with a "Hey, thanks again for reviewing Awesome Game!  Here's a free copy of my new game.  If you have a chance to review it that would be wonderful, but if not please enjoy!"</blockquote>\nThat takes the pressure off the reviewer to produce a result; if s/he likes the new game, the review will probably appear anyway, but unconstrained -- "unbought".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112798/#Comment_112798" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T12:18:56+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 12:18PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I often request review copies of games I find interesting, or ones I think my audience will be interested in. Since I am writing both rpg and board game reviews on an average of about 6-8 a month, there can be a delay in me getting a game and it getting into my review cycle.<br/><br/>If I get a comp copy, it goes higher in the stack than a game I purchase for myself, mostly out of courtesy to the publisher who sent the copy. With role-playing games especially, it takes longer to do a review, because I am trying to get a good feel for the game, the setting, and then determine what might appeal to my rather general audience.<br/><br/>I try to let publishers know as soon as a review is published and then send them a print copy (paper clipping or issue of Graffiti, depending on where it ran). <br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112802/#Comment_112802" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T12:29:47+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 12:29PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, the more lengthy and complex the game, the more time it likely will take me. That also holds true for games that have very specific/niche audiences. If it is a game I don't like or don't think I can review, then I will let the publisher know and return the product. So far that only has happened once with some board games.<br/><br/>And just as a side note, Fred Hicks and Chad Underkoffler were the first two RPG publishers to send me review copies, and I loved their games. I give them press whenever I get the chance in part because of how much I adore their games, but also because they were very easy to work with and helped me out when I was first getting started with these columns.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112865/#Comment_112865" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T15:07:21+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  3:07PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>That's completely your decision as a publisher, and I think most people will - of course! - respect that.

There <i>is</i> another side to the issue. <br/><br/>When working at XX, at least one staff reviewer was found to be accepting payment (in the form of paid writing work) from a publisher in exchange for glowing reviews and another individual hired before I was employed at XX was suspected of such behavior when we found out that all of his contact info (save for his email address) was created from wholecloth -- and when he refused to provide any real, verifiable, contact info after being asked to do so. Both of these individuals were fired by me -- and both times I received some very threatening emails from the publishers whose products had been receiving the aformentioned glowing reviews. Which brings me to the other side of the issue. . . <br/><br/>There were certain publishers <i>demanding</i> that the staff reviewers of XX only write positive reviews, <i>regardless of actual product quality</i>. The level of moral flexibility displayed by certain publishers that I had admired going into the job really did a lot to foster my perception of small-press outfits as being whiny, unreasonable, and ravaged by self-entitlement issues. There were several publishers suggesting that they were entitled to a positive review in exchange for review copies and that <i>any</i> negative criticism was unacceptable (and some went so far as to say that if they received a negative review, they'd pull their products and go looking for reviews elsewhere). <br/><br/>Let's just say that I got to see a real ugly side of the hobby industry when working at XX. During my stint with XX, I didn't ever see XX owners bow to the kinds of demands that these unscrupuolous publishers were making, though I often wondered if deals like this weren't being struck at other review/fan sites due the common threat of "going elsewhere" for service. At any rate, the point is, sometimes publishers are petty, unreasonable, and wholly dishonest when it comes to products being reviewed honestly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112870/#Comment_112870" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T15:48:03+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  3:48PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can't blame a publisher for only wanting to provide review copies to folk that like their stuff, but yeah that's way overboard.<br/><br/>The two times I asked WotC for review copies they referred me to a third party marketing company that they use to screen potential reviewers.

All the products I've reviewed up to this point on the show have been paid for out of my own pocket (or my co-host's).  It also matches with my preference to only review products on the show which we consider interesting, noteworthy, or just darned good. Not every review or product is an A+, of course, but I deliberately wanted to focus on the positive side of things.<br/><br/>We're actually now accepting review copies for the show, with a few caveats.  First, it's on an inquiry basis - we're generally not out looking to score freebies, and we wouldn't want publishers just sending us stuff in hopes.  Second, I tell publishers - prior to being sent a review copy - that I'm only going to do a review on the show if I think the product is good, noteworthy, etc.  This means if I just plain didn't like it, I'm not going to pan it on the air.  Otherwise, my feeling is that if I accept a review copy, a review should be forthcoming.  Part of the intent in making it inquiry is to avoid an even larger pile to material to slog through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112874/#Comment_112874" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T16:01:06+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  4:01PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2007 4:03PM by jdrakeh.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.W.Richeson</cite>You can't blame a publisher for only wanting to provide review copies to folk that like their stuff. . . </blockquote>\nNo, of course not.

I print the URL of the game's website on the character sheets that I hand out. After the game session, I tell people why I love the game. I've driven one sale that I know of to the designer and perhaps two other sales. <br/><br/>I don't want anything for doing that. Well, nothing except to get more players jazzed about the game so I can have more people to play the game with. While it's cool that you'd send me a PDF copy of your next game, or a discount code from your online store, or even take the time to write me an e-mail thanking me for my game evangelizing, it's fine. I'm just happy about your game and want to tell other people about it.<br/><br/>Chances are, I'm going to come back and purchase your next offering. If you send me a free copy because I gave a positive review of your last offering, you're just losing out on a $20 to $45 sale. If I like the next offering, I'm going to enthuse about it all over the place, driving the same amount of sales to you.<br/><br/>If you really want to thank me for the evangelizing, just shoot me an e-mail saying so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112903/#Comment_112903" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T17:54:26+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  5:54PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I could care less if a reviewer made a positive review or negative review about one of our products. I've never tried to play up positive reviews aspect as a marketing ploy. Mentions on the market, good or bad, is fine by me. Both can work well to market a product, so long as the review was done well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I absolutely hate in reviews is when a reviewer gets a product (however they get it), then review a game without having read it. I once had a board game reviewed when reading the review it was abundantly clear the reviewer had never even opened the box, much less read the rules or played the game. Games are meant to be played and I personally feel any review of a game product that does not have how the game plays as being central to the review is just a perfectly good waste of words. They are next to useless. When I see such a review I have a tendency to challenge the reviewer to illustrate thety clearly did not play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

It is a waste of a column for me to tell a bunch of people who have little idea what kind of board/card/roleplaying games are out there "stay away from this, it's crap," because chances are they wouldn't have thought about buying that game in the first place, or even known it existed.<br/><br/>That having been said, my reviews are still critical. I've had a couple of games that I liked, but I warned people up front they were more for mature players, or they would take some work (I think my review of <b>Colonial Gothic</b> is a good example of that. I said I loved the idea but the book felt incomplete because it fell flat on the supernatural aspects. I said something similar about <b>DragonMech</b>: Interesting ideas, but needed a lot of GM work to be playable, in my opinion.)<br/><br/>Most times I am trying to give readers a brief idea of the game mechanics and then telling them a couple of things I really enjoyed about the game. I think that does more good than spending 20 inches of text bashing a game. I would rather just send it back to the publisher. <br/><br/>Also, one other thing: I am <i>required</i> to write x number of reviews, because that is space in those publications that needs to be filled with content (and I thank God daily they are allowing me to fill that space with <i>this</i> content), but I get paid nothing extra for those reviews. It is at my expense on my time. Since I don't get reimbursed for copies of games, I couldn't do these review columns without receiving review copies, and I still buy and review games I can't get for free, or that I personally want. <br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112973/#Comment_112973" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T10:23:11+00:00" title="December  8, 2007 10:23AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, this is a counterpart to some of the threads we've had on professional publishers versus hobbyist publishers (except no flames yet).  This is professional reviewers versus amateur reviewers.  Unlike movies, books, restaurants, music, etc., RPGs don't have the volume for reviewers to make a living on them, just like relatively few authors and publishers make a living strictly with RPGs.  <br/><br/>The closest we come to professional reviewers are people like Ken Hite (who also writes), Michael Erb, Chris Richeson, Dan Davenport, etc.  In other circles, they might be considered semi-pro.  Most of the rest of us are amateurs, who vary in enthusiasm, energy, availability, and writing skills.  I think the advice given by Fred Hicks up-thread is excellent: publishers should look around at good and reliable reviewers, knowing even the best are still hobbyists and semi-pros, and concentrate on them.  <br/><br/>But that does mean you have to spend a portion of your time looking at other games' reviews to figure out what reviewers are currently active and what new talent in this area has recently appeared on the scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113110/#Comment_113110" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T09:46:12+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  9:46AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My formula's pretty simple.<br/><br/>What's the intrinsic advertising value of the person who's offering to do the review?<br/><br/>Is it greater than my unit print cost plus shipping?  If so, I'll mail them a physical copy.  <br/>-- Note: very few reviewers fit this bill, though sometimes I give folks some "bonus dollars" of value because I want to experiment with 'em.  Michael Erb was initially in this category, because I wanted to experiment with getting a review in a print-media newspaper.  But he's been a great promoter of my stuff since, so I definitely made the ad-value back on the risk I took, and he no longer needs the "bonus" to make this a yes.<br/><br/>Is it greater than my PDF cost?  If yes, then I'll hook them up with a PDF.  <br/>-- For me, I view PDFs as very easy to consider free -- in that I think of them as gateways to potentially getting folks to buy the print version.  At the very least, the incidence of piracy makes me feel pretty blase about handing out comp PDFs.  So I'm pretty free &amp; easy about doing this.  Not every publisher is, nor should every publisher be.<br/><br/>So how do I arrive at the intrinsic advertising value?  Simply put, track record.  Chris Richeson got very far with me by building a track record that I felt was of high value to me as a small press publisher.  So he got the physical copy, easy.  Michael Erb hadn't built up a strong online footprint at the time he asked for comps.  But I was willing to go a few bonus bucks on there because he brought along an unusual opportunity.  Folks who offered to review Don't Rest Your Head for RPG.net Horror Week got the PDF -- by desiring participation in the event, they at least pegged into my "PDF class" of reviewers.  It's really a very simple process, and one which you can usually rely on your gut.<br/><br/>I'd never, ever get into the whole "I'll reimburse you" thing that Andy's suggesting.  Too much work for me, which reduces its value as a strategy completely.  I prefer unidirectional transactions if I can manage it. "Tell you what, I'll send you the PDF for free.  If you want to review it in print, you'll have to buy it, but consider the gratis PDF to be an opportunity to decide whether it's worth your money first."  This has the added benefit of coming off like I'm concerned for them spending their gaming dollar effectively.  When I say, in my messages to a potential reviewer, "I care about you," that reviewer's going to feel positive about me, and potentially positive about the product.  It's a good play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113112/#Comment_113112" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T09:55:58+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  9:55AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On saying "Thank you":<br/><br/>You absolutely have to do that, all the time.
