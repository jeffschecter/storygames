As Deleuze and Guattari once suggested, everyone wants to be a fascist because everyone wants to fuck their mother.<br/><br/>I'd say that the indie scene was as much a part of that mindset as mainstream gaming.</blockquote>\nI think it may have been Judd who, in the tone discussion for Flaming Taft, said, 'I don't want to be in another game where I fuck my mother.' And one of my wife's professors once said to her that 'repression is good - otherwise we'd all be fucking our grandmothers.' (I paraphrase in both cases).<br/><br/>That said, I also don't see as there's anything particularly wrong with the occasional engagement with your fantasies, power or otherwise. Isn't it the hallmark of liberalism to be able to do so? It seems perculiarly catholic to conflate the deed and the thought.<br/><br/>I'm pretty happy to accept that much mainstream gaming is associated with power fantasies (although probably not Call of Cthulhu much at all or Traveller quite so much) but it seems to me that one of the strengths of Indie gaming is the variety of experience it produces. Steal Away Jordan, Dogs in the Vineyard, Grey Ranks and others give rise to much more complex character motivations<br/><br/>But is it ever possible to play Heroic Fantasy without it being a fantasy of murderous heroism?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197143/#Comment_197143" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T06:27:10+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  6:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost Dogs games I was in also had way less blood shed than you might expect from reading the majority of APs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197144/#Comment_197144" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T06:32:04+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  6:32AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            someone one enworld was just posting about how he hated that D&amp;D players continually think that heroism can only be achieved with xp and BIGGER magic items.<br><br>another post addressed how D&amp;D is nothing more than a game about killing creatures that do not share your world view.<br/><br/>there's some correlation there to what you're saying, but i've been up for 40 hours straight, so what do i know?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197145/#Comment_197145" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T06:32:45+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  6:32AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who knows? Seriously, this is one of those arguments that's consumed literary criticism for decades without being settled, and we won't settle it here. Is heroic narrative inherently fascistic? Maybe.<br/><br/>Fro my own purposes, though, I'll say that I don't find it necessarily so - at least not in a fatal way. The appeal of the heroic fantasy is precisely its unreality: because we live in a world in which good and evil are not simple binaries, and violence rarely (if ever) solves more problems than it creates, where the individual is usually powerless to effect meaningful change... the fantasy of a world in which this is not so is profoundly consolatory. Mistaking that fantasy for a representation of reality - or of how things "ought" to be - is probably a pretty bad idea, but I don't see the enjoyment of the fantasy as problematic. I fantasize about plenty of things that would be really bad ideas in the real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197148/#Comment_197148" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T06:40:02+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  6:40AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2009 10:13AM by Graham.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, I'm not sure it is.

Violence is an extremely game-able conflict:  it's high stakes, it's fast paced, there are clear winners and losers, and everyone can participate simultaneously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS" title="timeLESS"><img alt="timeLESS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i253.photobucket.com/albums/hh79/gamestribe/cthulhumobster.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS">timeLESS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197157/#Comment_197157" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T07:25:31+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  7:25AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heroic Fantasy is not inherently fascistic at all.

In lots of tribal stories  "Overcoming" was done by tricking and/or Outsmarting the thing that needed to be overcome.

Start counting how many badguys are overcome by the goodguys taking pointy things and stabbing the badguys until they're dead.  You may be surprised by how rare that "solution" actually is.  It is far more likely that badguys are run off, tricked into the jaws of their own monsters, redeemed by seeing the light, or trapped within the mystic crystal prison.  Or my personal favorite, fall to their deaths because while dangling from the parapets, they refused to take the goodguy's hand and try instead for one last stab.  It's almost distressingly rare that the goodguy actually kills the badguy.<br/><br/>Except in RPGs.  I suspect this is for two reasons.<br/><br/>The first is that most RPGs give the PCs a hammer, and then every problem looks like a nail.  If the only mechanical option I have for solving problems is by killing the people behind the problems, well then, I'm going to be doing a lot of killing, aren't I?<br/><br/>The other reason is less of a design flaw and actually somewhat positive: RPGs are more honest than mass media.  RPGs allow their protagonists to judge the antagonists and act accordingly.  Mass media does not allow its protagonists to do anything objectionable, which includes righteous execution of evil-doers, because, you know, killing is always reprehensible*.  By contrast, your game of Dogs or whatever is for you and your table's entertainment, so nobody feels the need to water down what happens for the benefit of children who might sneak into the movie theater.  This results in, I believe, a far more genuine and honest address of theme.<br/><br/>Now then, for my money, you get the best results when you fix Reason One while retaining Reason Two.  As long as there are, generally speaking, viable alternatives to violence while there is still the possibility of violence being used, you end up with a result where, when violence is used, it creates a powerful statement.  You step away from "all badguys must die" and get to the golden stuff: "this guy was so bad he needed to die," "this protagonist was too filled with rage to use a non-violent solution," "there wasn't time to solve this other than messily," and so on.<br/><br/>You also get repercussions and consequences of those statements \u2014 contrast with a game where violence is the only possible solution, where those "consequences" are pale, limp, and pathetic baiting on the part of the GM.  There, it's not a consequence of what you chose to do, it's a consequence of playing the game.  How much cooler is it when you face a consequence of your choice, rather than a consequence of participation?<br/><br/>* another rant for another time                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197230/#Comment_197230" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T13:36:30+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  1:36PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe what I said was, "I don't want to play a game where I kill my mother."

Steal Away Jordan, Dogs in the Vineyard, Grey Ranks and others give rise to much more complex character motivations<br/><br/>But is it ever possible to play Heroic Fantasy without it being a fantasy of murderous heroism?</blockquote>\nI guess I'm just stupid....<br/><br/>All the  time I hear "system matters". Fine I actually happen to agree with it, with the reservation that sometimes I think folks take the screed too seriously and ther's some wiggle room.<br/><br/>Since D&amp;D seems to be what prompted this, let me ask...  did D&amp;D suddeny stop being about killing things and taking their stuff?<br/><br/>What people are calling heroic fantasy is stuff that's about killing and taking stuff in the first place.<br/><br/>Does all fantasy have to be that way? No.  I'm pretty sure you can find people playing Lord of the Rings and it's not about killing everything they come across. In fact, most of the LotR stuff I hear about is people being smug about how it's completely "opposite" to D&amp;D. <br/><br/>Asking if heroic fantasy games have to be about muderous heroism seems to me to be an awful lot like asking, "do spy games have to be all about scoring with women and tech-porn, like some sort of James Bond movie?"<br/><br/>Small press/indy games are groovy. But it's not like 30+ years of rpgs have gone by with people only killing things and taking stuff, and it took the promised prophets of small press to lead a chosen group of people out of the desert and into the promised gaming lands. Peple can make just as deep and rich characters in D&amp;D as they can some other game.<br/><br/>So.... what is it I'm missing? What heroic fantasy games are out there that weren't created with the premise of killing things and taking their stuff, that were then turned into these horrible power-fantasy games of murder and looting?<br/><br/>Edit: It's not that I'm some dude that hangs out playing D&amp;D all the time. I just don't get this factionalization thing that gamers seem to be into. If it's not crapping all over Palladium, then it's some stupid edition war, or it's "traditional" vs "indy" gaming. I'm some sort of freak apparently that just plays games and hangs out with people I like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
