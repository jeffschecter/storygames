I have the Synthesis and Sundering stunts done, but I'm looking for feedback on Technosmithing. Since I might get the attention of fellow T8 and FATE lovers here, I figured I'd ask.<br/><br/>Basically, Engineering and Science in Spirit of the Century encompass much of what Technosmithing does (and more). The "and more" part I like, I think a lot of the existing Stunts add a lot of character to Keepers. However, unlike Sundering and Synthesis, Technosmithing does not have any obvious trappings to justify a skill as its own. And Engineering and Science a) take away some of the quasi-mystical edge from Technosmithing and b) seem like overkill for Tribe 8's setting.<br/><br/>So what I'm wondering...wrap some of Science and Engineering into one skill called Technosmithing? Just make up the Stunts that Technosmithing has beyond Science and Engineering Stunts and call it a day?<br/><br/>Just an FYI, I've already replaced Academics (and parts of Science) with a skill called Lore plus including a skill called Craft for some of the Engineering related stuff that the Tribes would be capable of. As such, I'm not necessarily interested in keeping the existing Science/Engineering breakdown as I think it's pretty irrelevant to Tribe 8; I'm heavily leaning towards blending most of the trappings of Science and Engineering into Technosmithing. To me this is good, because it makes the technological Keeper stuff even more "mystical" than the "I have x, y and z tech skills and Technosmithing." Technosmithing *is* tech skills. I just want to hear what others think of the idea.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72461/#Comment_72461" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T13:56:57+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  1:56PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd ditch Science and Engineering in favor of Technosmithing, but this does beg the question: can I then have ratings in Synthesis <em>and</em> Technosmithing?

There are also stunt requirements, with aspect requirements as well, which makes it pretty steep for any character to branch out. For example, a Fallen or Tribal character is going to at least one aspect (and probably two) related to their Tribe or Outlook. In order to learn Synthesis, they have to take the Synthesis skill and then two stunts (Eminence and Conjunction) in order to accomplish what a Synthesis user can in Silhouette. To learn Sundering, there would need to be an aspect related to how they learned it; plus taking the Sundering skill, plus any additional stunts they need to take (2 minimum to be able to do anything useful). So now we have a character with a minimum of two aspects, two skill choices and four stunt slots taken up to be a "dual wielder" - and Tribe 8 characters have fewer aspects, Stunt slots and skills than their SoTC counterparts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72479/#Comment_72479" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T15:04:59+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  3:04PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah ha.

I'll throw some of the stuff up that I have once I get the Technosmithing hammered out. After that I have a couple tasks that shouldn't be too hard:<br/><br/>1) I may develop spiritual combat a bit more.<br/>2) I want to develop a rough barter system that takes advantage of FATE. I might even include a Barter stress track (after a hard day of fighting Z'bri and taking a mild consequence, you are forced to concede to a merchant wanting to trade you stickybuns for the trophy you took! Can't...resist...stickybuns...).<br/>3) I need to weed out the "regular" Stunts that don't apply to Tribe 8 and write a few new ones.<br/>4) Periphery stuff such as the phases, skill pyramid, some resource costs, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72555/#Comment_72555" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T19:55:51+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  7:55PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coolness. <br/><br/>I'm to out of my brain right now to be helpful, but I like the sounds of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/binarysins" title="binarysins"><img alt="binarysins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/binarysins">binarysins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72570/#Comment_72570" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T22:12:09+00:00" title="May 29, 2007 10:12PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I finished Technosmithing.

This should be enough to get most people started since anyone with a good head for Tribe 8 is going to be able to cobble together the rest of the bits and pieces. Now that the hard part is mostly done (a lot of the descriptions are rather vague, I figure I need to playtest to really tweak them out), I'm going to move forward on stuff like phases, revised Stunt lists, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
