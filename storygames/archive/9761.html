I've seen it brought up in all kinds of positive lights and I don't think I've ever seen a bad word about it here (this might be a case of selective perception). For me, this is surprising, since I'm coming from a game design culture where this sort of mechanic is considered Bad Design and the advice is something like "No. Seriously, don't do it. It'll ruin the game." (and THAT is a case of hyperbole. Exagerrations makes it fun, shuddup). So naturally, I have to ask you guys: why doesn't fanmail suck?<br/><br/>Notice that I'm assuming it doesn't suck and I need you to tell me why. This is not a claim that it does suck. I still haven't played PTA, but I've played some games with fanmailesque systems and I've seen all of the behaviors associated with this type of mechanic from the design culture I'm from If there's a shy or inhibited person in the group one of the following things happen:<br/><br/>* The player gets a lot less fanmail than the others, because he's not bringing as much awesome. The player notices this and is not having fun, since it lowers his self esteem.<br/>* The player does get as much fanmail as the others because the threshold of awesome is lower for that player. He gets fanmail for things that others wouldn't get fanmail for. Everyone at the table knows this, and it lowers his self esteem since he doesn't feel he "deserves" it.<br/><br/>I've seen borth these behasviors in play and it's not fun. The fanmailesque systems I've tried (remember, I haven't played PTA) tend to call attention to the fact that the low-key player doesn't stand up and shout the way the others do and it makes him feel like he's not awesome. It establishes an atmosphere of competition instead of one of relaxation and fun.<br/><br/>So what does PTA do to prevent this? Or is it just that I've played with dysfunctional groups? Has this sort of thing ever happened at your table? If not, why? What prevents it from happening? How come fanmail isn't just rewarding the people who are already hogging the spotlight?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216631/#Comment_216631" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T10:18:42+00:00" title="July  6, 2009 10:18AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>Can you name some of the games that have the "fanmailesque" systems?

These other "fanmailesque" games might not actually get it right.<br/><br/>But, beyond that, I wonder if the very construct of PTA allows this to happen when it would break in other games. Beyond the player-rewarded-only factor (which can engender mutualism in non-dickish players), there's the fact that the conceit supports this -- hey, someone just sent you fan mail for your awesome scene. It's less conceit-breaking than, say, a pulp action game where you reward each other for being awesome, or something like that.<br/><br/>Furthermore, because of how PTA distributes spotlight -- every player has one turn that is inherently their spotlight and can regulate who is in it -- then you don't have "that one guy hogging spotlight" problems unless, frankly, everyone wants that guy in their scene. In which case, you're actually playing the game right still.  In games where the spotlight is largely determined by the GM or by the loudest player, I can see where you would have the problems you're talking about.<br/><br/>(Yes, one can use fanmail to buy into other scenes he wasn't invited into, but if constantly done and if done in an unwelcome way, such a player won't keep getting fanmail. You give fanmail for what you want to see, not what you don't.)<br/><br/>In short, Fanmail doesn't exist in a vacuum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216640/#Comment_216640" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T10:32:51+00:00" title="July  6, 2009 10:32AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, two things.

This keeps it out of the "dance, monkey, dance!" category in an elegant way.  It also means that for maximum fun, the fanmail must flow, and engaged players have to look for opportunities to give it away.  If you are playing with people you like and trust, you find those opportunities in the play of all your friends.  It helps that each piece of the exchange - giving, receiving, and using fanmail - is very satisfying.<br/><br/>Worrying about whether you deserve the fanmail your friends are giving you is pretty counter-productive.  Your friends love you and want to have fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216642/#Comment_216642" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T10:35:33+00:00" title="July  6, 2009 10:35AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>However, that dovetails into my second point.

Sometimes people get more comfortable with showing their go-gettery-ness later, once they know and trust people more. Some people cannot, ever.<br/><br/>In fact, I Produced two crash-and-burn scenarios at the same <a href="http://dexposure.com/" rel="nofollow">Double Exposure</a> convention (the people who put on Dreamation and DexCon). In each, there was a player whose play style interacted with the game to grind it to a halt. One was a very nice, creative, cool guy who just locked up in fear when it was his turn to be spotlighted or to frame a scene. Another was a loud prick who started off the session by saying he hated television, and thought that RPGs and television were absolute opposites and irreconcilable.<br/><br/>Guy one responded to our offers to help unstick him gratefully and was overly apologetic, for which we were all "don't be silly, it's no bother."

I play with some quiet/thinky people and PTA works well when we give them space to think and reward the quiet, which tends to add a lot as a palate cleanser to all the chest pounding.  Like all things, I suspect this is group dependent.  For this reason and others I would never run PTA at a con, but it happens with great success pretty regularly, so there's that.<br/><br/>Matt, fanmail is a small thing mechanically, but as a procedure it really stands out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216674/#Comment_216674" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T12:11:43+00:00" title="July  6, 2009 12:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, a few things:<br/><br/>1. If you don't give out enough fanmail, like Jason says, the game grinds to a sputter.  I've watched it happen multiple times, so it definitely sucks in that case.<br/><br/>2. Sometimes fanmail economies (or any other "resource point for doing X" economies) become, um, tornados of "awesome escalation," where people try to competitively out-awesome each other in an ascending cacophony of over-the-top description. Unless this is specifically what you want (frex: Danger Patrol), this can totally suck, turning your orchestra into a monkey bashing the same note on a piano, over and over again.  Even the better games that strive for awesome cacophony, like Danger Patrol, benefit from things like refresh scenes and other stuff that tones things back down a bit occasionally.<br/><br/>3. Fanmail is totally a social contract level thing.  As such, what earns a player fanmail varies massively from group to group and even session to session.  For example, if Jason and I are throwing down in a TV show inspired by The Wire, I can give him fanmail for doing something really subtle with his characterization, something that's not "awesome" in the gonzo sense.  Maybe he just pauses dramatically in the middle of this one line or something.  This is something even shy players can do, right?  Fanmail doesn't have to be about doing something punchy or dramatic that captures the spotlight for yourself.<br/><br/>4. As other folks have mentioned, rotating scene framing and rotating spotlight helps spread the love around.  Generally, I find that players earn the most fanmail during their spotlight episode which they then spend at the end of the episode to resolve their personal crisis.  Also, I find that shyer players often enjoy how PTA allows them to play supporting roles, instead of making them feel bad because they're not stepping forward and contributing more.<br/><br/>5. Ultimately, PTA (like any game) is only going to be as functional as your group of players is.  If you have a shyer player, it's the responsibility of the group to come up with ways to include them while not being condescending or putting them uncomfortably on the spot.  But I don't think the fanmail economy or any other part of PTA makes this any harder that it would be in other games, necessarily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216678/#Comment_216678" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T12:30:51+00:00" title="July  6, 2009 12:30PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2009 12:31PM by Moreno R..">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) PTA is non competitive. The characters don't have a hp box, they can't be killed by anyone except their player, there is simply NO WAY to deprotagonize a character: the player will always have his/her scene. So, fan mail is not useful to survive or to "win", the most pronounced effect in game is that people with more fan mail play more and their ideas get used more often.<br/><br/>2) PTA that is not used is wasted. When people understand this, they give fan mail every time they can, so it's not a matter of "should I give FM to someone?"  as much of "who I will give fan mail to?"<br/><br/>3) Fan mail is not given with "cool moves" or something like that, that can turn a game in a boring show of muscles. Fan mail is given for anything, anything at all, that you enjoy. So, the often stated (by people who never played it) "risk" of having people hog the attention to get fan mail, doesn't exist. If someone hog in a boring way, he will not get fan mail. it will get it only if he is truly funny. So, even the shy player will get a lot of fan mail if he play with the rest of the group instead of turtling. Fan mail work because it "attune" the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216692/#Comment_216692" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T12:59:21+00:00" title="July  6, 2009 12:59PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, when i ran PTA for the first time, I had exactly the same concerns about PTA fan mail.

I think in part it's because I see as part of my responsibility as game host as being helping to involve the shy/introvert-players, so they never get overlooked, but also, I didn't feel the need to do much of that sort in PTA. It has spotlight sharing built in, in a marvellous way, so that even the quiet players always get their moments in the spotlight, without being freaked out by it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm another who thinks there's no reason quiet or reserved players should bring a game of PTA to a grinding halt - the idea sounds bizarre to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still wary of fan mail-esque mechanics in other systems, but it really works in PTA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216701/#Comment_216701" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T13:14:29+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  1:14PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>First, as Ryan notes, the spotlight system means that certain people are more important for an entire episode than other people.

This thread has some good stuff in it, but I feel I need to clarify something. The issue here is not that someone would hog the spotlight to do stuff that's not appreciated around the table. It's the other way around. Some guy at the table is simply "better" at PTA than someone else. He comes up with awesome plot twists, he makes funny in-character jokes, he narrates things colorfully and vividly ... In that other thread about bad gaming habits, a lot of people confessed their spotlight-hoggingness, but I don't believe for a second that they (or we, as I do it myself at times) do anything but great stuff with the spotlight. The issue would be that someone is not as colorful, not as engaged, not as awesome as the others, where "awesome" means anything considered positive by the group. That's the issue and that's where the two things I mentioned in the original post can occurr.<br><br>I also want to reiterate that the question is NOT "is fanmail broken"? but rather "how come it's not?". PTA clearly works (although a few people have said that it doesn't work well with shy people. I'm interested in hearing more about that), but why does it? If I want to design a fanmail system, what do I need to do to make sure it doesn't put focus on the players' differing abilities of bringing the awesome? Is it the fact that everybody gets a scene? Is it the spotlight episodes? Or what?<br><br>Or we could phrase it like this: if there's a player at the table who's not coming up with the brilliant twists, who doesn't do the dramatic pauses, who can't come up with cool descriptions as well as the others, what happens? Does the player get as much fanmail as the others anyway? Does he get less, but it doesn't matter?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216713/#Comment_216713" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T13:54:26+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  1:54PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2009 1:55PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not everyone who is a spotlight hog does great things with it.

I've been in games where some people get rewarded more than me, and the only times it bothers me is when I'm having a crappy day and what I really need is a hug.<br/><br/>I think the reason why fan mail is not broken is because it's generally played by well-adjusted people who want everyone to have fun and enjoy riffing off each other. That's not to be glib. The only reason I can see fanmail succumbing to your concerns is if it's being played by people who have problems beyond what game they decided to play that night. I just have never had anyone in my game who didn't, at some point, come up with a handful of cool ideas that I wanted to reward him/her for that I wanted to be playing with in the first place.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216715/#Comment_216715" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T14:06:44+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  2:06PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>It seems like you're not satisfied with the answers we've come up with. Unfortunately, other than boiling it down to "PTA promotes (and I think requires) a particular sort of social contract involving supportive, enforced collaboration that isn't found it a lot of other games," I don't know what more we can tell you. The questions you ask are akin to "Is D&amp;D broken if one of the players doesn't know the rules well and makes non-optimal decisions?" The answer is a complicated "yes and no..." -- yes, it's an instance of broken play for that person, but it's not a broken game as a whole outside of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216717/#Comment_216717" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T14:13:28+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  2:13PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fan mail is not a good idea if your group's unspoken social rules include something along the lines of "everybody is a special snowflake, and roleplaying is not a performance sport, and everybody is absolutely equal in everything all the time ever". For groups that are comfortable with the fact that some people have more of the skills used in roleplaying Fan mail is not a problem, as the physical evidence of piling tokens does not contradict their values. For those who do not want to draw attention to the fact that Jimmy there at the end of the table is not the sharpest knife in the drawer and most of the time we don't even really understand what he's getting out of hanging with us, it can be very painful and embarrassing to play a game like Primetime Adventures where you're asked to constantly judge the contributions others make. It's no wonder if the conclusion in that situation is that the Fan mail system is not fun or it doesn't work or it's unfair because it overruns the players who don't know how to play it.<br/><br/>I've seen both sorts of groups, so the phenomenon is real. I myself actively foster the realistic viewpoint, mostly because I personally consider the other some sort of geek atavism that can just go and die - it isn't doing anything good for the hobby to pretend that anything you do is OK and worthy of praise, you can't ever get better in what you do than the next guy (or yourself at this moment), it's a taboo to criticize another's contribution to the game and so on. It's not an interesting or constructive viewpoint on this whole thing we do.<br/><br/>Does that address your concerns, Simon? It seemed to me like you were dancing around this issue without quite putting it to words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216718/#Comment_216718" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T14:16:44+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  2:16PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, I am a better roleplayer than Eero, and my group always gives me more fanmail than they give him. <br/><br/>(That he is not in the game is beside the point.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216719/#Comment_216719" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T14:18:21+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  2:18PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>I still don't know what you think fanmail is, since I don't know the context you're using techniques like this, but I want to say one thing quickly:<br/><br/>Fanmail in PtA is never about putting a player on the spot.  Unlike some games where you <i>have</i> to come with the clever bit that justifies the use of a trait/benny/taking an action, PtA Fanmail is is produced when someone does something interesting.  Someone says something that gets a smile or laugh or gasp or "gulp" from another player, and Fanmail is given.<br/><br/>This is why I don't think there's as much "choking" on Fanmail as some people fear.  The people who get Fanmail weren't trying to get Fanmail.  They were just talking.  And someone says, "Hey, I liked that.  Have some Fanmail."  <br/><br/>Because of this I've never seen it having any of the "dance monkey" qualities one might fear it to have.<br/><br/>So, that's one reason it doesn't suck: The whole process is spontaneous and never puts the focus on someone to be clever or creative "right now!"<br/><br/>Second:<br/><br/>Nor is it -- in any way -- a competition.<br/><br/>Moreover, people, I've noticed, tend to send Fanmail on a kind of curve.  If Jim doesn't say much, but every once in a while says something great, then he gets Fanmail.  If Nate is always boisterous and adding details, he won't always get Fanmail.  In fact, it's when Nate does something new and fresh for Nate that will often get him the Fanmail.<br/><br/>So, here's another reason it doesn't suck:  In the context of PtA making stuff up is the name of the game.  (Not so much the manipulation of cleaver mechanics.)  From character creation forward it trains the players in a session to look for details and bits of fiction and so on... Fanmail is only half-about saying something fun.  The other half is about the other players getting used to listening for details that seem right and pleasing and saying, "Yes, Fanmail!"<br/><br/>The mechanic, in this specific game, in the context of how character creation is set up and how conflict is resolved, is about building conceptual and fictional material the group finds pleasing.  Once that gets cranked up, it has been my experience that even shy players jump on board.  They start talking -- and other people are listening -- and Fanmail moves across the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216725/#Comment_216725" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T14:40:10+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  2:40PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand's definitely better at getting fanmail from his group than me. The point is, I can live with the fact and form normal, healthy interrelationships with him and the other roleplayers who are also better or worse than me in different ways. When Brand gets all the fanmail in his game and I don't get any due to how I'm not even on the same continent, that doesn't bother met at all, because I can consider it an opportunity learn from the master. (I don't know, perhaps I should SHOW UP or something so I'd get fanmail?) Something like fanmail is just an alternative channel for displaying and affirming the relationships we already know are there if we only care to look: these guys play well together because they appreciate each other's contributions, that one is just here to warm the bench and eat the munchies, that one is shy and participates infrequently, but pays attention and contributes well when he does... these are all personal traits about which we can be frank - we don't have to pretend that everybody is the same in playing the game.<br/><br/>As an example (aside from my torrid affair with Brand), consider the fact that I've been playing roleplaying games with teenagers 15 years my junior for the last couple of years. Do you really think that everybody in those groups pretends to equality? It's pretty obvious where the social leadership resides when I basically teach the youngsters how to play roleplaying games. There are plenty of equal interactions, no doubt - the basic method of forming up the gaming groups already limits participation to those most inclined towards the artform. Still, just last night we had a session in which it was painfully obvious to everybody that a slightly younger member of the group wasn't performing to everybody else's level; we could handle that and teach him how to play dramatic games like TSoY (the game of the evening), we've done that before. In this sort of unequal social environment an open affirmation mechanic like fanmail is not a problem, because we already acknowledge all sorts of mentoring and partnering relationships. The things can be very different in a group where everybody is the same age and everybody is deeply invested in the geek idea that mere investment equates to a right to excel.<br/><br/>Also, what Christopher said is important: in PTA we reward relatively, it's a given that different people will get fanmail for different contributions. The guy who consistently produces good content will not get as much as his share of the content would indicate, because the other players come to expect that level of play from him and only reward him when he manages to hit a particularly high point. Meanwhile the slightly problematic young, inexperienced, shy, introverted, socially inept or otherwise handicapped guy will get fanmail for the least positive contribution simply because the players want to acknowledge contributions <i>relative</i> to what they expect, not relative to an universal metric. This is a very powerful feature, which basically means that everybody will get fan mail eventually - I've yet to play a full session with anyone who were so completely out of tune with the rest of the group that they'd never get a single point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216728/#Comment_216728" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T14:57:37+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  2:57PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think we just recognize the fact that everyone's different and we're pretty okay with that.

I think the biggest reason is the one CK states in post 27. Fan Mail becomes something that "just happens" - there's no keeping score, it becomes a natural part of the session that people don't think twice about. <br/>Also the way PTA apportions attention between players, the quiet ones always have moments where they are doing things that everyone else is forced to pay attention to, and no matter how quiet they are, if the GM is talking to them during their scene, and they are getting inmvolved in things, they WILL do things that get awarded fan mail. It won't be a pity award to stop them feeling left out, sp the negative side you mentioned earlier doesn't happen.<br/><br/>Fan Mail doesn't dominate play. it's not uintrusive - it's a subtle addition to play that adds spice, and helps get the group mutually supporting each other. In PTA it really works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216813/#Comment_216813" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T23:33:55+00:00" title="July  6, 2009 11:33PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, though fanmail is not without flaws, it has functioned very smoothly in the PtA games I've played in. If you're playing with a group of people who all know each other well and have played together before, it tends to be just like a "high-five" for doing something cool. Some nice recognition for doing what you always do anyway. In games where you don't all play together often, or where there are players that are new to the group or have less skill with narrative based games, the mechanic has an interesting effect. As Eero points out, the bar naturally starts to be raised for skilled players, who have to keep bringing more and more of what the group wants to get fanmail--which is very cool, because it tends to add a bit of challenge to the scene framing. The bar is naturally lowered for the shy or new player, so that any positive contribution is rewarded--which is also very cool, as it creates a feedback loop that builds confidence and promotes risk taking that results in more positive reaction in the form of additional fanmail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216817/#Comment_216817" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T00:15:46+00:00" title="July  7, 2009 12:15AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome.

They will get fanmail for being awesome relative to their normal level and that's okay.. It motivates them to reach higher. If they're insecure, they might not like that the fanmail system puts the focus on bringing the awesome and might not have fun. This is how fanmail works.<br/><br/>However, PTA also mitigates this by spotlight episodes and personal scenes, which encourages people to "come out of their shell" and be less insecure, since their ideas are taken seriously. This helps avoid that the abovementioned thing happens too often. It <i>can</i> still be a problem, but it rarely is, because of the spontaneous nature of it all.<br/><br/>In other words, fanmail might aggravate a problem that's already there, but if it is, you have a dysfunctional group. The experiences I've had with fanmailesque systems have all been at cons with mixed groups, where a well-olied functional group is not guaranteed. It might also have had to do with differing opinions on what's awesome. I might describe a bunch of rad ninja robots and the others think that's ruining our western. Again, that problem is in the group beforehand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216886/#Comment_216886" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T08:25:47+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  8:25AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good analysis.<br/><br/>One of my problems with Fanmail is that it rewards quick, conspicuous acts.

I have found that players who do not have a spotlight episode going on and have low scene presence get more fanmail, as they make more fruitful suggestions and play great back-up characters that rake in the fanmail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216891/#Comment_216891" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T08:33:25+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  8:33AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>One of my problems with Fanmail is that it rewards quick, conspicuous acts.

The only criterion is "you liked it".  So, it really reward ONLY what the group really like. <br/><br/>And, better still, it say to you what the other players like.

Doesn't mean that the quiet player won't get any fanmail at all, it just means that most of the time it'll be easier to reward the conspicuous player.<br/><br/>One of the great strengths about fanmail is that it can be handed out quickly without interrupting the flow of the game -- there's no negotiation for it, you just give the fanmail out.  If you're doing it with coins or poker chips, it's easy to just toss 'em over.  This puts, for good or ill, a feeling of immediacy to fanmail, a sense that you are giving it out for a specific act that rocks you back in your chair and makes you say "that was great!"  And with a quick, conspicuous moment of coolness, that's a match made in heaven: you see the cool thing happen, you flip the fanmail token to the person responsible, and no one asks "what was that for?" because it's all so gloriously apparent.  The moment and the mood coincide perfectly and awarding fanmail is easy.<br/><br/>When someone is being awesome in a quieter way, you might have the mood but not the moment -- no abrupt, obvious crystallizing act that tells you "yes, now is the time to give that person some fanmail."  You might go through several scenes before you realize that, hey, that character who isn't in the forefront of the scenes and isn't making a lot of noise is actually providing something really compelling that deserves fanmail, and, er, maybe it's time to give out some for it.<br/><br/><br/>Which is why really good fanmail-givers are the ones who pay attention to everyone, and think just as much about awarding fanmail for subtle but impressive things as they do for grandly obvious moments of coolness.  Get a whole bunch of people thinking like that, and the advantage that quick-and-conspicuous has tends to melt away.<br/><br/>edit:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>In my experience, that rewards active play, rather than more passive things such as listening and reacting.</blockquote>\nI tend to agree with you on this.<br/><br/>It's a shame, too, because everyone knows that the best conversation scenes in the best TV shows and movies are not about what one person is saying, it's about how the other person is reacting to what is being said.  Listening and reacting are the cornerstones of great dialogue, and they are immensely powerful: it's why Bob Newhart could be the funniest guy in a scene by literally giving everyone else all the jokes in the script, it's why two actors can make you believe that their characters are genuinely in love, it's what makes the villain's speech threatening and scary.  When you can't see the reactions of the other characters, the scene is crippled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216917/#Comment_216917" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T09:34:50+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  9:34AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is a thing about slow-building emotional moments or some scenes in detective movies and such.<br/><br/>Many a time many scenes aren't awesome.

Because, if they wanted to give me fan mail, they would. They would say, in your example:<br/><br/>"Sorry, Moreno, in our group, in our play, you made us enjoy the game more. The game was better, we want to give you fan mail. But we can't. Because, somewhere, there is Guy, who is afraid that someone, somewhere, would not give fan mail to someone he would. You see, his problem is that he doesn't think of himself playing PTA and giving fan mail for things he like. He thinks about ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE who play PTA, and he worry that they would enjoy something he wouldn't. He worry for some player, somewhere, who don't get fan mail. For this reason we can't improve our game as we would like"<br/><br/>Silly, right?<br/><br/>The problem in this thread is that I am talking about:<br/>I give fan mail for things I like ---&gt; I will get more things I like in my games ---&gt; my game will be better for us ----&gt; TOTAL WIN, because I care for our enjoyment<br/>while it seems you are talking about.<br/>People give fan mail for what they like ----&gt; but what they like, is what I like? ---&gt; their games woyld be less fun for me if they would give fan mail for what they like ----&gt; I worry. Someone somewhere is playing differently from me.<br/><br/>Let's me rephrase that. Another time.<br/><br/>I want to buy beer. So I buy the beer I like. I use money. It's like fan mail: I use it giving it to someone who sell me the beer I like. I get the beer I like.<br/><br/>And you are like: "but what if there is another beer, a better beer, that don't get brought?"<br/><br/>And I say "if that's a better beer, for me, I would buy that. What it's the problem?"<br/><br/>And you are like "So, you would buy that other beer, even if you prefer the first?"<br/><br/>Obviusly not. I would buy THE BEER I LIKE.<br/><br/>It seemed so simple to me. I don't really see why people are turning up tied in knots and problems about poor, poor people who don't get any fan mail....   the only people who never gets any fan mail, ever, are the obnoxious kind of players that we would not play with anyway. Even that is a problem?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216971/#Comment_216971" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T11:35:13+00:00" title="July  7, 2009 11:35AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216973/#Comment_216973" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T11:37:18+00:00" title="July  7, 2009 11:37AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2009 11:40AM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is probably an unintentional straw-men, I think you didn't get what I'm saying, and perhaps I didn't get what you were (above).<br/><br/>To me, the solution you proposed above, and my comments, let's all assume they are in our group, each person in their group.<br/>If I see something I like, then I give fanmail. All cool.<br/><br/>I read you above as saying, that a solution to a game where one player, or several, keep coming out with cool things (things we in the group find as cool), and one, or several, do not come up with cool things (as often), then the solution is to limit the amount of fanmail the super-active players can get?<br/><br/>Edit: I'll try to put it like this: It is not the problem that there is a player that is more active and will get more fanmail, the problem is not in the awesome player being awesome. The problem is in the players who not only don't come out of their shell, but delve deeper into it as a result of being brushed aside and/or "being put on the spot". So the solution of "One player is being awesome? Don't reward them for being awesome" is not a working solution, as it doesn't address the real issue. Nor is it a viable solution in most cases, as we punish the awesome player for being too awesome. And the beer analogy falls down.<br/>The problem is not having a cool player, but players who don't step up. We want to keep rewarding awesome player, and rewarding less-awesome players too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216976/#Comment_216976" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T11:42:06+00:00" title="July  7, 2009 11:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guy, to be asking for a solution implies that it's a problem.<br/><br/>I don't see a problem:  Some people get more fanmail than others.

So the effect will always be to improve the game. If there is one or more players that don't come up with "cool things" but we see them as good players, they will get fan mail.  Why they should not? Why should I reward some "cool things" if I think that the quiet player is more useful to the game? By the other hand, if the "quiet player" is simply turtling or is reading a comic book, why should he get fan mail? Why should we reward turtling?<br/>Fan mail will always go in the direction of what the players prefer, NOT what some other people, who is not playing, prefer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216996/#Comment_216996" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T12:17:49+00:00" title="July  7, 2009 12:17PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><br/>I give fan mail for things I like ---&gt; I will get more things I like in my games ---&gt; my game will be better for us ----&gt; TOTAL WIN, because I care for our enjoyment<br/></blockquote>\nVery cool! I never looked at fanmail that way. It's a regulating mechanism that guides group play toward what the individuals in the group like to see. I've certainly had the experience of playing PTA and enjoying someone else's contribution--and I wonder if the enjoyment and the gratification of giving (which is hardwired into our nervous systems) is just as rewarding as the the enjoyment of getting (which is also hardwired).

There is often more social reward for being the one cool enough to give someone fan mail than for being the one doing something cool enough to earn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, in games I've played where fan mail didn't flow, it wasn't because people were being shy...or didn't acknowledge the awesome.  Its because noone wanted to hog the "I'm cool because I gave fan mail" spot light, and we were all sitting around graciously letting someone else have the kudos for giving fan mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilly right...but I've seen it more often than other reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217013/#Comment_217013" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T13:05:08+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  1:05PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph... that is <b>so</b> silly.

If I'm watching a Battlestar Galactica episode where Starbuck flips out and kills somebody, I might not submit fan mail because I expect it from <i>that character</i>. However, when Cally suddenly produces a gun and plugs one of the core protagonists, <i>that's</i> worthy of fan mail. So not only does fan mail work on a player-player level, but more importantly on an audience-character level. I think this is important because it defuses the "you're just pandering to the weak player" argument - no, I'm rewarding a surprisingly cool scene involving a character who's commonly not blowing my socks off.<br><br>BSG fans will note I'm still plowing my way through Season Two.

It's because my brain is wired to respond to moving images. My behaviour is not entirely conscious, it is in part the result of other tendencies over which I have more or less control.<br/><br/>What I read Graham as saying is that people who take "quick, conspicuous acts" are <i>more noticeable</i> in the same way a moving image is more noticeable than a static one. It has absolutely nothing to do with conscious preference and everything to do with how people in general react to social interactions in general.<br/><br/>If I am flat out more likely to notice any quick, conspicuous act -- then I am more likely to consider it for conscious reward. The word 'subtle' means something, after all: it means <i>less frickin' noticeable</i>. Subtle acts will get rewarded less unless people consciously <i>compensate</i> for an unconscious effect by which their brain only selects a certain portion of events to react to. So yes, a group can consciously try and counteract the primacy of quick, conspicuous acts when it comes to rewarding Fan Mail -- but it is not a matter of simply choosing between two conscious preferences.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217047/#Comment_217047" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T14:30:19+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  2:30PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, comments 50-56 are about this point, minus Clinton's important contribution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217054/#Comment_217054" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T14:52:07+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  2:52PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>This statement is, to me, similar to the claim that drug addicts should just stop doing drugs, if they think being addicted to drugs is a problem.</blockquote>\nYou are addicted to giving fan mail, without thinking consciously about it, to people who you don't want to give it?  =:-I                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217059/#Comment_217059" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T15:12:39+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  3:12PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay then, nevermind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9761/why-doesnt-fanmail-suck" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9761/why-doesnt-fanmail-suck" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9761/why-doesnt-fanmail-suck/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9761%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9761%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
