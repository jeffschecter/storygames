But he doesn't see the point in giving Gygax the credit being lauded him in various remembrances, obituaries and eulogies.  Eulogies being delivered, by the way, by such media darlings as Stephen Colbert, no less.<br/><br/>There are more fiery paragraphs, but I'll quote the end:\n<blockquote>We laughed. But, you know? He\u2019s right. Clinging to Gary so you, the self-conscious gamer, can avoid feeling alone and awkward in your nerd shame is giving Gary a lot more credit than he deserves. You and your friends earned that by what you did. Gary didn\u2019t even order the pizza for Christ\u2019s sake.<br/><br/>He made a fun game. He had a life and a family and did lots of stuff. He died. He was just a guy from Wisconsin. Ok? Ok.<br/><br/>I\u2019m not half as sad that Gary died as I am sad that the hobby still defines itself as a lifestyle rather than as an activity.</blockquote>\nAs the author of Nine Worlds and Dust Devils, among others, you'd think that Snyder would, at least, be able to acknowledge the debt that he has to Gygax and the rest who came after him for the creation of the hobby that he has, at least marginally, profited from.  Gygax is, at least in the realm of the RPG, one of the giants on whose shoulders we all stand, to borrow a phrase.  I'm assuming that there's a tacit acknowledgement there, but if there isn't, then Matt needs a serious reality check.  Yes, we'd all be "doing something else" - but we're not, and Snyder isn't.<br/><br/>The broader question that I'd like to explore is the entanglement of RPGs as 'activity' and RPGs (and gaming) as 'lifestyle'.  Snyder finds it sad that people identify this closely with gaming and RPGs.  I can only imagine that I'm one of the people that makes him sad, since my second-to-last blog post states very clearly that I believe that D&amp;D, and the creative outlet of RPGs in general, saved me from doing something stupid with my life when I was 13 - either ending it, or wasting it on drugs or some other, far darker, 'lifestyle'.<br/><br/>Why this is a surprise to Snyder is a mystery to me.  Games, and RPGs in particular, are a quintessentially social medium.  You can't (I'll qualify this as 'couldn't', actually, since I'm sure it's possible now with CRPGs and MMOs) play an RPG without being immersed in a miasma of social interaction with your fellow players.  Even if it isn't the explicit, tree-hugging 'the system is within us and without us' notion of the indie scene, RPGs require the formation, manipulation and exposition of social discourse among the players.  In other words, even if you're an asocial bastard, you still have to meet your fellow players in a space somewhere outside yourself in order to facilitate play.  If you don't, you're not going to be playing for long.<br/><br/>Mix this together with the identity play that is the core of the RPG experience, the 'I am Giigor Redweave, Rug Merchant to the Sultan of Zum' transference that takes place during the course of play, and you have a heady concoction ripe for transference of all kinds.  Including the incorporation of the idea of 'gamer' into the idea of oneself.  Apparently, Matt's never made that kind of transference, and that's all well and good.  But for a great many people, perhaps socially or physically isolated from people who shared their interests at a critical juncture in the formation of their personal identity, made that connection with a something, with a percieved 'someone', even if that someone was a fantasy character of their own device.<br/><br/>Now, I will be the first to say that I think that game (and RPG) culture has its flaws.  They are legion.  But I don't see Mr. Snyder's refutation of the impact of Gary Gygax's work on the lives of those of us who played, still play, and have embraced the game as part of their identity as separate from this culture.  Instead, it rings to me as exactly the sort of myopic, unempathetic, asocial caricature that Matt Snyder wants to divorce himself from.<br/><br/>Instead of dismissing it, I think that we can take a look at the grief being expressed in the gaming community and try to take from it some lessons on the power of playing with identity and community - a power that I think gets taken for granted in game design.<br/><br/>[cross-posted to <a href="http://blog.kumapageworks.org/elsewhere/]" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://blog.kumapageworks.org/elsewhere/]</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133061/#Comment_133061" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T17:50:43+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  5:50PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 5:52PM by Lord_Minx.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, I can see where you're coming from, but I can also only imagine that this will end in flames.

I don't know where to start with things like this: \n<blockquote>Apparently, Matt's never made that kind of transference, and that's all well and good. </blockquote>\nAsk me. I'm pretty certain you're wrong about this one, though.<br/><br/>As for dismissal, who's doing that? Have you identified my point? Based on this reaction, I'm not seeing you actually get what I'm saying. Instead, I see you setting me up as the villain in a play I never wrote.<br/><br/>To recapitulate: I think people are not giving themselves enough credit for meeting their wives via RPGs, or avoiding drugs, or whatever thing. Laying the credit for those social things at Gary's feet is nonsense in my view. That's my point. It's a point that says "Geez, I wish people getting awfully nostalgic for Gary would realize they are better, stronger, more social people than they first think themselves to be." It's me saying the hobby doesn't give itself enough credit as confident, happy people. <br/><br/>Which I'd describe eagerly as "taking a look at grief being expressed ... and trying to take from it some lessons on the power of playing with identity and community." That I don't have precisely <i>your</i> reaction to recent events makes me very pleased; it means I'm able to offer something to readers on my blog something to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133066/#Comment_133066" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T18:25:39+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  6:25PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, though I would argue with some of your thoughts, I also see validity in them.

Sure, it may be a blog frequented by a lot of people from this community, but a person's blog is their own forum to say whatever they wish. If we don't like what's said, we don't read it. When some of my friends were getting stupid (in my own biased opinion) following the last election, I temporarily took them off my friends list. When the firestorm was over, I added them back, with no hard feelings on my part. <br/><br/>Now, I'm middle of the road on the Gygax thing. I definitely feel it's the ending of an era, and I realize that if he'd not done what he did so many years ago, I would be a vastly different person. But I find it hard to feel anything approaching grief about Gygax' death. I read the threads here, and I find I'm more moved by other people's feelings about it than the actual event itself. <br/><br/>Was what Matt said insensitive? Maybe so. Was it without merit? Maybe not. If you're sensitive about the topic right now, this is a good warning sign to avoid reading this blog entry until you're a bit better recovered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133081/#Comment_133081" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T19:46:42+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  7:46PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 8:08PM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, <br/><br/>As someone who said something like "I wouldn't have met Mo if it wasn't for Gary, which is ironic as she was a girl and shouldn't have been playing RPGs anyway" I'd have to say that if mine was one of the kind of comments you were thinking of, then you were misreading me. <br/><br/>I know I was the one who got Mo to love me. I know that RPGing had little enough to do with that love. But we met in an online RPG, which probably wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for D&amp;D. <br/><br/>I probably would have met another wonderful woman, and had a wonderful marriage, because I'm a wonderful person. But without D&amp;D, and thus without White Wolf, and thus without The Dreaming MUSH, Mo and I would really never have met. (Also I'd like to thank Bill Gates, Al Gore, and my toe for hurting so much that day that I stayed home and played on a MUSH rather than going dancing.) <br/><br/>So it isn't that Gary won my wife for me, its more that there is this odd moment of realizing how connected we can all be to people that you wouldn't think we were connected to. It has little to do with me owing anyone anything, and more to do with me musing on connections in a digital age. <br/><br/>I think many, many others are having similar levels of reactions, and its just the net that makes them sound like something else. <br/><br/>Everyone that is not Matt, <br/><br/>I have also seen a lot of reactions that I don't get. Like, people who didn't give a shit about Gary or D&amp;D three days ago who now are talking about traveling cross country to the funeral, or talking about how much they love the red box (when the Red Box was written largely put together by Tom Moldvay who died a year ago with little fan fare or remembrance) and because of it had their soul saved from damnation in a way that I would kinda back away from if it was Jesus they were talking about, much less D&amp;D. <br/><br/>Gary was a guy, he did some really cool stuff and some not so cool stuff. He died, and that is sad. His life did touch my life, and I think it was fitting to pause and acknowledge that. But the sudden rash of hero-making and extreme stances is, well, a bit odd to me. I haven't said a lot about it, because.. well... I don't care that much. But if I had given voice to some of my wonderment it might have sounded a lot like some of what Matt said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133084/#Comment_133084" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T20:21:02+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  8:21PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey everyone ease up on Matt.

I'm a little taken aback by the current garment-rending in nerd-dom myself. If you had asked me on Monday hypothetically how I'd react to Gygax's death, I'd have shrugged and probably cracked a few obvious jokes.<br/><br/>It turns out I'm more effected by the actuality than I would of thought, I suspect because mortality is starker when its real and irrevocable; small and distant to my daily concerns as he was, Gygax is an element of my life that is now gone, forever, despite that smallness. Now amplify that by the strength of the reactions around me. My composure goes to hell when everyone starts wailing.<br/><br/>Point being, this is not a subject that will respond well to reasonable discourse of any kind until the psychic reverberations have settled a bit, and that's the only thing I take Matt to task for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133098/#Comment_133098" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T21:26:08+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  9:26PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 9:26PM by Kuma.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ack - supposed to be a whisper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133103/#Comment_133103" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T21:51:07+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  9:51PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 9:54PM by Kuma.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Brian, you're misreading me in all kinds of ways, and you're being pretty insulting, really.

I think I won't do that from now on.<br/><br/>I'd like to hear how identification with a character or a game carried over into your everyday life.\n<blockquote>To recapitulate: I think people are not giving themselves enough credit for meeting their wives via RPGs, or avoiding drugs, or whatever thing. Laying the credit for those social things at Gary's feet is nonsense in my view. That's my point. It's a point that says "Geez, I wish people getting awfully nostalgic for Gary would realize they are better, stronger, more social people than they first think themselves to be." It's me saying the hobby doesn't give itself enough credit as confident, happy people.</blockquote>\nThere's a difference between giving credit and abdicating credit, if you will.  I'm perfectly aware that my miserable 13-year-old self dragged himself from out of the muck and stuck it out until things got better.  Acknowledging the role that RPGs had in that process (irony!) doesn't mean that I'm discrediting my own strengths.  Gary's death is simply a reminder that without the tools that he fashioned, my life would look very different than it does now.  Maybe better, maybe worse - but since I like who and where I am now, and I feel that he has contributed to that in some measure, then it's right to feel a loss when he's passed, despite the fact that I never met him personally.  <br/><br/>It's not a zero-sum game.\n<blockquote>Which I'd describe eagerly as "taking a look at grief being expressed ... and trying to take from it some lessons on the power of playing with identity and community." That I don't have precisely<i>your</i>reaction to recent events makes me very pleased; it means I'm able to offer something to readers on my blog something to think about.</blockquote>\nIt makes me pleased too - I wouldn't wish my middle-school years on my worst enemy.  :^)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133122/#Comment_133122" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T23:34:19+00:00" title="March  6, 2008 11:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played RPGs <b>and</b> got into drugs.

I also think Matt is being a little unsympathetic towards gamers that feel emotionally affected by Gygax's passing. Combined, these qualities lead to a conflict where it seems kind of silly to have one.<br/><br/>I'm one of these people that isn't particularly affected by Gary's death. I never enjoyed D&amp;D, and never met Gary in person. \n<blockquote>...you'd think that Snyder would, at least, be able to acknowledge the debt that he has to Gygax and the rest who came after him for the creation of the hobby that he has, at least marginally, profited from. Gygax is, at least in the realm of the RPG, one of the giants on whose shoulders we all stand, to borrow a phrase. I'm assuming that there's a tacit acknowledgement there, but if there isn't, then Matt needs a serious reality check. Yes, we'd all be "doing something else" - but we're not, and Snyder isn't.</blockquote>\n...so I find some of this a bit odd.<br/><br/>Sure, Gary Gygax started the whole ball of wax. Gaming wouldn't be what it is without his early work. That's great, but why should his passing affect me personally if I wasn't emotionally touched by his work and didn't know him as a person? Bill Gates probably won't be upset when the founders of ARPANET pass away, so why is it taken for granted that we'll be upset in this instance?<br/><br/>I obviously don't mean to do down the family's loss in this situation. It's a damn shame from that point of view, but not uncommon that someone dies too soon. It happens every day.<br/><br/>Then, perhaps I'm just not emotionally involved with people outside of my friends and family. When my favourite author - who I had met and who I imagine had a similar effect on me that Gygax had on Kuma as a teenager - died last year, I felt slightly sad, but it wasn't something that ever required a forum post. My favourite author was a cool guy, an amazing writer, but he's dead and that's just how it is. I didn't get particularly upset by that fact. (Then again, he died after quite a long illness, so maybe I just had time to get used to the fact of his death.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133138/#Comment_133138" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T02:41:47+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  2:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pooka</cite><br/>Sure, Gary Gygax started the whole ball of wax.

I'm saying that there are people who <i>have</i> been emotionally touched by his work, and have a different idea of his importance in their life because of it.<br/><br/>An interesting contrast/compare: Brett Favre just retired from the Green Bay Packers.  You'd think by the media coverage here in Wisconsin, from the 200-point banner headlines and the hastily-erected billboards that he had died in the red zone giving the Packers one last Superbowl victory, instead of just, you know, retiring after 17 years of getting knocked over by burly men.  <br/><br/>People get emotionally attached to people who they see as symbolizing an important facet of their life.

Let's agree that sharing this is not even in the absurd universe of Matt proving that he's not an asshole we can bring back into the fold for his sins, and instead in the realm of Matt sharing some cool, entertaining stuff.<br><br/>So, I haven't done much other than run games as a game master in recent years. I've played a time or two, but it's mostly running games. But, a couple years ago I played a character in a Riddle of Steel game. He was this dispossessed nobleman who became absolutely ruthless, but still quite charming, to regain his family estate, name and honor. He was loosely based on a kind of Roman nobleman/cavalryman who goes to a northern city where he set at becoming rich, building an army, helping his new pals a bit, and returning to capture his noble rights from a family rival.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not real enthused about the word transference. But, playing this character with my friends was, of course, great fun. And, it lead to us later in many instances talking about how people too often soft-pedal for what they want, and that while we first thought of my character as pretty villainous and terrible, in fact we understood the character better, and ourselves better. That is, that it isn't ok to stick people with swords like my character did. But, it totally is ok to not feel bad for going after something, and giving up a lot of worry of "what people think of you" along the way. <br/><br/>Which, you know, is pretty funny. That kind of thinking is a large reason why I am able to write controversial things. I've given up many fears I used to have about what people think about me, fears that kept me from acting and instead worrying. None of this means I "get" to stop being a decent person to other humans. But, it does mean that anxiety about someone, out there in the nebulous world being hurt or offended by my thoughts is actually hurtful only to me. It prevents me from thinking and expressing who I am.<br/><br/>So, playing my character had a small part of that personal growth. Neat. I personally view that as comparable to, say, being moved by a novel significantly enough to change one's behavior and improve oneself. Also, neat.<br/><br/>I don't agree that this transference thing you're talking about makes me a "gamer" or whatever. I say that because much of what I recognize as being a "gamer" is about is about so many things outside the imagination of actual play. It's things like "Well, you're <i>supposed</i> to just love Order of the Stick and use the word Ale a lot and NOT think Dr. Who is just boring and laugh about 'freaking the mundanes' and so on." I just don't care much about those kinds of things.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133184/#Comment_133184" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T08:05:35+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  8:05AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2008 8:18AM by Matt Snyder.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Buzz, my post will remain.

You might want to tack this in the comments.</blockquote>\nAgreed. <br/><br/>Well, ok, it was there, obliquely, but it was hard to suss out on first read. I didn't catch the whole point Matt reiterated above, which of course indicates that the blog post didn't do its job as intended. That's worth considering.<br/><br/>As for me, I don't think so much about the things that Gygax did for me (actually, it was more Arneson, if I'm getting my history right: The one who really turned the RPG hobby on. Gygax seemed more like "the cranky one who got a lot of attention for the hobby"). But I sure as heck wax nostalgic at times about those ties of fate, the way things happen:<br/><br/>If I didn't go to College X, I never would have met Y, majored in Z and A, gone to Japan, met my wife, yadda yadda.<br/><br/>If I didn't sleep with X, I'd be married to Y, and living in Z with three kids and doing A. But instead, I have the life I have now.<br/><br/>That sort of thing. But in this case, for me, it would be something like: If it weren't for Gygax (his own efforts, or the fact that he was the mouthpiece of the hobby), I wouldn't have met my best friend X, played all that TORG which got me involved in Y, which led down this long fateful trail which includes Buddhism, Friends, Playing these tabletop games and not plugged into MMOs 24/7, or something.<br/><br/>But that's just me, I'm waxing nostalgic, putting that Fate Trail together where Gygax started the ball rolling.<br/><br/>I think the "Met my wife" comments are the same. <br/><br/>Unsure about the "and that's how I kicked drugs" part (as seen on RPGNet, etc); on the latter I agree with Matt: "<i>No, man, that was ALL YOU. RPGs might have been a tool you implemented, but if it weren't for your own efforts you'd just be into hard drugs AND RPGS: So give yourself more credit, man</i>". <br/><br/>On the former, I find it a wistful contemplation of The Paths I Took, How I Got To Where I Am, and How Things Might Have Been Different. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite>Point being, this is not a subject that will respond well to reasonable discourse of any kind until the psychic reverberations have settled a bit, and that's the only thing I take Matt to task for.</blockquote>\nAgreed!<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, Buzz, re this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>BIll gates is a lousy example to use, because he's an asshole who's wasted more of the world's money and man-hours than just about anyone else. Of course you won't be sad when he dies.</blockquote>\nI'll be sad when he dies, and I don't mean "a man dies" sad, I mean *sad*. I've used computers long enough to know that, if not for Bill's motivation of "a PC on every desktop" and "dumbing it down so that anyone can use it" (and pulling the goals he reached out of context from the sometimes underhanded methods and dirty tricks MS used to achieve those goals)... well, we'd live in a world that would be ruled by PCs owned by geeks only (or Mac enthusiasts), where my grandma would be required to troubleshoot, if not <i>compile</i>, her NIC driver in order to send me an email. At home I use Windows. At work I use straight Unix and Linux. And I've got a lot of respect for the guy for setting down the infrastructure for people/professional-usable PCs in an environment not ruled by bitter computer sysops.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133208/#Comment_133208" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T08:41:38+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  8:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Hey everyone ease up on Matt.

I recently lashed out at a friend over this, before I realized that his sensitivity to his friends' mortality was such that the death of a stranger, even a relatively important one to him, seemed out of place. I can respect that, even though honestly Gary Gygax's death moved me far more than a death in my family, and I have rational reasons for that.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I'm mourning through a strained attempt to heighten my productivity and reconnect with my (admittedly creepy to me) local gaming community. And Tom Moldvoy's passing should have been more of a milestone as a man with cherished accomplishments, but Gary Gygax was a spiritual leader in my eyes. If you'd have asked me a week ago how I'd feel about his passing, I might have gone to see him and tell him myself, and I've rededicated myself to making sure, for whatever reasons which are mine and mine alone, that my ailing heroes know the debt which I owe them. That, I believe, is my decision, and one I make gladly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133209/#Comment_133209" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T08:41:53+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  8:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2008 8:43AM by Tristan.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe the key in here is the difference between "emotionally distressed" and "symbolically affected".<br/><br/>See, I can understand the fact that just because someone I never personally knew died doesn't mean I have to be grieving as if my grandpa had died... That is fanaticism. (Note that it has nothing to do with geekdom. A lot of "non-geeks" do this all the time. Just like in the Brett Favre example.)<br/><br/>A different thing is the acknowledge that someone had a lasting influence in my life. At least in my personal case, role playing suited my nature and tastes, and <b>that</b> is why it became a part of my lifestyle. Not the other way around. Gary started it all. I symbolically feel we owe him a lot for that.<br/><br/>Now, of course the response for his death is a lot more emotional than that of Bill Gates will be. But, as it was previously pointed out, he is an asshole. And Gary was not. He was always friendly, and his interest was in making people happy and enjoy a good time, just like he did. Not getting rich[er].<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>To recapitulate: I think people are not giving themselves enough credit for meeting their wives via RPGs, or avoiding drugs, or whatever thing.

It's me saying the hobby doesn't give itself enough credit as confident, happy people.</blockquote>\nI'm sorry I'm taking this back again. And please, do not read this as an attack. It is not.
