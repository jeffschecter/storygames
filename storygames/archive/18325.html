It\u2019s something I\u2019ve played a few times and wanted to get straight in my head before organising and think I\u2019ve managed it. Three of the four players made characters last session, we have a complicated background convert from back east, a homespun \u2018everything is good\u2019 sheltered type, and a zealous daughter of one of the leaders of the Faith so far. Intro scenes went well and I\u2019m happy that they have the system in their heads and are buying in to the game, which is a relief as I\u2019m foisting it on the players a bit.<br/><br/>While I was getting ready I made a town, then I remembered that I\u2019d already mentally sorted a town so I made that one too. Both are below and I\u2019d like comments from other people that have run the game. My aims for the towns are to make them interesting, reasonably conflicted but to avoid sexual and gender power themes in the first instance. I\u2019m still being careful about implanting too much of a \u2018the game has to be about this\u2019 vibe on my players as I\u2019m a bit worried I could startle them away from it if things come in too hard on that front.<br/><br/>East Bear Creek (everyone has names, but I\u2019ve not noted them down for this one)<br/><br/>Pride \u2013 Based around money, a wagon train heading West has been stranded in the town by a run of bad luck. Their supplies are running low and they have little money to buy more. They are Outsiders to the Faith and winter is coming.<br/><br/>Injustice \u2013 The Steward has decided that because the Outsiders are not of the Faith he cannot risk the well being of the branch by letting them have supplies, they have to fend for themselves and it isn\u2019t going well.<br/><br/>Sin - Deceit \u2013 One of the family of farmers among the Faithful has decided that the Outsiders must be provided for and has been stealing from the stores to feed them.<br/><br/>Demonic Attacks \u2013 The Demons have brought vermin and disease to the store rooms to make the scarcity even more acute.<br/><br/>False Doctrine \u2013 The Steward believes that only the Faithful deserve to live and the Outsiders must look to their false gods and starve because of their choice of faith.<br/><br/>Corrupt Worship \u2013 The Steward is preaching his views to the congregation as the Word of the King of Life.<br/><br/>False Priesthood \u2013 The Steward is backed by the elders of the branch who look after the stores.<br/><br/>What people want \u2013 The Steward wants to the Dogs to run the Outsiders out of town. The farmers who are stealing supplies want the Dogs to order the Steward to look after the Outsiders. The elders want to have the Outsiders pay for the spoiled stores and to have the thieves caught and punished respectively.<br/><br/>What the Demons want \u2013 The Faithful to murder the Outsiders and then turn on each other.<br/><br/>What the Demons want the Dogs to do \u2013 Back the Steward, reveal the Thief and leave.<br/><br/>If the Dogs don\u2019t come \u2013 The Thief will be caught and hanged, the Faithful will split and fall upon each other, during the rioting the Outsiders will be butchered.<br/><br/><br/>Tall Pine Station (This was my original idea for a first town, but written up second and in some haste, I think this needs more work, it doesn't feel like it has enough challenge to it.)<br/><br/>The situation is that the Steward, Br. Tobias, has died of natural causes just before the Dogs arrive in town. With no-one to officiate the Faithful have not buried him.<br/>Sr. Adeliza believes that her husband, Br. Luke, should be the next Steward. Sr. Bethany believes that her husband, the Steward, was murdered and is bringing disunity to the branch by spreading rumours that Sr. Adeliza has been scheming and using Br. Zadok for her bidding. She hasn\u2019t quite accused Br. Zadok of killing her husband yet. The Demons have been striking those that Sr. Bethany dislikes down with diseases that are leaving them bedridden. Br. Jesse has put himself forward to act as Steward. Sr Content is among the townsfolk accusing Sr. Adeliza of being prideful with respect to her husbands possible future position.<br/><br/>What they want \u2013 Sr. Adeliza wants the Dogs to declare her husband, Br. Luke, Steward. Br. Luke wants Br. Tobias to be given a good funeral. Sr. Bethany wants her husbands murderer brought to justice (remembering that he wasn\u2019t actually murdered). The Demons want Br. Luke to be the Steward as he will be weak, they are making Sr. Bethany look like a witch.<br/><br/>If the Dogs don\u2019t come then Br. Luke will become the Steward and the branch will fall in to decline, ripe for further Demon incursions.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413170/#Comment_413170" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T04:57:04+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  4:57AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go all the way to hate and murder.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is crime fiction.

What I found with the town creation process is that I tended to get richer towns when I didn't have the same person escalate through the steps, but had people who were affected by the previous step react to it by taking the next one. So maybe, for example, instead of the Steward having false doctrine you might have a messier conflict if someone <i>else</i> developed some false doctrine, e.g. something to justify stealing or maybe saying they don't have to respect a cruel Steward. "Single villain" towns work, but I found I had a more fun experience when I spread the steps around among different people. <br/><br/>I'm not sure I buy the "go to Hate and Murder, it's the best!" advice (some of my best towns didn't), but I don't really see much conflict in Tall Pines Station, and the "mystery" element about the old Steward's death could be problematic in play because you might find yourself unsure about what to reveal vs. what to hide and how to reliably get the true facts to the players. In the first town I GMed I had some information cooked into the setup that none of the NPCs could realistically communicate to the players so I had a very hard time doing the "actively reveal" thing, and play suffered. Generally I try to steer away from conflicts that are information-based, e.g. misunderstandings or mistakes, because they're so easy to defuse. I find that genuinely incompatible beliefs, goals, or desires tend to be better building-blocks for Dogs towns.<br/><br/>(Also, if and when you go all the way to the Murder step, try not to murder one of the people causing tension, have somebody <i>else</i> get murdered so the reaction to it adds to the tension built up in the previous steps -- before I figured this out I couldn't understand why going to Hate and Murder would increase tension because it actually <i>decreases</i> if the murder eliminates someone who was causing conflict with other people in the town).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413187/#Comment_413187" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T08:09:07+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  8:09AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, moving some of the focus off of the Steward in East Bear Creek should be easy enough, I think part of the problem I'm having is the idea that the problem and the Demons probably don't need to be as solidly linked as I think they do. The demonic influence in the town feels like the kicker to get a good handful of dice on the GM's side so that conflicts become sufficiently balanced that the players need to consider their options. I'm comfortable with the idea that when it comes to the dice the PC's are at an advantage, but making it a manageable one rather than consistently a walk over is one of the hurdles I've had prior to feeling happy to run the game. How that factors with spreading the sins around I'm not so sure about.<br/><br/>My GMing style means I have no problem with, and the other players have come to expect, the concept of just announcing some facts as real without needing big investigation to find them, so with Tall Pines Station I'd have no problem with the statement, 'you go in and see the body of the Steward, looks like he died of over eating' (I guess I should actually decide what he died from) and after any real questions at all state 'nope, this is natural causes, no murder here'. Just because they know it, doesn't mean that convincing his widow of the fact is then a given...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
