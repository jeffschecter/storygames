I am relatively new here.<br/><br/>I recently ordered the Apocalypse World book (on January 23rd to be exact) and I have not heard anything about shipping at all. It has been three weeks. Should I be concerned? <br/><br/>What are the usual experiences with ordering AW?  <br/><br/>Thank you for your time,<br/>Mike <br/><br/>Edit: It seems they were waiting on a print run and it should ship soon. Thanks!<br/><br/>TLDR: Nothing to see here folks, just some guy talking to himself.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
