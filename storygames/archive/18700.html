I'm designing a game around sitcoms, and I came to an impasse. What games are generally funny at a systemic level? Since I normally game with other comics or people who share my humor, I don't have a clear picture of what my playtests are encouraging vs having a solid group is doing.<br/><br/>My game, <i>Very Special Episode</i>, and is designed to evoke 80s-era sitcoms, with a mix of comedy and social-issues. It's semi-DM'd, with a rotating director who establishes a scene and orders the other player-actors around, and a producer who keeps track of running jokes and plot elements. Players give each other laugh tokens when another player makes them laugh, and development tokens when someone brings the plot forward and/or interacts with the episode's Very Special Issue.<br/><br/>But my question is, <b>how can a game best be funny while remaining group neutral</b>? How do you foster creativity in roleplaying? <br/><br/>The funniest game I know is probably <i>Paranoia</i>. It combines lack of player information with lack of skill and lack of severe punishment. You may flub fixing a collapsing ceiling and get buried, but that'll set you back one life (and you get six).  Plus, perversity points allow players to be directly rewarded for making the GM laugh. Note passing leads to bizarre plans that are foiled before other people know about them.<br/><br/><i>Fiasco</i>, as a neutral, GM-less story, can lead to comedy, mostly comedy of recognition. The characters put each other in bad situations and natural empathy makes you think, oh snap, how did things get so terrible?<br/><br/><i>Everyone is John</i> combines pathos and randomness, as player's secret agendas and lack of direct control lead to disastrous consequences for John. <br/><br/>What systems do you know that encourage humor, and how do they do it?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419848/#Comment_419848" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T13:54:24+00:00" title="August  9, 2013  1:54PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep it Sunny does it extremely well. It emulates a TV series which it seems nobody has ever seen except me and the guy who wrote the game, but it works anyway. I'd explain how it works, but really, the game is free and the rules are super light, so you might as well just google it and read it. It takes five minutes to read through.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm dead against fanmail mechanics and I'd be very wary of a game where you get points for making others laugh. People are going to want to make each other laugh anyway. It's an inherently rewarding behavior and everyone likes doing it, especially in a sitcom game. Is handing people points when it happens going to make that happen even more? I'd wager it will do the opposite. Either that one dude who's really funny gets lots of points and that one quiet guy gets none and it's really obvious and it gets awkward. Or people give points to the quiet guy for just trying and it's obvious and awkward. And people will think "Why didn't I get a point for that joke? That was funny!" And they'll start trying to say things others think are funny instead of things they themselves think are funny, which is a terrible idea. And of course economical reward (points) of an inherently rewarding behavior (being funny) will decrease the inherent reward. That's a commonly observed effect in psychology.<br/><br/>Like Rickard told me at N\xe4rCon: "A guy gave me a point for being awesome. I felt insulted. I know I was awesome and I'm not doing it to get points." It's like having sex and then seeing your partner open up the wallet. "That was great! Here's some money!"<br/><br/>But that's my perspective, and though fanmail is disliked by many here in Sweden, it seems popular in the US, so I dunno.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ultraberg" title="Ultraberg"><img alt="Ultraberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ultraberg">Ultraberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419849/#Comment_419849" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T13:58:20+00:00" title="August  9, 2013  1:58PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2013 2:37PM by Ultraberg.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran into that problem in an early playtest; you could accumulate a lot of points, but they didn't do much. Then I changed them; gaining the most points at the end of an episode (roughly 30 minutes of play) lets you do a post 3rd act "Tag", where you have a funny little scene with whoever you choose. Then you choose the next funny B plot.<br/><br/>Of course, that still wasn't an economy. Now you can give 3 laughs tokens to make another player have a pratfall or funny business, or 3 development to get a teary eyed monologue about drugs, office bullying or the income gap. <br/><br/>Edit: I liked Keep It Sunny!

Although they have enhanced abilities, they are actually over-confident klutzes. The comedy comes from them attempting basic tasks such as going to the hypermarket to buy booze and snacks and, despite their powers, failing in a variety of bizarre ways. Mechanically this is achieved by the 'yes (but)' dice engine, which allows them to succeed in their actions but have unexpected consequences of those actions narrated by the GM according to the number of demerits they roll (1s and 2s on a pool of d6s that is inversely proportional to their stat).<br/><br/>Check out some of my AP reports </a><a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/18392/sci-fi-beta-kappa" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <br/><br/>Ok, shill over, my more general point would be that comedy usually resides not in the game or system itself but in the player group (including the ref); comedy can happen in almost any game if the players see the comic potential of a sentence or phrase, or some action is done in a inherently comic way. A GM at my club, along with his regular player group (which usually includes me) is well known for this, and one regularly hears guffaws of laughter emanating from his table, whether he's running WoD, HEX, All For One or whatever. I'm sure you could find comic potential in AW, although I think in general indie games with a high emotional content lend themselves less to comedy than more trad games. But yeah, I reckon AW could have its comedy moments also.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419852/#Comment_419852" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T15:48:46+00:00" title="August  9, 2013  3:48PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Comedy needs a straight man.<br/><br/>Inspectres is the best comedy game I've played purely for telling you to make boring characters.

Most people find it easier to be funny when they're feeling relaxed. A point system is going to create a competitive situation that might stifle humor.

However, it seems that <b>TDoV</b> breaks the mold. After having the introduction and learning what is funny, players find those things genuinely funny when they are encountered in game.  The laughs at the table are genuine, and some people laugh until tears start flowing.<br/><br/>However, I think there is an element of western cultural background here. I wonder if the experiences would be different for a group of players who had not had the Brittish historical cultural influence as part of their own culture. The players who seem to enjoy the game the most have some concept of the Shakespearean legacy, but even those with no such knowledge enjoy themselves.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419910/#Comment_419910" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T07:43:05+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  7:43AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if this phenomenon relates to the laugh track? Hated as it is, the reason the laugh track is so commonly employed is simply because we think jokes are funnier if we hear people laughing at them. The laugh track works. Humor is partly social and seeing (or hearing) others laugh at a joke makes us more inclined to laugh along, and because we laugh, we really do find the joke funny. Watching a funny movie with a pencil between your teeth, making you grin, will make you find it funnier than watching it with a pencil between your lips (making you pout).<br/><br/>In the same way, starting out by saying "This, this and this is funny, so there", this makes it obvious that when someone introduces this in the game, they're doing something that's supposed to be funny. And if it's supposed to be funny, and it's in a social group in a relaxed situation, this will make you want to laugh. And if you laugh, you'll find it funny.<br/><br/>That's my amateur psych 101 interpre-guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419915/#Comment_419915" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T08:35:10+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  8:35AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that seems like a likely explanation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419935/#Comment_419935" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T11:52:12+00:00" title="August 12, 2013 11:52AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Toon is another funny game. <br/><br/>I think funny games need to be grounded in their own reality.

This comes from the fact that the player/character gets something when they make other players laugh.<br/>InSpectres is great at generating zany play, because the story changes every time a different player gets a 6 on skill rolls.<br/><br/>Other games come close, when the rules and roles evoke the kind of silliness that the game is going for. Macho Women with Guns named all the skills/advantages/disadvantages in a funny way. It was not melee, it was hit things with other things or run in high heels. And it is hard to get too serious about a game that had top heavy as a disadvantage that did not let you shoot at anything at a lower altitude than your character. Of course other games do that, Paranoia for instance. these help, but they do not seal the deal if the game play is not about making your friends laugh in my opinion.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson" title="AllanDotson"><img alt="AllanDotson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/587/nCEFJQOAECTHQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">AllanDotson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419947/#Comment_419947" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T16:20:08+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  4:20PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://seadracula.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Sea Dracula</a> uses actual player dance-offs for scene resolution.

My game was among many that suffered from too much structure.  Games with solid comedic stuff to do but fewer rules about how and when to do it were better received.<br/><br/>Paul, nope, Rat Race has never hit the table.
