I made four pregens and wrote up some scenario notes. Watched some vampire movies. I used the same pregens and notes for both sessions. The sessions were very different, but both ended in bloodshed. <br/><br/>Just in case there's some confusion about the matter, GUMSHOE does not require a pre-determined clue trail. In NBA this is explicit, and I built the whole scenario on that principle. The PCs had a mission - their employer got hit a couple of days ago, make sure it doesn't happen again, here's the prime suspect - and they went about it their own way. They suggested cool, spy fiction-y ways to gather information, and I gave them what they wanted. Because their characters are competent and badass. I said yes a whole lot. But it's a horror game, so I said "no" and "maybe" a lot, too, but I tried to be informative or suggestive about it. "No, you can't get any info, because the NPC shuts up and gets scared when you mention the name."<br/><br/>The first group tried gathering a lot of intel by social engineering, but managed to piss off people (and gather clues). The second group tried electronic surveillance by planting bugs, but the opposition found out and retaliated.<br/><br/>NBA has two wonderful mechanical tools that suit spy fiction. The skill "Cover" lets you make up cover identities on the fly; "Networks" does the same for contacts, which you can milk for information or supplies. Players loved it and made up names and small backgrounds for the NPCs.<br/><br/>The pregens were my first attempt at making pregens. I usually hate it, so I don't do it. This was fun. You can choose backgrounds for your characters and they give you a coherent skill set. Combine with a spy agency (there are write-ups in the book), pick a Drive (why you do this sort of work) and I basically had all the building blocks I needed. The book includes a GM worksheet so it's easy to keep track of what skills which character has.<br/><br/>The one hickup I had was that it took surprisingly long to explain the rules, maybe 30-40 minutes. There's a wide variety of skills, and the investigative and non-investigative skills work differently. And Networks and Cover have their own stuff to explain. GUMSHOE is a lovely system, but it's not very well known in Finland and the rules explanations take up time from the story.<br/><br/>The game is pretty much everything I want from an RPG. It's driven by fiction, but it's robust mechanically and the rulebook is very explicit about what the purpose of the mechanics is. The mechanics also give birth to more fiction.<br/><br/>If you have any questions concerning the details, I'll gladly answer. The lunchbreak's over, so I can't go into them now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386190/#Comment_386190" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T03:03:43+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  3:03AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that Night's Black Agents generally has so many leads to chase down, that the core clue mechanic becomes less important on the macro level, and the information is laid out in a threat network or pyramid. Information gets you danger, and danger earns you more information. The mission leads players to be very proactive.<br/><br/>Did you get the chance to run any thriller chases?

The agent won, shot the tyres and approached the car. A woman stepped out of the back, and the agent assumed she was a victim of human trafficking. Well, she was a vampire. And he was an agent - past tense.<br/><br/>Vampire-building tools are terrific. Mechanically they're ultra-light and happily don't involve arbitrary point-buy limitations. The only problem - honest - is that there's a couple of metric craptons of delicious options and I can't use them all. Hite's bloody insane in his enthusiasm. I aimed for a gritty game and designed a pretty mundane vampire, Near Dark style, who had predator's instincts, lust for blood, a killer rating in Athletics, superhuman strength. It was also very, very hard to kill, and very, very good at pretending being dead. I loved playing her! Interacting with PCs (and passing herself as human), she was pleasant, ultraconfident and pulled all the strings; as the monster she was fast and deadly and surprising. Never thought I'd get this much fun out of a vampire.<br/><br/>The players didn't use Preparedness, but they loved the idea. All the stuff they needed fit with their areas of expertise.<br/><br/>We didn't use MOS or cherries. The players weren't familiar with the system, so I dropped the extra mechanical payload, Trust mechanics included. Mechanically the mode was a combination of Burn and Dust - gritty cinematic thriller with an emphasis on the psychological aspects of spy work.<br/><br/>I was shooting for a Bourne-style game, but the players proceeded with more caution. No biggie, since it was fun nonetheless. One of the players in the second game felt that it was really intense even though nothing much happened before the end. But when the excrement hit the ventilation system, the system is insanely fast and allowed me to pace it at a thriller rate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386196/#Comment_386196" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T06:59:56+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  6:59AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, advice for one-offs would be really helpful.

I have a bad habit of writing sentences that are too complicated for my skills.<br/><br/>I've zero experience running a campaign with this, so no help there. But I'll try to sum up what I felt worked and didn't in my one-off. I tried asking for any experience with one-offs beforehand, but no one answered on the Big Purple.<br/><br/>What I felt most anxious about was eventually really easy: the clues and the skills to gather them with. I brainstormed what I wanted the scenario to be about, NPCs and locations and twists and such. Then, I just listed some important facts about the story that PCs could find out. Those were the core clues. Finally I went through the skill list in the book and wrote down ideas. That's it.<br/><br/>None of those were written in stone, but I felt confident enough to run the game. It was enough: when the players asked for stuff, I just gave it to them. If a PC has an Investigative skill, the GM basically just says yes. That's the beauty of the investigative skills: they really fade into the background, and the GM has a sheet on which each PCs investigative skills are listed. The GM says yes if it makes sense considering the PC's skills. In addition, it makes the competent spies seem really badass!<br/><br/>Then I made the four pregens, which I already wrote about in the first message. The Drives were the most important element, and I wrote a few paragraphs on each. I also inserted story hooks ("Your sister is missing, and you suspect human trafficking"), probable contacts ("Your father, who disowned you, knew some people in the Bulgarian mafiya, and you know them too") and possible aliases.<br/><br/>I made the mistake of introducing one of the PCs as the Hacker. Both times, the player interpreted that their job is to stay at the hotel and gather info on the internet. That wasn't my intention, and I'd given the Hacker several other skills to that end. Maybe I should've called her "the security specialist".<br/><br/>None of the pregens knew each other beforehand. At first I'd planned for this to be a hardcore Mirror game - I love PvP at cons - but eventually I took the safer route of centering on PCs vs. opposition. When I abandoned the Mirror route, I also should've abandoned the idea of four strangers. In a four-hour slot, PC introductions etc. take time. (I actually gave the PCs the freedom to betray each other if they wanted to, I just didn't give them the Trust mechanics. And in the first game, one of them really did sell the others to the opposition. That was a surprising and fun turn of events. But still, a team would've worked better.)<br/><br/>I ran the game using the Dust rules - I like my spy stories gritty - but gave them more General skill points so the players would get a better feel for different sides of the game. I took the psychological cost of killing from the Burn rules, but abandoned the Sources of Stability. I love them, but the scenario didn't need them.<br/><br/>The first 30-45 minutes of the games were spent reading the characters and teaching the rules. I explained how skills work, and what the skills are, and that my job wasn't to obstruct them, but make them look badass. It took surprisingly long. Maybe an introductory scenario should start like a tutorial, in which I could teach using the skills in play. <br/><br/>I thought about starting in medias res, but felt that the players need time to get to know their characters and each other before the action starts. An idea for the next time: first give them characters, then give everyone a three-minute introductory scene in some previous situation. "Okay, show us your character in action! Who is she and what is she good at? Where and when does this scene take place?" That way the player could get in character and the other players could get to know her. THEN start in medias res.<br/><br/>I ran the scenario twice, both very player-driven. The first one had a slower pace and I should've handed out the clues more quickly. I think I was afraid the scenario would be over too soon. I had all sorts of stuff in store - the opposition reacting, the cops coming in, and other, nastier twists - but we didn't have time for most of those. We had too much fun with PC-NPC interactions and the characters. Eventually the wetworker made something rash and called down the wrath of the vampire; end result: everyone died but the traitor.<br/><br/>The second session moved at a quicker pace - partly because of me, partly because of the players. The PC whose sister had been trafficked flipped out when he saw the sister at a night club, and things started rolling pretty fast from there. None of them died, but one got slashed and bitten by the vampire.<br/><br/>Both times were pretty scenario-like, as opposed to stories. I gave the PCs characters and a situation, and allowed them to deal with it however they liked. If these were movies, I might've been disappointed at the abrupt, bloody endings; but because these were con scenarios, they worked. I wanted to give the PCs the chance to succeed or fail, and both of the times they failed.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, I'm not sure how fair their battle was. After all, as the GM I'm ultimately responsible for cutting and editing and framing scenes and setting the pace. Partly they failed because they ran out of time, and probably because the players didn't know what was expected of them during the scenario. Their mission was to make sure a gangster wouldn't hit their employer again, and the players probably thought that the hit would be the climax of scenario. I hadn't thought of it that way, but I understand their point of view. <br/><br/>I had planned on introducing a twist after they had made the hit, which I thought would be over pretty soon. But looking back, the players knew this: find out who hit the employer and why, and make sure it doesn't happen again, and let the employer know. It's reasonable to assume, from a player's standpoint, that within the four-hour slot the players would have good time to gather intel before the hit; and that if they made the hit earlier, I'd run out of material.<br/><br/>If you plan on a twist after some event in the story, make sure that the players know that the event isn't the climax of the scenario and that there's stuff afterwards. The twist is that the stuff-that-comes-afterwards isn't what they expected. This way the players can do some of the pacing themselves. <br/><br/>I'll gladly answer further questions on the game. Or edit the text to be more legible, if there's need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386244/#Comment_386244" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T13:15:19+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  1:15PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2012 1:15PM by Graham.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Night's Black Agents is the best iteration of GUMSHOE since Trail of Cthulhu.

In Trail, investigation flows ahead naturally and gets out of the way, and it fits the genre that the protagonists find out stuff, no matter their skill. In NBA, the effortless investigation emphasizes the badassery of the PCs and empowers both the players and the PCs. (GUMSHOE of course always empowers players insofar as they can suggest how their skill could reveal the clue.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386288/#Comment_386288" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-03T05:09:33+00:00" title="August  3, 2012  5:09AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Each GUMSHOE incarnation does have a strong central conceit and all but Trail are very cinematic (which is probably a function of Robin's interests). Whilst I've played tons of Trail, we had some good games of EsoTerrorists and a couple of Fear Itself (the normal punter in an abnormal situation is a great clash).<br/><br/>I've not played much Ashen Stars, but I'm a big fan of Mutant City Blues. Police procedural is a natural fit for GUMSHOE and anyone who has ever watched TV understands the genre immediately. It also fits the TV structure. I ran a game earlier this year with a central plot arc with side investigations and recurring characters. I went for a more supervillain plot rather a heist of the century end and the bad guy (not himself a super) was taken down as he was bringing his plan to fruition, in a more action end sequence than you might expect in CSI (the PCs bugged his safe house using coachroaches with tiny cameras).<br/><br/>The games have become more sophisticated as they are published. The rules aren't really changing very much but it's becoming clearer what kinds of things you can do with them. Benefits, for example, have become much more central over time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
