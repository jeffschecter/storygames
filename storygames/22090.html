For one, I found it too loose for my tastes in how the characters are supposed to interact.  Scarcity and small communities bind the characters together in Apocalypse World.  In SCUP, each PC is part of their own faction potentially spanning a continent, and it (by my read) is on the MC to tie them together and put pressure on their (largely abstracted) resources.  It seems like a game that requires a tight holding environment (pressure binding the PCs together) without providing structure for that.  (The first session advice tells the MC to just ask the characters what they do on a typical day.)  Not having played it, I am eager to hear other folks' experience with this.<br/><br/>The second reason that I've avoided SCUP is that one of the playbooks is a torturer, who has a move that lets them get accurate information from other characters.  It seems to work like the Brainer, except that torture is a real thing (unlike mind control) that doesn't yield good information.  Burning Wheel and Sigmata have rules about how torture work that meshed with my understanding of it (<a href="https://twitter.com/papa_shell/status/1101270631805526016?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Chad Walker shared the Sigmata exerpt here</a>).  To see a rule where a player character uses pain as a currency to exchange for information seemed both facile and offensive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483877/#Comment_483877" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-21T12:02:23+00:00" title="May 21, 2019 12:02PM">May 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are looking for a lighter system than AW, I really enjoy <i>All Men Must Die</i> by Paul Riddle.  It's written as a Game of Thrones hack for Undying, but I have played it in other fantasy-feudal settings with great effect.<br/><br/>It's diceless, with moves using a currency called Fate that can be refilled in scenes where characters reflect on their destinies.  The result of this economy is scenes that alternate between very high stakes and thoughtful reflection.<br/><br/>Also (unlike Fallen Empires or SCUP), all the moves are designed to work the same way against PCs and NPCs.  It is assumed that the player characters are not an adventuring parties but rivals or tenuous allies, and the rules support combat and intrigue between players (so the pressure to bring drama is not solely on the GM).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483878/#Comment_483878" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-21T12:03:55+00:00" title="May 21, 2019 12:03PM">May 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally, Sage LaTorra is working on a Game of Thrones rpg built off Vincent Baker's Apocalypse World: Dark Age.<br/><br/><div class="twitter-card" data-tweetid="1130486093239873536" data-tweeturl="https://twitter.com/olde_fortran/status/1130486093239873536"><a class="tweet-url" href="https://twitter.com/olde_fortran/status/1130486093239873536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/olde_fortran/status/1130486093239873536</a></div><br/><br/>I haven't played it, but I am hoping to try it soon.
