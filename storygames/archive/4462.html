I don't like looking down from the other players or the stuff we're working on or talking about to track or gather dice or fiddle with tokens.  I like cards; I like the feel of them and I like how casual they are.<br/><br/>So I'm trying to think of a GM-free game where the players had a good way of sharing the narrative authority, incentive to compete, and didn't write anything down (<i>edit: while playing through a scene</i>).  This is a combination of a LOT of different ideas I've had following on my reading of and play experiences with Universalis.  There's a lot here but I tried not to bog it down with self-justifying analysis.<br/><br/>So picture this:<br/><br/>4-6 players sitting around a table; they've agreed the basic premise of the story but nobody knows where it's going yet.<br/><br/>One player deals 6 cards to everyone.<br/><br/>Each player chooses 1 card to bid:  Highest bid Sets, Lowest bid Directs.  <br/><br/>Bid cards are not considered discarded: they can be used by the Director but remain in play.<br/><br/>Player who Sets must establish:<br/>1) Location (Where?  Serenity's main hallway)<br/>2) Characters Present (Who?  Captain Mal, Jayne, and Vera)<br/>3) Agenda (Why do we care?  This is a scene where we remember why we should be afraid of Jayne.)<br/>These cost no cards.<br/><br/>Director narrates the opening of the scene.  Director's job is to Put Up conflict whenever a member of the Ensemble Cast goes up against the world or to force the world to Put Up conflict against an Ensemble Cast member.<br/><br/>First Player who suggests a Conflict that has two sides willing to Put Up gets a free face-down card for next round.  The Director is often responsible for Putting Up the opposition.<br/><br/>Putting Up: Whenever there's a conflict that at least two players are interested in (i.e. player vs. player or Director vs. player) each side chooses a number of cards to Put Up.  Red cards beat black cards.  Before the cards are shown, each palyer may add up to 1 card, face-up, drawn from the Deck to up to 1 side, throwing weight behind that side (this is used to show where the weight of facts versus skepticism, but also to indicate what the players think would be awesome).  Winner gains an extra 1 card for next round.<br/><br/>Cards can be spent in a few other ways: <br/>One card to change roles:  This can include taking over being the Director or (the new Director still has to provide opposition if appropriate).  Alternatively this might mean taking the role of something other than a member of the Ensemble cast (i.e. taking the role of a band of space pirates in a scene that your own character is absent in).   <br/>One card to End the Scene if there has been a conflict, three cards to end the scene if there hasn't been a conflict.  <br/>A card, slid forward face-down indicates a Challenge; this forces negotiation or requires the opposing player to spend a Card or withdraw what they were narrating.  If the player withdraws or negotiates to the Challenger's satisfaction the Challenger keeps their card.<br/>One card to Establish a Point - this throws somethign out for the Director and other players to work off of but does not take power away from the Director.  Establishing a Point can go back to basically any fact in the world, subject to a Challenge.<br/><br/>During a conflict, cards can also be spent to Establish a Point by anyone, and while these are subject to Challenge, no more conflicts can be resolved (i.e. no more Putting Up) until after the current conflict resolves.  For example, the conflict might be "Does Aragorn prove he can protect the hobbits?" but someone might Establish the Point that "Frodo is wounded in the fight."  Frodo's player could Challenge that (either to outright stop it or suggesting that this could be a subsequent conflict) but if no one Challenges then the Conflict must be narrated to include the point. <br/><br/>Any cards unspent are tossed at the end of the hand, although some players will have earned extra cards for the next round.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101019/#Comment_101019" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T08:23:39+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  8:23AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot the bangs:<br/><br/>The players can define a bunch of cards to have special uses, for example:<br/><br/>Queen of Hearts: Play for free when calling for a romantic conflict, gain 2 cards for next round.<br/>King of Spades: Play for free when character death is on the line in a conflict, gain 3 cards for next round<br/>Jack of Clubs: Play for free when establishing a point where an object is broken                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101023/#Comment_101023" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T08:31:11+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  8:31AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Putting Up: What happens on a tie (seems very likely occurance)?

It can be a great design tool. But the best way to do this, for me at least, is not to write down the procedures, but a made-up example of how that would actually play out. I write mine as dialogues with brackets for the mechanical cues, like so:<br/><br/>Alberta: Here we go, new round. [Deals 6 cards to each player]<br/>[Players bid and compare cards]<br/>Bert: I've got the highest bid, so I Set. Let's see, this scene takes place in...<br/><br/>And so on. That helps me to really envision how I want actual play to go, where there are points where a bunch of mechanics suddenly stop the flow of play, how people communicate the different pieces to each other, etc.<br/><br/>Do you think you could do this for this design?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101144/#Comment_101144" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T15:33:57+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  3:33PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to keep digging into this a bit.

How about making it a little more democratic, though:<br/><br/>-Low card Sets, defining either Location, Characters Present, or Agenda.<br/>-Second lowest card defines one of the two elements undefined by the Low card player.<br/>-Third lowest card defines the remaining element.<br/><br/>Similarly,<br/><br/>-High card Directs.<br/>-Second highest card gets first pick of which character to play.<br/>-Third highest gets second pick... etc<br/><br/>That's if the players are portraying the characters. I got the impression, from your write-up, that isn't the case, though. If so, does the Director narrate everything happening in that scene? <br/><br/>On the other hand, the part about the Director "Putting Up" against the characters doesn't make sense if they're narrating all the action. So, which is it? \n<blockquote><br/>Putting Up: Whenever there's a conflict that at least two players are interested in (i.e. player vs. player or Director vs. player) each side chooses a number of cards to Put Up.  Red cards beat black cards.  <br/></blockquote>\nCan you explain the red/black thing?

Winner gains an extra 1 card for next round.<br/></blockquote>\nWhy add cards from the deck? Why not from their hands?<br/><br/>Oh, and how do you see new characters entering the scene? Would this be a "Establish" move? Can the Director do it for free?<br/><br/>I designed (but have not yet playtested) a very similar system--players make "arguments" about what the outcome of a given scene should be, and the winner wins tokens as well as narration rights.

The group is called the Whitehall club and I have profiles for them if you care.  The members are Travis, Rob, Bim, Andy, Jan (Janice) and Eva.<br/><br/><b>Setup Phase (Pitch Meeting / Tenets)</b><br/><br/>In the Setup Phase, the group comes up with some Big Ideas and an Ensemble Cast.  Big Ideas are like story element Tenets in Universalis, or the kind of things people agree on in a Primetime Adventures Pitch Meeting.  The Ensemble Cast is created as a group but each player has to settle on a cast member (and want to play it) before the game starts. <br/><br/>Players need a piece of paper for the Big Ideas, another for the Ensemble Cast, and a deck of cards.  For the setup phase, the whole deck is dealt out to all players.<br/><br/>For a Big Idea to become part of the game, it needs someone to Propose it, and two to Support it, and no one Objecting.  If you can get that, the player who Proposes pays 2 cards, the Supporters each pay 1 card, and the Big Idea is agreed (and recorded).<br/><br/>For an Ensemble Cast to be finished, there needs to be a cast member for each player and every player needs to be happy with their cast member.  There will be guidelines for the Ensemble Cast (quality connections, issues) but we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be glossing that over here.<br/><br/><i>(Players arrive)</i><br/>Andy:  Welcome in guys, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got the deck ready.

Ugh.<br/>Travis: What if it had an X-Files element?  So those off-hours lives aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t just dating and such, there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s some kind of conspiracy that casts a pall over it.<br/>Eva: Yes.

You have take on the burden to create text as you go as the trade-off for not being bound by pre-created text.

Serenity's main hallway)<br/>2) Characters Present (Who?  Captain Mal, Jayne, and Vera)<br/>3) Agenda (Why do we care?  This is a scene where we remember why we should be afraid of Jayne.)<br/>These cost no cards.<br/><br/>I really like this part--the way there is value to both high cards and low cards. How about making it a little more democratic, though:</blockquote>I went for High &amp; Low mostly because of how Scene Framing works best IMO.  Somebody gets a cool idea and they're practically jumping up and down to get it rolling.  When that happens in PTA you tend to get really good scenes with fuzzy definition of the "set" - in Universalis you tend to get really good definition of what's there, but notsohot definition of where the scene is going.  I think if one player (subject to Challenge) sets those 3 things at once, that sets a rhythm that I hope gets what I'm looking for.\n<blockquote>That's if the players are portraying the characters. I got the impression, from your write-up, that isn't the case, though. If so, does the Director narrate everything happening in that scene?On the other hand, the part about the Director "Putting Up" against the characters doesn't make sense if they're narrating all the action. So, which is it?</blockquote>Each player has a member of an Ensemble Cast that is "theirs" to portray.  The Director of a scene provides everything else - i.e. acting for other characters and describing events, subject to Challenge or players paying a card to change roles.  You can't take over an Ensemble Cast member if that player is present.\n<blockquote>Can you explain the red/black thing? What's the logic there?  Why add cards from the deck? Why not from their hands?</blockquote>My idea was to have a resolution mechanic that was orthogonal to the scene bid.  Bidding for a scene makes high and low cards valuable, but I don't want to make high or low cards important in the resolution of conflicts.  So I went with PTA's method: Whoever has the most Red cards wins.<br/><br/>As for cards from the Deck - this is like calling on stuff in the world in Universalis, but doesn't depend on having a tightly-recorded set of Components with spent-for Traits.  Players use the cards in their own hand as their "conflict economy" for that scene, but since there's only 2 sides to a Conflict / Putting Up, those extra cards represent the other players saying "I think X is most logical / interesting."  \n<blockquote>Oh, and how do you see new characters entering the scene? Would this be a "Establish" move? Can the Director do it for free?</blockquote>Yes and yes (subject to Challenge).<br/><br/>Thanks for the questions Paul - they're really helping to clarify what I'm doing with this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101459/#Comment_101459" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T19:55:02+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  7:55PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2007 8:10PM by Ry.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so I've been thinking about what I wrote and I think this is the important idea in what the example players are doing above:<br/><br/>Instead of someone proposing a major game-forming idea and seeing if someone will be a jerk and Challenge it, they propose the idea knowing they have to drum up two other peoples' support for it (and have no one Challenge it).

I've used some fairly similar techniques, and I've pretty much always been happy with the outcome. Two backers per idea sounds like about the perfect level of "support", so I foresee that working really well.<br/><br/>I'm a little confused about the various types of contests that can take place, though. <br/><br/>Let's see:<br/><br/>Each player puts one card face up on the table to determine who Directs, etc.<br/><br/>Later, in the scene, the Director can use those cards to Put Up, participate in Challenges, and so on--right? Do we leave the cards on the table?<br/><br/>Next, we seem to have two different types of possible conflicts:<br/><br/>Challenges (between players)<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>Conflicts (between elements of the fiction)<br/><br/>Do they operate the same way?<br/><br/>If it's really just the number of red cards that matters, as in PTA... well, that seems weird to me. Does it mean that all the black cards in your hand are completely useless? Or do you foresee people using them to "bluff"? (That sounds interesting, but there isn't really any incentive to bluff in the game, as far as I can see.)<br/><br/>When you challenge, or try to defend against a challenge, why not just throw away your black cards? It sounds like they aren't good for anything--so it's not much of a loss to spend them.<br/><br/>Using "red cards win", it's effectively like every player having a number of tokens, and bidding a number, with highest winner bidding. That sounds... unsatisfying to me.<br/><br/>And when you pitch in a card from the deck to "swing the vote" on a Conflict, if you draw a black card you're just out of luck, aren't you?<br/><br/>So, is this right, or am I misunderstanding the rules?<br/><br/>The idea of having a few orthogonal ways of using cards is a great idea. I'm not sold on the red/black thing yet, though.<br/><br/>What other options do we have? High/low, matching (pairs, triples), straights/runs, flushes (a variant of matching, I suppose).<br/><br/>Interesting!<br/><br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101611/#Comment_101611" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T04:20:16+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  4:20AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2007 4:32AM by Ry.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, and that's a problem for my first-blush idea of how this works.  <br/><br/>I picture the players using cards as I describe, taking 1 card out for a bid to say "I have a cool idea for the scene, I'll Frame it!" or "Show me what you've got, I'll Direct it!"

The Scene Framer does not need to spend Coins to use a Location that already exists in the game.<br/>\n4)  The Director describes the scene like a GM would in a traditional RPG.  The Director has Control of the characters and Location named by the Scene Framer as being part of the scene (except the Ensemble Cast).  This is true even if the Scene Framer paid Coins to Create the characters or location.<br/>\n5)  Players do not need to spend Coins to narrate Events or create dialogue for characters under their control.  However, a player can Challenge anything in the game even if it is free, and the Challenging side wins ties.<br/>\n6)  The first player who suggests a conflict that is acted on by two sides gets a free Coin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103058/#Comment_103058" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T22:00:01+00:00" title="October 14, 2007 10:00PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, to bring the cards back in:<br><br>I have access to a colour printer and lots of card protectors (like the ones people use to protect their magic cards).<br><br>What I can do is:  Print up 300 or so "cards" with 1-5 in red and 6-10 in black.  I can put whatever designs on them I want, cut them out, slip them into the card boxes with a card behind them for stability, and presto!  Instant Universalis deck.  The cards would be used as Coins and Dice as necessary, with cards dealt face down until the big reveal that would correspond to rolling.<br><br>The reason I'd go 1-5 in red and 6-10 in black is because that way there's this instant visual cue when the cards are turned over as to who won.  Counting Success vs. Failure is trivial when one comes in red and the other in black.<br><br>Now to be honest I won't be able to try to play this until January.  But I think I have the core of it established now.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105077/#Comment_105077" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T20:12:21+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  8:12PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I figured out how to do it with hands of regular-ish playing cards. <br><br>When you spend, you lay down a card for what you're doing (face-up).  Two cards are drawn from the central bank deck and are face down.  To see what happens you have to flip over those cards and make the best hand.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
