So here's a link to it: http://docs.google.com/View?id=dnh2zgr_57cwk9m5f3<br/>\n<br/>\nSome comments about the game itself:<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanically, we like it.  The traits and tags invokes good flavor to the actions -- very easy to imagine Snargle's daredevil piloting for example.  And the keys work well as well.  It took reminding for the first 3-4 times someone hit a key, but after that people were taking experience themselves no problem and I think all of them have enough experience for an advance.  Most of the pools weren't dropping too fast as there were enough failures on the rolls to keep them up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe struggled the most with world building as we go.  There were times when I'd ask them about how something works, or they'd ask me, and we'd have to stop and think about it breaking the flow a bit.  However, this was only a minor issue and we still enjoyed playing and look forward to playing the second session.  But if we were doing a long term campaign rather than just 2-3 sessions I think we'd want more background in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for putting this game together John, we're enjoying it a lot!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215759/#Comment_215759" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T10:51:37+00:00" title="July  1, 2009 10:51AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad you enjoyed it! That write up is great. I love the Dread Pirates (invented by Paul Drussel... an homage to The Princess Bride, I assume) and the side-missions they represent. That's a very nice touch that I'll steal when I run it next. Also, the steam armor and the other bits of color you added to the world are really great.<br/><br/>Looking forward to hearing about session two...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul%20Drussel" title="Paul Drussel"><img alt="Paul Drussel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul%20Drussel">Paul Drussel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216075/#Comment_216075" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T14:54:38+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  2:54PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the Dread Pirates were totally inspired by The Princess Bride.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoyed the write up, looks like you had a good solid session.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question - how did you handle the steam power armour? Purely in the narrative or were there bonus dice given and/or a temporary Trait?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, loved the introduction of the Count, his ship &amp; the escape balloons. That aspect of Lady B just didn't come up when I ran it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nPaul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bhartzell" title="bhartzell"><img alt="bhartzell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bhartzell">bhartzell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216094/#Comment_216094" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T16:21:31+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  4:21PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul--<br>\n<br>\nThe steam power suit was mostly narrative, though I did make it harder for Captain Hollas to shoot Vance due to the protection the suit provided.  Generally, when someone was being shot at I had the resisting player be the only roll.  For example, Snargle evading the gliders shooting at the Owl.  For some reason in this case I rolled a few dice for Hollas rather than Vance rolling to defend and just made the target number for Hollas more difficult due to the protection of the suit.  I should've made it more active on the player -- He could've rolled [Survivor] or [Warrior] with a few bonus tags due to the suit.  If one introduces temporary equipment, I think it should add tags only (no traits) that could be linked to a character's trait via common sense.  Maybe I'll remember to do something like that next time!<br>\n<br>\nTo be honest, I would've forgotten about the Count entirely if they hadn't been talking about it.  And once they were, of course it was the perfect time to bring him in :)  Though I wasn't expecting Lady Blackbird to be quite so bloodthirsty and merciless!<br>\n<br>\nThanks,<br>\nBen                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
