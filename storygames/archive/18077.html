We\u2019re officially associated with Indie Press Revolution, the small press RPG distributor. But we\u2019ve still got some room in our booth, so if you\u2019re not going to make it to PAX East and would like a reliable retailer with many years of dedication to RPGs as part of their business model to sell your products at PAX, whether you\u2019ll be in attendance or not, please get in touch.<br/><br/>We\u2019ve got a 2-booth space proximate to the Indie Games On Demand RPG demo area, and we\u2019ll have a staff of 4 (that's 3 plus me!) drawn from our two stores on-hand to answer questions and handle sales. If you\u2019d like professional references I\u2019d be happy to provide them. Please contact me directly at the address above, or give a call to the store during M-F from 11a-6p at 914-630-4246.<br/><br/>We\u2019re interested in carrying any product with a sales history that we share risk with the publisher/designer on carrying at the show. That can mean consignment, deposit or up-front payment with full or partial returnability, or even simply a deep discount depending on the product. We\u2019ve offered similar services to IPR as well as individual smaller publishers for large Northeast conventions, including Connecticon and the Double Exposure conventions, and have enjoyed good success with the model.<br/><br/>So, if you\u2019re not lucky enough to be attending, or will be there but don\u2019t want to worry about the hassle of running a booth all weekend, please get in touch and hopefully we can work out a deal that gets your product in front of tens of thousands of gamers, many of them new to tabletop gaming, handled by a professional crew passionate about role-playing.<br/><br/>Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>-Jim Crocker, President<br/>Modern Myths, Inc.<br/>www.modern-myths.com<br/>modern.myths.ny@gmail.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408082/#Comment_408082" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T22:48:28+00:00" title="March  4, 2013 10:48PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw, I thought this was Jim Crocker offering me a ride to the con.
