The aesthetic is: ordinary people commit terrible deeds against each other. Yeah, that's not for everyone. I thought of using fixed traits that also communicate something about the sinister nature of the game.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.grimogre.at/michtim/?p=385" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.grimogre.at/michtim/?p=385</a><br/><br/>But now I'm not too sure. My next game should probably be more on the narrative end of the spectrum, so maybe I shouldn't focus on fixed traits. The problem is, if the traits do not cover the interesting aspects of the game, what are they good for?<br/><br/>I also eyed Risus' way of doing things. Maybe I should let players define their traits (roles) themselves and attach dice ratings to them? Like the following character:<br/><br/>Booze-Brained Brawler 4<br/>Desperate Thief 3<br/>Fatherly Protector 2<br/><br/>Matter: 3<br/>Mind: 1<br/><br/>Matter and Mind act as limiters to the amount of dice you can keep on rolls. Matter is for physical actions, Mind for mental/social ones.<br/><br/>What would you advise me to do? Have players pick or define new roles? Maybe come up with an extensive example list? Or would you try to boil down the game experience into traits. Like MH did with Cold / Hot / Volatile / Dark (if I still remember correctly). Each with attached mechanics that are relevant to the game's aesthetics\u2026<br/><br/>I would like to hear your thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430102/#Comment_430102" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T11:55:34+00:00" title="March 27, 2014 11:55AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I should read more about AW/MH's way of doing things.

Monsterhearts is <b>the</b> definitive example of this, I think, with Sagas of the Icelanders being a close second. But it's not just the stats, it's how you use the stats. Monsterhearts gives you the following tools to deal with a complicated situation:<br/><br/>\u2022 Turn Someone On<br/>\u2022 Shut Someone Down<br/>\u2022 Hold Steady<br/>\u2022 Lash Out Physically<br/>\u2022 Run Away<br/>\u2022 Gaze Into the Abyss (and do freaky supernatural stuff)<br/><br/>The game withholds any subtler tools from you. Want to get someone's attention? Looks like you're going to have to elicit their interest (Turn Someone On), butt into a confrontation they're having with a third party (Shut Someone Down), or maybe consult some more sinister authority (Gaze Into the Abyss).<br/><br/>So that's how the game works. (That said, totally play it. It's masterful in its design.) Player-defined traits are ways of customizing the game, giving it a fresh coat of paint, but shouldn't override the main driving attributes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430106/#Comment_430106" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T12:06:35+00:00" title="March 27, 2014 12:06PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I own AW, DW and MH\u2026\xa0and I was enticed by the way things fit together there. <br/><br/>I already have a game with a reduced scope of player actions.

There's a symmetrical, clinical aspect to it that I find appealing, and it's applicable to a huge range of situations, which is great from a GM's perspective.  I'm not sure if I'd show my players the chart with the colored squares on it.  My concern would be this: I think when you have a highly reductive mechanic it can act as a creative filter, leading to that situation where people say the move they're making, rather than describing the action their character takes.  It can also affect the GM.  You want to say/hear what's really going on in the game world, you do not want to say/hear "I'm gonna roll 3 Blood dice using Matter on that guy."<br/><br/>This is not to say anything against reductive or broadly-applicable mechanics.  I love them because they allow you to really quickly take any situation that requires resolution, run it through your mechanic and come back to the fiction again.  But because they have this reductionist quality to them, as a designer they sorta lean on you to ensure, enable or "re-inject" creative detail on other levels (or give that agency to the players/GM <i>and make sure they use it</i>).  One level is the naming of the Stats themselves.  I think this is an important observation you've already made.  The names of Skills, Items, even people, organizations and places can likewise provide color to your world that's more than mere paint - it's actually ontological "exposition".  These words can inform the players about what sorts of operations can be performed in this system, about what types of characters, ideas and activities exist in this world, about how big the narrative space is, and about what is the "flavor" of this game.  This is why AW has "fuck-off big guns".  Another important moment is <i>results interpretation</i> (i.e., as the focus returns to the fiction, coming back from the resolution system).  This is a design challenge that *W solves partly in the phrasing of the moves themselves, and partly in the Principles ("make your move but never say its name", etc).  But there are other ways to solve it of course.<br/><br/>Oh yes, I would agree that making things is probably (usually) Bone.  Bone/Matter would be construction of physical objects, Bone/Mind would be literary, scientific or scholastic endeavor, requiring time and focus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430122/#Comment_430122" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T15:38:06+00:00" title="March 27, 2014  3:38PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some questions I would ask myself when it comes to defining traits in this game, free or not.<br/><br/>1) What's the trigger for a trait?

It runs both ways. Some people might limit themselves to core moves, and this is bad. Others will try to combine elements to find out what they do. Like Blood(Mind Control) tells a different story then Bone(Soldier).<br/><br/>I am willing to find it out. Maybe I can build a character sheet for this to try things. I do think that a sheet can help people to learn (or even master) the game. It should be more than a document to store information. Ideally it offers insights and reminds the player of options.<br/><br/>Of course you cannot put everything into the rules or onto the character sheet. I do think that the system should be open enough for improvisation, and I personally like systems that ease the handling of situations. <br/><br/>Regarding triggers. I think both the player and the GM can trigger a trait. Sometimes the rules will trigger a roll, like when someone tries to dominate your character, you will resist using Bone(Mind) or something appropriate. Depending on the type of domination (eg manipulation, illusion) you might use Flicker(Mind) instead. In most cases the opposites are already defined by the Aspect and the Domain.<br/><br/>A typical trigger could be "player encounters a challenge". The way the player act define the domain and aspect involved, most of the time. So the GM attacks using Blood(matter) and the character could invoke Bone(matter) or something else entirely. Like Shadow(Magick) to blind his foe. Mechanically it's still the same, but it is a different fiction. Players should find reasons to use their unique domains, where appropriate.<br/><br/>In the example above you could try to respond with something out of the ordinary as well, like Bone(Politics) to talk the attacker out of his action. Or what about some precognitive flashes with Flicker(extraterrestrial)? Why not block the attack with Blood(Kenjutsu)?<br/><br/>I think the player needs the Agency to pick his response.<br/><br/>Ages ago I created a karma based diceless system that awarded the player with action karma each time the GM invaded their character' sphere. For big alterations, he player would receive a story karma instead. Players bought changes in the fiction with these two currencies. I might do something similar here as well. Maybe change the way the rolls work. I don't need to include stochastics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430195/#Comment_430195" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T15:31:51+00:00" title="March 28, 2014  3:31PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does the game require a move list for every domain-stat-combination?
