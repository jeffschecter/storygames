                    I notice that BoardGameGeek.com has a "Game recommendations" category. You ask "What's a good game for 2 players for a couple of hours?" and they tell you.<br/>
<br/>
Do we want that here as a category? We do a lot of game recommendation threads anyway, of course, but having its own category might mean people felt freer to ask. <br/>
<br/>
On another note, I think it's a shame that you now have to sign in to see the Little Ideas category. Apologies, Andy, I don't mean to complain about every little change, but I liked being able to look at the site quickly and see what was happening. Needing to sign in to see "Little Ideas" means I don't see that category as often.<br/>
<br/>
Not a huge deal, of course.<br/>

                            I think if people should be encouraged to post that stuff in Games and Gaming all the time.  It doesn't have to be all hoity-toity game design/superplay speak 24/7.  I'm almost hoping people post more "sorta simple and possibly trivial sounding questions and discussions" (and posting my own when I think of them), to encourage that sort of thing. Not Owlbear Fanboys -Like-Threads All The Time, but... y'know... spice.<br/><br/>But I think a recommendation category might be too small at this point to have enough mass to hold threads (ex: I'm probably going to roll S-G Book Club back into Games and Gaming or Little Ideas at some point, it just doesn't have enough mass).<br/><br/>Also, Little Ideas I took behind the scenes to benefit the members: A lot of folks have a lot of cool little ideas they've been posting, and I want to keep those within the community for now. After all, those folks went the extra mile to join and all.<br/><br/>And I think once the 1.0 version of Vanilla comes out, and some of the major bugs are worked out, and I adopt it here... when I turn down the security settings to allow more logins from multiple machines, I think that will remedy the issue of you not being able to see them without logging in: Because the boards will keep you logged in as long as you've used that computer before (ie, like at The Forge or RPGNet).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
