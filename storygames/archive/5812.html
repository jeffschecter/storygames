I've been playing it with my family for a number of years now, and it's become something of a family tradition.  My wife is terrifyingly good at this game, while my dad has this peculiar "werewolf face" that gives him away every time.  It's kind of a mix of gleeful and guilty.  Of course, being a chronic tinkerer, I've added a number of different characters to the game.<br/><br/><b>The Hunter</b><br/>The packaged game has a hunter, but it's lame.  We play that the hunter has three (or as many as there are werewolves in the game) "kills".  The hunter gets a chance to wake up before the werewolves, and point at one person, killing them instantly.  They get tapped, and sit out.  The hunter is cool because it adds confusion to the game when the townsfolk don't know if a death is the result of a rogue hunter, or the werewolves.  On the other hand, a canny hunter can clean up the town really fast.<br/><br/><b>The Sorceress</b><br/>Every night, before the werewolves wake up, the Sorceress gets a chance to cast a spell.  She points at two people (one of which can be herself).  Those two people are tapped.  They wake, acknowledge eachother, and go back to sleep.  Until the sorceress next wakes, anything that would happen to one of the pair, happens to the other instead.  So if the werewolves point at one of them, the moderator taps the other instead.  If the townsfolk lynch one of them, the other one dies in their place.  The sorceress is cool because, well used, the spells can get your enemies killed and save your friends or yourself.  Of course, they frequently backfire and get the sorceress killed.<br/><br/><b>The Necromancer</b><br/>Once per game, the necromancer gets to wake up, and point to a dead person.  The dead person then points to a person who they think is a werewolf.  (We play that dead people get to watch the game, but aren't allowed to comment on it - this can be almost as much fun as playing).  The necromancer is cool because it gets dead people involved in the game some more, gives more information to the villagers, and is thematically awesome.  It's a one-use role though, so it's not so popular.<br/><br/><b>The Flautist</b><br/>This started as a joke, but it's actually a cool role.  We play that the card of dead people isn't revealed until the end of the game, so the townsfolk never know if they've lynched a werewolf or not.  The flautist, however, upon dying, utters a final plaintive piping on a flute.  This doesn't save the Flautist's life, but it lets the townsfolk know they've lynched a villager.  The flautist is cool because it adds some more information to the game, without complicating anything.  You can add the flautist even when you've already got a lot of extra roles in the game.<br/><br/>There should be more RPGs like this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130056/#Comment_130056" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T18:03:55+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  6:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Werewolf is so popular among Ruby programmers that it's even <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/11/is-werewolf-killing-conference-hackfest.html" rel="nofollow">inspired backlash by the less-in-shape/more-programmery clone of John Harper</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus"><img alt="Linnaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.rushcomm.ca/~gcam/Guernica Bull.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130057/#Comment_130057" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T18:10:26+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  6:10PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/forum/76/forum/1" rel="nofollow">forum</a> on Boardgamegeek devoted to playing Werewolf, with some rather baroque variants coming up.<br/><br/>They use a web application for organizing and tracking games called <a href="http://www.thecassandraproject.org/jeremy/werewolf/" rel="nofollow">Cassandra</a>.<br/><br/>There's usually at least five games running at any one time.

I can't believe you played with 20 people and finished in 20 minutes. I used to play Mafia with a bunch of Italians and Romanians, and it was a lot of fun, but it would take us at least an hour and a half (and there were maybe 12 people and no special roles).<br/><br/>By the way, "Mafia" was designed as an experiment for psychology research, or something like that.

Playing a caricature of a cooper who was trying not to get lynched by the mob ("you're making a terrible mistake!" / "that's what a werewolf would say!") is a lot like playing a caricature of an elf wizard.  Oh, but that also might be why it went so fast.  The accusations were flying, people were pounding the table chanting "lynch the mayor! lynch the mayor!"  and so that may have helped us play quickly.  We played 3 games back to back in an hour and only 1 werewolf out of the 6 present was killed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130067/#Comment_130067" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T18:49:53+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  6:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose it does depend how you play it.

All it takes is one player to start talking about in-character stuff, and the everyone catches on and starts doing it too.  On the other hand, all it takes is one person to laugh at the people doing this, or to make obvious use of out-of-character knowledge to make it break apart.  It's interesting also how uncomfortable some people get about Imagined Space if they're not used to it.  I've played with people who literally stopped, looked at the person and said "What are you doing?"  It's not always "gamers" who are most comfortable with imagined space, either.  I tend to prefer the game played "hard", with everyone using all the information available to them, playing to win rather than playing their character.<br/><br/>I think there's a very interesting issue here about competative RPGs and imagined space.  What's the role of imagined space in a competative RPG?

It's a topic done before, but it might be worth revisiting. It certainly is fascinating. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the mechanics of these games... in theory. In practice many of them boil down to one skill - lie-detecting. And what's interesting is that, as a species, we're pretty well adapted to lying well. Oh, we're also pretty well adapted to discerning when somebody lies. But the end effect is that often you're just guessing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich isn't much of a game at all. That is, as a competitor, you need to have multiple opporitunities to show off whatever ability it is that the game highlights. If, in fact, most people are essentially guessing like 80% of the time, the randomness of those results skew any perception of actual ability on the other 20%. And you'll never know who is a better player than another. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust which is luckier. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you might as well just flip a coin to see who wins. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that's for the simplest versions. In some of the more complex versions there might be combinations of abilites that skew the odds one way or another, and determining when this is true is a test of people's logic abilities. Yes, I know that folks find this tedious, but for me it's the only way to salvage such a game for serious play. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor an icebreaker, the simple versions are fine, and play fast enough for it not to matter if it's a skill game or not. But for anything else, I strongly recommend using as complicated a rules-set as possible. What's interesting is that they're typically not all that much more difficult to understand how to play, as often the complexity simply comes about from the number of extra abilities in the game. Meaning that each player can easily learn their individual role. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaking it an "Easy to Learn, difficult to master" sort of game. Which I think is optimum. But which many people dislike. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130166/#Comment_130166" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T08:40:16+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  8:40AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Mike again, except for this:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>So you might as well just flip a coin to see who wins.</blockquote>But that's not a reveal.

One of the advantages of our play-by-post version is that each day lasts an actual day. We've also developed some sophisticated techniques to give Team Good a better chance. For example, it's SOP now that everyone does a full coded reveal right out of the gate. That is, we code our roles using a Vigenere cipher; when everyone has disseminated their coded role, we reveal our roles. Obviously, members of Team Evil claim fake roles. Occasionally, you get a member of Team Good faking their role too (which invariably causes delicious fireworks). We have a lot of professionals who play and, invariably, miss swaths of time in the middle of the day; of course, we also have people "missing time" because they are trying to lay low. Also, we play with multiple werewolves and have 50+ roles. Many times, the moderator (which rotates) will develop new roles and rules just for that game. One game, I had an alchemist who could make potions to ward of werewolf bites and a blacksmith who could make silvered arrows to kill werewolves. Sometimes, we do different themes. We had a game based off Survivor with an immunity idol and an exile island.<br/><br/>So, there are a lot of other skills at work. Selecting fake roles, considering the metagame (e.g., what roles would Justin put in this game), when to post, etc.<br/><br/>I've been meaning to post our e-Werewolf rules for some time. Maybe this thread is just the thing to get me off my butt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130197/#Comment_130197" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T09:32:25+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  9:32AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Post em!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130202/#Comment_130202" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T09:40:34+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  9:40AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do it!

Yes, I know that the original game has the scryer position, which is asymetrical with the rest of the positions. Even that bugs me a tiny bit, truth be told. But it's not too bad, because it has an elegance of it being a single exception. Basically the person who gets that position is the lottery winner, and we don't begrudge the lottery winner. From another POV, with that position singled out, the scryer becomes a target, and has more responsibility and pressure, so it could almost be seen as a negative in some ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf/when you kill that elegance by having many of the positions have powers, then the problem is that the folks who get to be plain-jane werewolves, or plain-jane villagers are going to feel unlucky. I would. Like, "Oh, there are lots of powers out there.. but I don't get one." Worse, there are positions that are just more likely to get you killed out of the game for no benefit to you at all. These folks are really unlucky. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike Comatose in your set. Lets see, I don't get to talk with the other players the first day, and then I'll automatically die at some point thereafter. All this does is limit the player's interaction with the game. Yes, I see how it makes for a more complex game overall, and that I applaud. But, while it makes the game better for other players, it makes it worse for the player who gets the position. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not to say that I'm against these sorts of game effects existing. That is, it is interesting to have a character who can't speak the first day in some ways. But I'd have that fault as part of a position that also gives some offsetting powerful advantage. Perhaps the comatose character, having been attacked by the werewoves, gets to know the identity of one werewolf when he comes out of the coma. Or something like that - that's just off the top of my head. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game will contiune to be asymetrical (and asymetrical is a good thing), even if the powers are balanced, simply because the powers are different from each other. Personally I'd always be designing toward making each role give the player more interaction, not less. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some things that your rules doc doesn't seem to cover. Is there a more exensive one (this one is a summary, right)? For instance it's not clear if the players know all of the potential roles. Do they have a list of powers? Is this list one of potential powers, or of the powers that are definitely included in the game? <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm fascinated by the idea that you have players give out their roles at the beginning. I think that's a great idea, especially thematically (the idea of a village where nobody knows who the other villagers are, even putatively, is really weird). And you'd think that there would be a demand from the good side that this happen anyhow. But procedurally, how does this occur? What's up with the code? Why is that important? Why can't everybody just send the moderator their role claim, and then he reveals them all (I understand that making one player do it before another is unneccessarily complex and punitive). What am I missing there?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, while I'm at it, the rule that everything happens simultaneously at night is as broken as the original Magic:the Gathering timing rules. Sorry. That is, looking at your example, scrying a participant who is killed doesn't tell me anything. That is, it supposes that I can't scry a dead character? First, the rules don't indicate that specifically, though some of the language about players killed being out of play might read that way (note that in a lot of versions, being dead doesn't put you out of play at all). Second, even if that's the case, then why is the scry allowed in this case? In fact, the rule before it says "this may result in some powers negating others." I was thrown for a loop when the example that followed was one of a power NOT being negated. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure that the negation seems logical to you, but let me posit that, from the rules you've written, there's no way to know. If a scryer can't scry a dead character, then If the scry happens before the character is dead, it works. If it happens after the character is dead, it's negated. If it happens "simultaneously"... <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know. I could rule that they both occur, or that the one negates the other. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this can't be "abused" because it's adjudicated by the moderator. But the problem is that, as moderator, I'm not going to know how to adjudicate the situation. Worse, the player doesn't know, so he can't use that information in his decision-making.* <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of solutions I can think of off the top:<br/>\n1. Have an order of resolution - and publish it. That way players will know what their chances of negation are going against certain characters. If their scry is going to be disrupted by the wolves eating, then they will try to predict somebody who they think is not going to be eaten, or take the calculated risk to target one who might. This one is only possible assuming you distribute a list of powers before play. The example version of the game from the Boardgamegeek link above with 100 roles has an order of resolution presented.<br/>\n2. FIFO - First In, First Out - process the orders in the order you recieve them. This creates a lot of strategy on timing. Do I delay getting my order in, or do I try to get it in first? Usually it's going to be getting the order in early, to avoid being negated. This has the advantage that it incentivizes players to be prompt with their orders. You have the advantage of having email time-stamps to help figure out which order was sent first (use send time, not arrival time - don't punish your Patagonian player for internet lag in Honduras!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther models like FILO would work (this is what M:TG used last time I looked), but might cause odd strategies. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n*There are times when random-ness plays a good role in games, but as the game is otherwise completely non-random - outside of some powers - it seems a shame to go against that. In fact you might want to consider taking the randomness out of those currently random powers. Instead of the Inn-keeper learning the role of a random villager, he might learn the role of the first player to declare he's staying at the inn (which could have a protection effect or something). You get the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131232/#Comment_131232" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T10:59:41+00:00" title="February 28, 2008 10:59AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Question: Are there variants of this game that don't require a "moderator"?</blockquote>\nYes, start with daytime and lynch someone (presume the "first werewolf attack" happened "off-screen"). That person Moderates henceforth.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>In practice many of them boil down to one skill - lie-detecting.</blockquote>\nI dunno about this, and I've had rather a lot of such practice--Demo Rabbit for Looney Labs for a few years now (running AYAW? at cons) and a past player of regular Mafia game back in the mid-nineties.<br/><br/>On the surface, yes, there's lazy guesswork, the Werewolves have to lie, the Villagers have to detect.<br/><br/>In practice, there's a ton of use of senses, to hear things during the night in spite of noise-making and to see subtle glances and gestures during the day; one comes to know the other players and learns to read them; one must keep people's assertions straight, in particular during the factioning which often occurs; and, of course, role playing. I actually LOVE to Moderate (as I have what I feel is an unfair advantage over average con-goers) because I slip into this stentorian half-preacher, half-judge role, to the amusement of most participants. There's often someone who gets into it too, acting the Mayor or Town Fool or what-not.<br/><br/>One quick anecdote about its popularity: At DragonCon this year, I started up AYAW? with another Demo Rabbit, with a single Town of about 12. It was around 5pm on Saturday, IIRC. Within an hour, we had two towns with over 15 each. By 9 or so: three of 20. I left, exhausted (12 hours demoing that day) at 1am: two towns of about 12 each. I GOT BACK AT ABOUT NOON THE NEXT DAY AND THEY WERE STILL PLAYING! Yes, nearly 20 hours straight, with people coming and going.<br/><br/>Short point: there's more to it than I think you realize, Mike.<br/><br/>On Roles:<br/>It's the opinion of the Looneys (AYAW?) that only the Seer is a "good" or "fun" role; they see the game as finely-balanced and, thus, too easily "tipped" by odd roles. I am ambivalent on this point, having enjoyed both ways.<br/><br/>Obviously, there's a bajillion others available, with positive and negative aspects. And mechanically speaking, there's only so many mechanical hooks onto which you can hang roles--most roles just "break" or "rewrite" a basic rule, for one person. (Ex: A VERY popular role at cons is The Little Girl, who may peek during the night but, if caught by the Wolves, is instantly killed. I am a fucking EXPERT Little Girl--I routinely am killed when I announce "I'm the Little Girl and him, him, and her are the Wolves,: then commit suicide by showing my LG card.)<br/><br/>On History:<br/>Far be it from me to contradict Zarf, but I *think* the Princeton crew added Werewolves (using Clubs instead of the Mafia's Spades; hence "wolves" because it looks like a paw. IIRC.) to be able to have competing evil groups, i.e. it's Wolves v Mafia v Villagers, last one standing wins. That's actually a REAL cool game, because of the "circle of death" effect and deal-making (the Mafia wants to help the Villagers... for a while).<br/><br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Some roles were developed to address very specific play issues. For example, we have a guy who wants to play but can only play for the first three days. So we come up with a role whose \u201cpower\u201d is that he dies after the third day.\n<blockquote>There are some things that your rules doc doesn't seem to cover.

I don\u2019t have a more extensive written one, but I can answer questions to help get to that point. Generally, the players get the latest copy of the role sheet. They do not know what specific roles are being used in that game (which gives Team Evil a place to hide), but they do know what roles can potentially be used and they know what all the roles\u2019 abilities are. Occasionally, one of us (usually me) will run a truly custom game, in which case everything gets thrown out the window and, generally, role powers are not known. For example, I did a Norse-themed one (which accounts for the Seiokona, Lokison, etc.), an Oriental Adventures-themed one (which is not reflected in the role sheet\u2014I should upload that separately), etc.\n<blockquote>I'm fascinated by the idea that you have players give out their roles at the beginning.

At this point, the procedure is basically: \u201cEveryone knows the drill, code your role.\u201d Then everyone gets around to coding and posting their coded role. Once everyone has posted, we reveal. The reason we don\u2019t use the moderator is purely historical. In our games, the moderator doesn\u2019t interact with the players in that way, i.e., dealing in in-game information. I will say that coding has produced some entertaining moments in its own right. For example, we used to just code, but one of the players was able to use a spreadsheet to crack some of the codes. Now we double-code. You get people making mistakes with their code, e.g., coding too few letters or screwing up their code.\n<blockquote>Also, while I'm at it, the rule that everything happens simultaneously at night is as broken as the original Magic:the Gathering timing rules.

And you can imagine how important that is for a version of the game that is not played face-to-face. Lots of logic-based strategies come into play.

Some things are a bit more clear (especially how the knowledge of the roles is dealt with). But I'm afraid that I don't understand some things, and others I think I disagree with. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the point about multiple werewolves: Interesting about the strategy. But I think I'm missing the point. Is it that the werewolves claiming to be a scryer lead to a need for more positions? <br/>\n<br/>\nPseudo Villagers: so... you agree with me that giving a power is superior to not doing so, if you're going to give out more than the Scryer? Rather that not having a power is less fun? <br/>\n<br/>\nSpecial Roles for Special Needs: OK, so player X can only play for three days. Why make him unable to communicate on the first day? Punishment for not playing the whole game? ;-)   Again, why not compensate the player instead? <br/>\n<br/>\nRole Declaration: Do I understand correctly that the reason for the role declarations to be made in code is to make the declarations simultaneously, sans GM? Or is there some other reason that I'm missing? <br/>\n<br/>\nContradictory Powers fixing Timing Issues: I'm skeptical, not knowing the entire set. There may be timing issues that have nothing to do with "negation." But instead with what information is gleaned. Like a character is simultaneously tranformed from a villager into a werewolf, and scryed. Does the character show as villager or werewolf? It's possible that all of your roles have been written so as to avoid anything like this. But unforseen combos can make this difficult to imposible. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the very least the way these parts of the rules are written seems confusing to me. There has to be a simpler way to put it.

But I think I'm missing the point. Is it that the werewolves claiming to be a scryer lead to a need for more positions?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure I understand the question exactly. If you're referring to the Kill-the-Seers/Save-the-Seers, the answer is sort of? After playing, like, 10 games in succession the strategy in a game with the same roles starts to become static. So, we developed additional roles, inter alia, to freshen up the strategies for Team Evil. For awhile, this tipped the scales in their favor until Team Good's strategies evolved (including the coded reveal). Now, we're pretty balanced.\n<blockquote>Pseudo Villagers: so... you agree with me that giving a power is superior to not doing so, if you're going to give out more than the Scryer? Rather that not having a power is less fun?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely. But it's important to remember that a "power" doesn't just have to be something flashy, e.g., the Seer. One game, I came up with a new role triad of pseudo-villagers, whose only power was that they could confirm the identity of one of the other members of the triad. (I forget the names) but let's say: Miller, Blacksmith, Butcher. The Miller's power was that he knew the Blacksmith was not a WW; the Blacksmith knew the Butcher was not a WW; and the Butcher knew the Miller was not a WW. This was before coded reveal was a firm strategy. So it was very interesting for this triad to be revealed organically during the course of the game. And, of course, it's actually a very powerful block of information.\n<blockquote>Special Roles for Special Needs: OK, so player X can only play for three days. Why make him unable to communicate on the first day? Punishment for not playing the whole game? ;-) Again, why not compensate the player instead?</blockquote>\nSeriously, don't read anything into these. It was probably based off one of the attorneys who was going to be in meetings on day one or something. Although, this does bring up another little wrinkle I added one game. In addition to their roles, I gave every player a "speech requirement", e.g., you must use at least three exclamation points in each post, you must misspell at least two words in each post, you must speak "in character" for the whole game, etc. That was a lot of fun, principally because no one was expecting it and it had not mechanical effect on the game but drew a lot of attention.\n<blockquote>Role Declaration: Do I understand correctly that the reason for the role declarations to be made in code is to make the declarations simultaneously, sans GM? Or is there some other reason that I'm missing?</blockquote>\nCorrect. Or at least as "simultaneously" as you can be on posting. That's why it's coded, so a member of Team Evil can't wait to reveal and avoid duplicating another claimed role. Last game was the first time in a long while the coded reveal actually snared a duplicate role.\n<blockquote>Contradictory Powers fixing Timing Issues: I'm skeptical, not knowing the entire set. There may be timing issues that have nothing to do with "negation." But instead with what information is gleaned. Like a character is simultaneously tranformed from a villager into a werewolf, and scryed. Does the character show as villager or werewolf? It's possible that all of your roles have been written so as to avoid anything like this. But unforseen combos can make this difficult to imposible.<br/><br/>At the very least the way these parts of the rules are written seems confusing to me. There has to be a simpler way to put it. That is, calling them simultaneous I think is what's screwing me up. And the example... the power of the werewolves does not indicate that it negates anything... so why would one even think that it would be negated? Unless you can't scry a dead character. Which may be true, but not stated anywhere that I saw.</blockquote>\nYou're obviously right that, if I were releasing the game commercially, I'd want to nail done more specific role power hierarchy to resolve conflicts. I'd probably assign each role a tag and identify which tags supersede others. Since I wasn't releasing it commercially, we just sort of go with the flow. To clarify, dead players are out of the game and can't be scried unless specifically identified in the role power, e.g., the Priest.<br/>\n<blockquote>From your POV... do dead characters win if their side wins? Or is it only the live people on the winning team? This is part to do with the question of whether dead folks are still in the game effectively, and also... I think I'd prefer it if only live people won. This means that there's intra-team competition not to be the target, too. If it's a choice between your team-mate dying, and an enemy dying, you'll chose your team-mate if this is true. Right?<br/><br/>Does that work? Do people play that way?</blockquote>\nWe don't. It might be interesting to try. My gut feeling is that it's so tough for Team Evil as it is that the additional chaos would tip things too far in their favor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131541/#Comment_131541" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T06:29:12+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  6:29AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks so much for all the feedback, Justin.

So, at seven players, most moderators would add a second WW. Of course, evil minions can be a good balancer without adding WWs. In a six player game, for example, you'd probably use 1 WW and 1 evil minion.<br/><br/>By way of example as to the abstractness, we once had a game where everyone was a "Lone Wolf" WW except me. That was interesting. I once ran a game (the Norse-themed one) where the "WW" didn't know they were the WW. They thought they were a "Villager", and the WW's mistress made his eating choices for him. Another fun one. We've even done games with randomized role powers. IIRC, the blacksmith who made silvered arrows (mentioned upthread) gave the person with a silver arrow a 50% chance of killing the WW if it tried to eat them. (And, we had one WW, the "Werelion" as I recall, that was immune to silver arrows.) ....<br/><br/>The way our game has evolved, about half of the games are really about broad experimentation in game setup, just doing wild shit and seeing what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131612/#Comment_131612" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T09:08:12+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  9:08AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

Jacobson</cite>I'd probably assign each role a tag and identify which tags supersede others.</blockquote>Neat idea. Of course, you'd also have a basic rule something like "a core game rule always precedes a role ability" which solve the death + scry simultaneity issue (which, actually, is not an issue in the live game--if you scry a person in the night whom the wolves have planned to kill that night, then you've wasted a night of scrying).<br/><br/>And then just number the role cards, with the basic rule that "lower-numbered role cards occur first." Or you could use role-typing to sort precedence, if you want a lot of nuanced variety within the standard role types (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game)#Optional_roles" rel="nofollow">link</a>).<br/><br/>Next, it seems like you two are talking with the rule presumption that a victim--day or night--isn't revealed (another case of how "scrying the dead" is a non-issue). I've never played that way; rather, we always play it that if you die then you show your card. I suppose the dramatic tension is more extended (but maybe not as peaked) with no reveals; but we play for the cheers and groans and eventual high-tension of "pick right or lose" which (I should think) would not happen if there was never any reveals: the Wolves would all be "in the know" during the critical lynching vote, while the soon-to-be-outnumbered and -overrun remaining villagers wouldn't even know it was now or never (as they don't know how many wolves remain).<br/><br/>I might have to experiment with no reveals, next con, to see which I and my players prefer.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>If it isn't obvious, I'm thinking of putting together my own version.

Hell, consider reskinning--Mafia, Werewolves... what other "hidden villains in our midst" can you think of? Body Snatchers, maybe...? Ooo! with cool 70s art vibe, for the nostalgia thing! One thing I strongly recommend: you ought to put the gist of the roles' rules on their cards... BUT, if you have any vanilla Villagers roles--and why not? The game really will get slow and possibly wacky, with everyone having some kind of night or day action to take!--be SURE they have some kind of blurb or quote or "fluff" to read. Otherwise--and I see this ALL the time--players that are still learning the roles will give themselves away when they check their cards, as only "weird" roles require more than a glance to ascertain: those players doing a lot of reading will be the first to be eaten. But not if every card has something that is somewhat compelling to read on it.<br/><br/>Basically, this could be a pretty short project, mainly consisting of coordinating artists, developing a card layout, and working with a print provider. I would have done something years ago, but I am disinclined to put out a product that competes with Looney Labs. I have all-but-begged them to put out an expansion to <i>Are You A Werewolf?</i>, because invariably at cons, someone busts out a totally custom, hand-made deck to get other roles... and, then, the Looney Labs demo area is chock full of folks playing a game with no visible Looney branding. They have declined to invest in the project at this time.<br/><br/>Anyhow... you make a cool, colorful MafiaWolf (hey, do both, like in Princeton!! The three-way game is WAY cooler!) deck, with a ton of (optional) roles and <i>a good analysis or chart showing when to add which roles</i> (critical for scaling by number of players) then I'll buy it and demo it. Ooo! You're numbering role cards anyway, right? So you could just let the number indicate the number of players; i.e. a 15-player game uses 15 of the roles that are numbered 1 to 15 (any roles with matching numbers must be non-conflicting roles, to solve simultaneity issue). Voila! No need for a chart, just have to enumerate roles based on determined, ideal ratios (ex: Wolves will typically be roles 8, 15, 22, and 29; Mafia might be 7, 14, 21 and 28; Seers are 1, 16, and 30 (or 30 is Devil); Guardians at 13 and 26; etc...). One tuck box and you've got gold for upwards of 60 players, though I'd do it as two full decks for 30 players, as thats about the maximum number of players that one can reasonably Moderate.<br/><br/>Go forth and do it!

But I'll have to do playtesting on the set before I would even consider publishing it. So it might take a while for me to get groups organized to play. But I agree it seems like a really simple project...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have another subject that's bugging me. I like really elegant games where stuff like the following is made impossible. Particularly, I was troubled by your description, Dave, of how you played the little girl role. That is, there seem to be a lot of metagame assumptions that are not in the various rule-sets I've seen. In the case of your example, you imply that there's a rule that says that if you reveal your role, you die. That's opposed to the rules I've read which say that it's against the rules to expose your role. Basically what you're doing sounds like cheating by those rules. Obviously you don't consider it to be so? Does the set of rules you were playing by indicate that it's an option to reveal your role? <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking I would not allow this. The problem is that it's not easy to monitor player's handling of the cards (especially if the group is large and mingles). It's easy to cheat during the day phase and flash somebody your card when nobody else is looking. As a villager, with only your moderator and the werewolves to detect this cheating, and the other villagers having no incentive to turn you in (other than fair play), it makes detection of this cheating difficult. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most elegant solution I can think of is to take away the player's card. They can keep their sheet with the list of powers on it, and what they do, and refer to that, having only to recall which role they have. And if/when that's problematic, the moderator can help out (I'm assuming that this happens anyhow). <br/>\n<br/>\nAny problems with that? The moderator would hand out the cards, recording each one as he did so, and then the player would memorize which role they were assigned, and hand the card back. Yeah, it's cool to leave the card in the hands of the player, as a reference, and to make more use of the cards as artifacts of play (if one can think of them). But I really prefer not to tempt players. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there are other ways to do this. But whatever I come up with seems like more trouble than just giving the players a sheet with all of the powers on it. Thoughts on brilliant ways that you can simultaneously enable players to see their card, but make it impossible for them to reveal it to others? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother area of detection that I worry about seems even more problematic. Note, again, the Little Girl. If she peeks, and detected, she is killed. That's a fine exception. But it implies, in this case, that the rule is that its illegal to peek. Cheating. Only the little girl may do so (and there's even a repercussion if she's caught). How do you prevent peeking? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe real problem with both of these is detection. Even if you have somebody with a vested interest in catching cheaters, it's still problematic to do so. You might just miss it - there need to be ways to verify that a player is not cheating in all cases possible. Worse, a player who is obviously trying to detect players cheating says something about their priorities. In these games, that may well reveal your side. Leaving only the moderator to do detection (and his interest isn't as strong as that of an opponent). Worster, since there's probably no way for a moderator to verify a claim of cheating (he has to have seen it too), he has to take one side's word over another. Leading to a he-said, she-said situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nDetection is just not feasible. And therefore I worry that players will try to get away with this. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again, I'd like to eliminate the possibility of peeking. And, actually, there are some obvious ways. Justin's online game makes peeking impossible, for instance. For a face-to-face game, instead of having people close their eyes for the werewolf hunting phase, have everybody hand in a piece of paper with a name on it. Counting only the votes of the werewolves to determine who is actually killed. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this is a little more work than neccessary otherwise, and you do lose out on the fun physical nature of the werewolf hunt. Can anyone come up with a better solution to how you can make it impossible to peek at the werewolves without being easily detected doing so (or peeking at any other player using any other power)? Blindfolds, maybe like sleep masks? Something easy on and off, but which would really make it impossible to see, and would make it obvious if somebody were trying? <br/>\n<br/>\nOr is there some way to enable secret communication methods amongst the werewolves and the moderators? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I don't want to get into that lame discussion about "you shouldn't play with players who would cheat" (I'm sure somebody will chime in with a report that it's never been a problem in their game). There's a metagame to such stuff that makes players think that cheating is part of the game in some ways - otherwise great players can be tempted to go down this road. Game Theory dictates that, when feasible, you should eliminate the profitability of cheating. I won't damage the game to get these things, but I will go to some inconvenience to prevent cheating, yes. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131675/#Comment_131675" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T11:54:25+00:00" title="February 29, 2008 11:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Werewolf/Rules.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Werewolf/Rules.html</a><br/>Yep, I was cheating. Humph... Seers do it all the time, too; we gotta be sure to remind folks of that no-show rule!<br/>Note also that those rules DO show the card on every lynching, and DO show who the werewolves kill in the night--death eliminates one from play.<br/><br/>Taking away the card would work--now, folks could only SAY they are some-such role, but not prove it. Could be a problem if the roles are easily confused (Archangel v Angel, in Mafia). But, nope, there's now way to prevent cheating by peeking, other than Moderator being very alert and insta-killing anyone caught. Such issues are often a problem with LARPs, no matter how simple or small. Voting MIGHT work, but the werewolves are supposed to vote unanimously (but see the Alpha Wolf role).<br/><br/>Don't laugh, but what about an opaque paper bag over everyone's heads, which everyone taps or shuffles, for the nighttime noise-making? Thus, when a night role is called to point out someone for whatever function (eat, scry, protect, etc), the sound of the actor(s) shifting their bag up high enough to see out from under them should be pretty much obfuscated by all the other ffolks tapping and rattling their own bags (and also thereby mostly deafening themselves, to boot!). AND that makes the Little Girl a lot tougher to pull off, as she risks calling a LOT of attention to herself at night, shifting her bag up on her head.<br/><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-size: xx-small;">*ahem* Cheating has never been a problem, in all my years of demoing and playing.

(<a href="http://www.playagaingames.com/games/advanced_werewolf" rel="nofollow">link</a>) for another solution to "Who Moderates?"\n<blockquote><b>No First Night Kill:</b> On the first night, the moderator has the werewolves open their eyes and find each other, and then close their eyes, without mauling anyone. The seer stays asleep, without getting a vision. We feel it is hard enough being a werewolf without the seer having one more vision. We actually play this round without a moderator. One of the players can say the lines while everyone has their eyes closed. "Werewolves open your eyes. Find each other." The player waits a few seconds, and says "Werewolves, close your eyes." The player waits a little longer and say, "Everyone open your eyes." The player who says the lines may or may not actually be a werewolf. This is great when everyone wants to play, because you don't need a non-player moderator. Unless the players fail to lynch someone, the first player lynched becomes the moderator for the next night.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131721/#Comment_131721" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T13:06:38+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  1:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, thanks for the link. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm assuming that an alteration to the rules is neccessary to empower all of those roles that can scry dead folks.

Cool! What are they? Do they use (or at least support) a three-way conflict (e.g. Mafia v Wolves v Citizens)?<br/><br/>Got me wanting to brainstorm skins, now....<br/>-----<br/>You can playtest it out, but it's my gut instinct that never revealing the dead will heavily favor the Wolves (and/or Mafia). Especially if your scryer(s) waste effort revealing dead people. Additionally, you can check out the role-addition progression at the aforementioned "custom card" site, but it is also my gut instinct that you'd only add a scryer every 15 players or so--there's certainly only one in AYAW, which is balanced for 15 players.<br/>---<br/>One thing upon which we haven't touched is Protector roles: though all make their choices at night (to protect the Protector's identity), one is "protect at night" (i.e. from Mafia or Wolves) and the other is "protect from lynching" (i.e. daytime, from the Citizens). There's also a "protect self at night ("Bulletproof Vest")". Any one of these can lead to a stalemate: one Wolf/Mafia v one Protector. The AYAW rules bypass this stalemate because when "the number of werewolves and villagers is equal, ...the werewolves overrun the villagers, killing them off openly." I reckon any new release using Protectors would want to make this crystal clear, as well (and, likewise, make it clear who wins if it 1 Wolf v 1 Mafia v 1 Citizen).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132534/#Comment_132534" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T06:11:56+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  6:11AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2008 6:50AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the ideas is an alien infestation concept (not too dissimilar from the Thing entry). Everyone is arriving separately to investigate a derelict ship that sent out a distress signal. This way no character knows the other characters, so it makes internal sense that they can't identify each other's roles. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm somewhat ambivalent about doing a three-way concept. But I'll consider it. For the derelilct ship... I dunno... two sorts of aliens fighting in the ship? Like AVP? I dunno, doesn't thrill me. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe second idea is that a feudal Japanese lord has been forced to hire ronin. But some of those that he has hired have turned out to be ninja, hired by the lord's opposition to wipe out this new force. Not sure about a third side for this one... (pirates? Just kidding)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm keeping the other of the concepts secret for now (for reasons that I'll explain at a later date)... that one would be more conducive to three ways. <br/>\n----<br/>\nI'm quite sure that not revealing whether or not a character's role on death favors the werewolves, yes. So I will have to balance out in favor of the villagers if I do this. But there are two reasons for doing this. First, most of the concepts don't really make sense with death being revealing. For instance, if you kill a ninja, how do you know he was a ninja? Second, what this allows is for roles that can perform this determination. This helps balance (though knowing with certainty, instead of having to trust a character is far more powerful), and gives another area to play around with in terms of the rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne area I'm working on, is that of death in general. Mostly it takes players out of play early. With a simple game this isn't too big a deal (especially if you have time limits on the phases). You can finish up and play again. But with the complexities I'm adding, I'm expecting a longer game. And getting eliminated from a longer game early is just not fun. The simplest thing I can imagine is to use some of the ideas for making dead characters "converts." Like the vampire rules you see here and there. If they dead are made into vampires, then they cannot vote in the day (if they're known to be dead, but still walking around and voting, they're obviously vampires!), so they don't count towards victory. But they can still participate in terms of trying to get other characters offed, and potentially still winning. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nAs for "protection" I'm working with several sets for ideas, all of which include such concepts and more (as well as other sources of inspiration like Cosmic Encounters). To be clear, the set I create is going to be pretty complex, and, while it'll obviously show it's roots, I'm trying to innovate here and there (so it's a little more than a skin change). So there may be some things you've not yet seen, in addition to the complexities you may have seen in other sets. <br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nAnd I'll try to keep the rules as elegant as possible, but also as rigorous. I really hate it, for instance, when a rule-set doesn't say what to do in cases of ties, etc. I try to cover all the bases. <br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132617/#Comment_132617" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T09:27:52+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  9:27AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see the 'no reveal on death" as an element of verisimilitude for a particular type of adversary(ies). Makes sense. but it *will* have to be well-balanced, to adjust for how that favors the adversaries.<br/><br/>May I put in a vote for "good art," too? Seems an obvious call... until one looks around at the product offerings in this game space. (Hate to say it, but, yes, even the Looneys.) I am betting you know a gaming artist or two, and even a MegaComplex Variant is going to have--what?--at most about 30 "portraits" (and probably more like 10 or 15, with duplicates)?<br/><br/>And to reiterate: if you have role rules on cards, have ALL cards with some kind of text, even if only flavor text (I'd be glad to help with "blurbs," if you like!). THis avoids the "he must have Role Foo because it took him so long to read it" problem.<br/><br/>And if you've got a concept which works three-way, I'd recommend favoring it--you can ALWAYS drop on adversary faction, for smaller or simpler games; but it's impossible to add roles (well, not without doing ugly shit like sleeving all cards and using post-it notes, or something). Additionally, nearly any premise could be made to support three-way faction play:\n<ul>\n<li>Body Snatchers: Our Earth is merely the most-recent battleground in a war between the Vaylen and the Dopplegangers, both of which assume or subvert the form of indigenous life, the better to survive the environment type and infiltrate defenses. (This is great, by the way, for Never Die, Only Convert play, though that could open up an infinite loop of alternating conversions.)<br/></li><li>Ronin, Ninja, and Spies: Band of ronin, being infiltrated by the emperor's ninjas, who want to eliminate the threat, and by turncoat Nipponese spies for the British Empire, who want to see BOTH factions dead, the better to weaken Japan for eventual assimilation into their System of the World. (Obviously, this is a Die And Out flavor.)<br/></li></ul>\nJust wave your hands about a bit, and you can three-way any imagined "strictly two-way" factional conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132904/#Comment_132904" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T08:09:22+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  8:09AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry I didn't reply to your points before. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, if/when I finish this up and send it to be published, I will definitely have art for it. Good art, I agree. I'm thinking, in fact, of rather iconic stuff. But I'm open to other ideas. Any artist interested in the project should contact me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm targetting more like 50-100 roles (at least for the one design), with no duplicates. The concept that I have is that every player has a unique and approximately as empowered role. So that might be quite a bit of art. That said, playtesting may eliminate many of these, and the set might get tighter as I design it. It's not easy to come up with this many powers that aren't just slight variations of each other. Like I don't want one role to be "Can protect one character per night" and another be "can protect one character one night per game." That's just a weaker version of the first, and doesn't add a lot that's interesting. Whereas, "Can protect a character one time" vs "can protect a character indefinitely, but it's announced publicly that the character is being protected" are sufficiently balanced and different roles. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, every card will have text, because every card will be a role with it's own power. Right now, in fact, I'm thinking the card will have:<br/>\nTeam: if this team wins, the player wins. <br/>\nPower: the effect the role can have on the game. <br/>\nOrder: the order in which this power is used. <br/>\nColor Text: a brief blurb on how/why the role has the power in question, and it's nature. ("The Death Ronin has never been defeated in battle, and some say he is invincible.")<br/>\n<br/>\nThe order is to make players have to try to plan against suspected powers. Makes the game more tactically interesting, and resolution simpler. You just do one power at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I can't disagree with you that any concept can be forced to have a third side, I think it's ugly to do so just out of a desire to have a third faction. That is, I agree with you that having a third faction is good for the set, yes, and can make for better play... it at the very least creates more options for play. But I'd rather figure out a "skin" that fits this well thematically, and then create around it. Rather than take a good two-sided conflict, and force another role on hit in a hand-wavey fashion. <br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately, my third (secret) concept works just fine with three factions. In fact, I'm thinking of a version that allows for N factions, determined before play (practically speaking about 5 or 6). <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the body-snatchers one works... so-so. Yeah it's a high premise already, so adding more to it won't seem like deliberate laser-sharking of the game. But the premise should be more like "Both sides have been on Earth for a long time. But an Earth scientist has discovered a way to find out who are aliens, and who are not... and now both of the alien groups want the device." This sets up the plot in a more "plausible" way. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Brittish spies version doesn't work at all for me. Too James Clavel... Maybe in China with the Boxer Rebellion. Or two Ninja bands, both lords fighting, with the ninja in between sounds like it has better legs to me. Might be fun to have two open teams, instead of two hidden teams. But you could also do two ninja teams, both competing to obtain the payment for slaying the lords Ronin. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure it can be worked out. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the "Convert" play, there would have to be some additional mechanical effect that moves the game toward a finish, yes. To avoid infinitely long games. A very simple one is a turn limit. That could drain suspense of one side gets ahead, however - this game has a race to finish quality that's superior that I'd like to keep. Another idea is that of a "key role." Each side wins if they convert their key objective character (If side B captures the character that Side C is after from Side A, then Side C now has to capture them from Side B). This has the downside of a potential early win on a good guess (again, making it less of a race). Each side could have scoring... if you capture a character from the other side, you get to score one "info point" about the other side's operation, a point you do not lose if you lose your operative. First side to X points wins... yes, this requires balancing between open and hidden teams. But it's just an example. <br/>\n<br/>\nLots of ways you could do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo here are basic "elimination" models, with one more I thought of:<br/>\nNormal Mafia - character dies, player is out of game. <br/>\nConverted - character is converted, player becomes member of other team.<br/>\nDisenfranchised - character has their vote eliminated, but can still participate otherwise. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of the last, thematically, is an exposed ninja no longer can vote... the Ronin know who he is! But ninja are stealthy, so they run away, and still get to stalk at night with the other ninjas, and use their power. If there are no longer any hidden ninjas (they've all been exposed), then they cannot assasinate anyone, and the Ronin win. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny problems with that?

Each role which acts in secret must be awakened in the night and silently queried. In practice, this can take a minute or two for each role set (ex: all wolves rise, each seer, each protector). Meanwhile, the sleeping town gets restless--tired of tapping or rocking or thigh-slapping--after about three minutes, I find.<br/><br/>So you're gonna have LONG nights or a LOT of outed roles... and an outed role is soon to be a dead role, if their ability is in any way a threat or hindrance to any faction.<br/><br/>Also keep in mind that this game requires all of the group to be present during night and day; hence the reason I said above that running it for more than thirty players is going to be unwieldy (to say the least). Also, keep both scaling (less players) and crowding (actually getting a group together) in mind, for both testing and for general play upon release. It is very, very hard for most folks to get even a 15-person AYAW game going; I'd suspect a 50- to 100-person game would only occur at the largest of conventions or geekiest of big house parties.<br/><br/>It almost sounds like you're thinking of more of a walking-talking, multi-area LARP game, which just happens to have static role cards and segmented time/rounds. Or, at the least, you are sidling up to that game form, as you shift away from "pure" Mafia. Not a good or bad thing, but you might find the end result no longer has much in common with mafia: the immediacy, the speed of play, the freedom to role-play (i.e. inventing a "persona" for your petty Villager; not functional roles), learning to read other participants (i.e. needing to see them in several games and most/all of roles, to get a feel for how they lie).<br/><br/>I'm not igging it... just pointing out that it's a particular breed of game, suited to some expansion and variation, but fragile nonetheless.<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132999/#Comment_132999" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T14:16:43+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  2:16PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 2:18PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I AM, in fact, thinking of something more LARPy. This is Story Games, after all... I'm interested in the game less for the competition than to see what evolves from play. Hence one of my desires for complexity. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it will take longer to play. No, I don't imagine that you'd ever use all of the cards. Or very rarely. <br/>\n<br/>\nEver play Cosmic Encounters? It's a game that claims to have a ton of replayability based solely on the fact that you play up to six of dozens of roles each game. The combinations of positions that can actually occur in play is staggering. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I'm aiming for. A game that's different each time due to the fact that the roles that are employed change each time. This is also why they have to be pretty well balanced in terms of power. You want the sides to balance out on size, largely, and not have to worry about if the cards will manage to provide it. They should merely alter the flow of play, and the strategies that are employed based on the discovery of which roles are in play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI expect it to work as well with 8 as 48. If I design it right. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure how well it's going to work. But that's what I'm going to try. Sorry, David, I'm really not one much for pure immitation... I always tinker with designs. Just putting a new "skin" on the game doesn't thrill me. Too easy. Already been done. <br/>\n<br/>\nTell you what... maybe I will do an easy project. And then a more difficult one. Solve everyone's needs. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any limitation on printing of which I should be aware? Some cost breakpoint on a set that I should shoot for?

I designed it (and played it) for a Halloween party originally. We had about 45 players the first time out, IIRC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133210/#Comment_133210" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T08:43:36+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  8:43AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, I did read yours. And, yeah, it's sorta the pace I'm going for, sure. But.. I'm not looking to make a light "while you party" game (Like the Murder Mystery series). But rather something more intense... you get together to play this game. And, of course, your game is very elegant, while mine will be ugly complicated, what with all of the roles. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, you really should publish Last man Standing through David. Wouldn't compete with my game one bit (on the contrary, they'd probably compliment each othe's sales). Very different concepts in some ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd pay five bucks for it. Maybe even eight. Depending on the production values. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5812/werewolves-of-millers-something-man-awesome-game" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5812/werewolves-of-millers-something-man-awesome-game" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5812/werewolves-of-millers-something-man-awesome-game/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5812%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5812%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
