It's an application of the rules and principles of Apocalypse World (Successfully I hope) into a cRPG form. The scenario can be download <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/956325/Stimmer%20Bar.cmp" rel="nofollow">here </a>and requires <a href="http://www.chatmapper.com/download-now/" rel="nofollow">Chatmapper </a>to run. This little vignette is loosely drawn from a game I'm currently writing that takes place in post-apocalyptic Columbian Plateau. The final game will hopefully be less violent, but I figured this scenario would be better suited for a short stint like this.<br/><br/>Feel free to let me know about your thoughts of adapting AW to a cRPG form and any bugs or criticism you might have of my vignette (I'm pretty drunk right now so there will doubtlessly be a few bugs and typos)!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
