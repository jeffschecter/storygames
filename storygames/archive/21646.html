It would probably work great if you wanted to have most of the main setting of your <i>Beyond the Wall and Other Tales</i> village in miniatures.<br/><br/>[They also have a few boats in similar scale]<br/><br/>Anyhow, thought I'd share. I've often thought that terrain building/buying is more of a hassle than minis buying/building, so knowing this stuff exists at this price and ease of build is kinda great.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
