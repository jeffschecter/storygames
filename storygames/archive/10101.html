That I don't have it yet is just to point out that maybe I'm misinterpreting things a bit, but I'm looking at applying the idea of looking at a fantasy shock rather than one introduced by technology.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm thinking of a game setting. It's medieval Europe around the time of the black death. Only this time the black death has an additional effect - it reanimates people as zombies. It's nothing on a world war z scale, the zombies can be hacked to death by normal means, it doesn't have to be a head shot, and everyone was staying ahead of things pretty well by burning bodies after they die. Some people even got zealous and started burning them before they die, which has lead to people infected going into hiding - until they die and reanimate and start attacking. This has resulted in a series of micro outbreaks that's killing more of the population than the black death did.<br/><br/>Several other things have happened in concert. Witches are real and have magic powers, they're the only ones who can cure a zombie infection straight out, and some have gotten active in fighting them. Witches are almost all female, there might be some odd male witches in a village in Gaul that are descended from Getafix, but this has brought women into the spotlight as movers and shakers. The church is useless against the zombies, all their prayers are for naught. This has created a power shake up as Christianity has lost a serious amount of followers - some are staying faithful looking at it as a test of faith, but they're really not getting anything in return, they're sticking around because it's only been a span of a few years by now. A lot of people are going back to following pagan ways, and women, as witches, are the focal point.<br/><br/>The zombie outbreaks have also shaken other monsters out of hiding, getting them to be more active. Some see it as an opportunity to attack, with such population devastation things are looking good, others are getting attacked by zombies and they're fighting back. Also, some communities had 'peaceful' ways of dealing with them, perhaps involving sacrifice, perhaps other means, and the fact that the zombies are being dealt with by fighting them has gotten them the idea to have these monsters solved by fighting them as well. <br/><br/>The nature of zombie infection makes it very difficult to fight them on a large scale with full armies, because they can totally devastate a large force with an infection. So smaller parties are the solution, and adventurers either hole up somewhere and defend it or go from place to place fighting zombies and other menaces. This is the PCs.<br/><br/>So I've got some questions. Given the accepted premises - zombie black death, witches have real magic and the church is useless, and there are other monsters - how many of these assumptions are good or how many of them might work better a bit differently? What was life like around the time right before? Also, I've seen it mentioned that the population reduction of the black death allowed a step out of feudalism. Not sure exactly how that worked, but it sounds interesting so if anyone gets that, an explanation on how that would shake things up a bit differently with zombies, monsters and witches would be cool. Would Europe no longer be a theocracy and become a democracy? Would it shift to a matriarchal theocracy? Would things happen differently in different countries for different reasons? Is there anything else of interest to discuss that relates to this whole idea even loosely?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224199/#Comment_224199" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T06:13:30+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  6:13AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a passing interest in Shock:, but this definitely piques it.

Let's make some shit up.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Getafix</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>HA!</p>\n<p>OK, a thing about Shock: is that adding too many Shocks can make the game all mushy unless you're very careful. I'd suggest that you follow the rules for adding Shocks between sessions.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Also, I've seen it mentioned that the population reduction of the black death allowed a step out of feudalism.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Find out in play! Work it out with all players involved.</p>\n<p>If it were me and my group, we'd probably set the Issues as "Individual freedom", "religious oppression", and "democide". Then have Protagonists who are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the sole remaining blacksmith who can call the shots with his lord</li>\n<li>a witch who holds the cure for her village but is unable to act in the open due to a forceful bishop</li>\n<li>a kobold whose people have been run out of chimneys and into hiding over the last thousand years and have a chance for some payback.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Personally, I'm not overly interested in zombies. By definition, they don't have wills of their own. However, the walking dead are obviously the Shock here, and I like that their presence has really human consequences.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
