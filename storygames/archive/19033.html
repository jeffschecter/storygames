All grad students, so numerous references to critical theory and philosophy. It was great!<br/><br/>Humanity encounters a race of fungaloid aliens who reproduce by merging with other species. There is peace and prosperity for a time as humanity expands into the stars with help from their new symbiotic allies, but problems with spore-enhanced agriculture lead to mass starvation and war. Eventually, the human species as we know it is extinct, living on in an evolved, hybrid fungaloid form... but is it sustainable?<br/><br/>Standout scene: a talk show featuring the first human-fungaloid union, speaking as one and introducing humanity to both the beauty and the horror of total entanglement with another entity. It was incredible the way the game allowed us to avoid ever fixing the aliens as Bad Guys or Good Guys - just agents in the process of history.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425501/#Comment_425501" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T21:35:57+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  9:35PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2013 9:36PM by Felan.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel, one-on-one play-by-post.
