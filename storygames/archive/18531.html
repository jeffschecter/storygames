It's a completely ordinary traditional fantasy adventure game, albeit one crafted to a higher standard than the vast majority of '90s games. The GMing tasks were basically handled by having decisions made by whoever at the table felt like it.<br/><br/>Obviously the results of such a free-wheeling test depend mostly on the players, their relations, and their agenda, but in our case it worked just fine. A good example of how a rpg sometimes works with very little in the way of system (take the GM out of a trad game, you just removed 85% of the game's system, such as it is), as long as the players are on the same wave-length aesthetically. We got situations, color, some combat encounters and so on, with no discernible difference against a GM who just happened to be pretty explicit about showing the players his paperwork. I frankly preferred it to the ordinary organization of playing Praedor, and would go for it again - it's a pretty character-centered game, and allowing everybody to take care of the GMing duties while they play characters is just less boring, well-crafted as the game is.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416867/#Comment_416867" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T07:49:23+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  7:49AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416868/#Comment_416868" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T07:50:48+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  7:50AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2013 7:53AM by kobutsu.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, OK, what is the GM position to you?

Once I posted this question, I realized that I had the answers in several games on my shelf/hard drive, games which I've never sat down to play. For example, I own Dog Eat Dog, Fiasco, Ribbon Drive, Microscope, The Quiet Year, etc. That makes me sad. Well, maybe not so sad for missing out on D&amp;D 4th ed., but I really need to get playing. Maybe once I finish GM-ing Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>Lumpley: I like your idea, but that's going outside the rules for most games. I was looking for how games explicitly handled the GM-less situation. I'm not going to argue against laziness, though. While there are a few genres that work better with a GM (e.g. mystery), that doesn't mean that the motivation (or lack thereof) behind GM-ing doesn't influence the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416877/#Comment_416877" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T09:35:12+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  9:35AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are asking about how authority is distributed in play, and looking for games where that authority is distributed completely equally at all times, sounds like.

Concentrating on the latter, there are a number of things that require one or more of the players to make decisions, and the apportioning of these roles is very interesting. I'm thinking of things like the framing and, perhaps more importantly, the ending of scenes; the adding in of game-altering elements in the shape of turning over plot/event cards; who is going to have responsibility for locating in-game events withing the metafiction, and who is going to have more power in terms of the metafiction (I'm thinking particularly here of The Occupation in Dog Eat Dog, a game perhaps even more GMless than Fiasco) etc. <br/><br/>Also, who is going to have the ability to say 'This will happen in the game', or 'X will happen to Y's character'/'X cannot happen to Y's character', like in Microscope where the rules explicitly say that it's <i>not </i>a co-operative game, and that if a player says something happens in a scene, it happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416902/#Comment_416902" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T12:50:14+00:00" title="June 23, 2013 12:50PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A solid 80-90 percent of what most people don't want to do about GM-ing is real world organization and teaching, not in-game creation and authority.

Or at least not without considerable heartache, and the growing feeling that pulling teeth would be a lot easier. At my local club the standard fare is WoD, D&amp;D Xe and Pathfinder etc., and, in those types of games, i.e. games where [your choice of words] the GM [your choice of words] the game environment, the way responsibility and accountability are assigned is by someone putting up a game on the forum, getting sign-ups for it and then players and GM turning up at the appointed time and running/playing the game. <br/><br/>Seriously, I really do hear what you're saying, and I agree with you, but the above is simply the reality for most people here in the UK, and, I would hazard, in most other countries too. We on Story Games exist in something of a bubble; yes, it would be fantastic to change people's attitudes, but as I say you end up feeling as if your head has gone ten rounds with a brick wall. There's one arena where radical new-think is both possible and indeed is happening, and that's the London Indie RPG meet-up group- which was set up partly in response to the kinds of old-think you're inveighing against- but that's about it I'm afraid.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416907/#Comment_416907" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T13:40:14+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  1:40PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2013 1:45PM by MatrixGamer.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fairy Tale Assassin League is GMless. The player who brings the game is the game host and plays the single bad guy player but their only job as a host is to help keep the game moving rather than to direct play.<br/><br/>Players create the scenario by saying how the bad guy screwed the over. The bad guy brags about how evil they are and everyone knows that in the last turn of the game the good guys get medieval on the bad guy. Aside from that the players have totally equal power. <br/><br/>The active player plays an action card or points to the next scene can and makes up a story. Other players play actions cards to challenge and add to the story or alter it. High roller wins. Winners get to keep the action cards (which give victory points). Almost everything that is said happens and the cards guide play towards cool stuff. All the players, including the host are equal. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Plays in an hour. No prep. Sets up and tears down in minutes.<br/><br/>As to the philosophical questions of what a Game Master is? If a game is a conversation between players (and one player runs the whole world - aside from the PCs) The there is one player who does a whole lot more than the others. All players have the power to make shit up but this one player has more scope to make stuff up in. This is true even in the world games. If the world GM is following the rules they are not making anything up to power trip on the other players but that doesn't deny that they have a hell of a lot more power which can make or break a game.<br/><br/>If a game does not need one strong player to take on this bigger role then it is GMless. That is not true of many RPGs. D+D can be played using random encounter tables and with a few tweaks a room generation table or two but it would be a mere shadow of what D+D can be. Kind of like computer games that do just that. It's just not the same beast as conversations go. <br/><br/>Which brings us to the rub. GMfull games often need to be seen for players to know how to play them. They can't easily be run from just reading about them. I think this also applies to Fiasco. Sorry Jason but if I'd just read the rules and not played before I'd have had a hard time figuring out all the rules (one key dice rolling rule was only in a section header and not in the following text). I remember the same confusion in reading My Life With Master. I couldn't figure it out without seeing it. This is not the case with board games, card games etc.<br/><br/>Been grappling with this issue for years. Writing rules is easy. Writing coherent rules is hard. Writing rules that elegantly explain exactly how to play is extremely hard and that is what a GMless game requires IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416908/#Comment_416908" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T13:47:41+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  1:47PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2013 1:51PM by lumpley.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>catty_big:</b> Huh?

Games like Fiasco are GM-ful, basically a table full of GMs, but even there authority ebbs and flows. </blockquote>\n(1) How would you change that sentence to eliminate the concept of authority?

GMfull games often need to be seen for players to know how to play them. They can't easily be run from just reading about them. I think this also applies to Fiasco. Sorry Jason but if I'd just read the rules and not played before I'd have had a hard time figuring out all the rules (one key dice rolling rule was only in a section header and not in the following text). I remember the same confusion in reading My Life With Master. I couldn't figure it out without seeing it.

The new model says it's up to <i>all </i>the players (perhaps we should instead call them participants), including the person who reads out the rules, to 'make things happen'. Those things that are happening (or not, depending on how good or bad the game session is) include one of the participants looking up random encounter tables and saying at various junctures 'Oh hey there's a monster' and the other participants bringing the awesome via their interaction with both the gameworld and the other participants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416915/#Comment_416915" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T15:07:48+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  3:07PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2013 5:36PM by Rickard.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The new model says it's up to <i>all </i>the players (perhaps we should instead call them participants), including the person who reads out the rules, to 'make things happen'.</blockquote>\nI think you got some sane ideas. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But I want to inflict one little trouble with collaborate storytelling. In games with one authority figure, the game will stand or crash with that person. In collaborate storytelling games, it's up to the whole group, which means that the whole group must be on the same level. This is one reason to why, in my experience, collaborate storytelling tend to crash more often. I don't think this depends on the playstyle per se, but because these kinds of games doesn't give time to form positive and solid relations within the group. A relation that forms the group so they can get on the same level; so everybody knows what to do.<br/><br/>Another aspect to consider is that the group have a limited creative space, and the same ideas can reoccur again and again in a group, or escalate up to the brink where it turns surreal. Again, I don't think this is because of the playstyle but because the game itself doesn't bring enough to the table so that the group can interpret and get inspired in several kinds of ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416920/#Comment_416920" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T16:39:44+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  4:39PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And <a href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">@Jason_Morningstar</a>, I don't want to put you on the spot, but why do call Fiasco a GMful game?</blockquote>Not to answer for Jason, but obviously we've talked about this a lot. <i>Fiasco</i> is GM-full because much of the fun of being a GM\u2014making up setting, controlling the pace of the story, playing NPCs, etc. \u2014is distributed equally among the players.

In some games, players have different mechanical roles. In other games, they don't. In either case, someone helpful and friendly will be able to guide you through the learning curve.<br/><br/>GMless is a term that's only important for folks who assume that games by default have a GM. And for those people the most useful term is going to be GMless. But since games don't have GMs by default, coming up with a special term seems like an exercise in unnecessary branding.<br/><br/>You could just say, "This is Polaris. It's about chivalrous knights who fall victim to folly in a beautiful, icy city slowly being devoured by demons and demonic influence. It's a tragedy. We trade off on roles: protagonists, supporting characters, antagonists. Ritual phrases are used to guide negotiations. Those ritual phrases are critical to play." I don't think that description is benefited in any way by a new phrase like <i>roundtable game</i> or <i>decentralized game</i> or <i>dispersed authority game</i> or <i>equal-agency game</i> or <i>circle game</i>.<br/><br/><br/>Further, few games-without-GMs follow a similar structure. Some have protagonist/antagonist dichotomies. Some have areas of expertise/authority. Some have heavily-procedural rules. Some are structured freeform. They're all grouped together because of an absence, not because of any similarity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416957/#Comment_416957" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T07:16:11+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  7:16AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very good point coming out here, that the term "GMless game" is really only an explanation for players used to the idea of one person running the show, because that's so ingrained in tabletop tradition.

Maybe we're at a pivotal moment in the history of roleplaying: if we're all feeling brave enough, maybe we can all stop saying things like GM, GMful and GMless etc., and just say, for each game, both in the rulebook and when pitching it, 'Responsibility for x, y and z parts of this game are apportioned thus'. Yeah, I hear ya, but I can dream can't I?   <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416971/#Comment_416971" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T08:30:27+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  8:30AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>catty_big:</b> I am totally with you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416980/#Comment_416980" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T11:20:51+00:00" title="June 24, 2013 11:20AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that is the exact moment that we're at.

There are games that are super cooperative in that sense, where you're collaboratively creating a story together in a very loose fashion.

I was the regular GM and their lack of wanting to GM meant I pretty much could run what I wanted.  So I started running seasons of games where each game after the last would have more and more shared responsibility.  It came to a climax when I ran In A Wicked Age with a pre-selected oracle that only had enough implied characters for the players and none for me.  I was a facilitator only and helped people frame scenes and moderated the rules, but I controlled no characters and was not the source of the content of the conflict.<br/><br/>The end result was the same as when I ran traditional games where I had all the responsibility except for what each of the PC's attempted to do or say.  Those who were inclined to passivity continued to sit back and watch, participating to the point they felt they wanted to and those who enjoyed the responsibility for creative input stepped up and contributed.<br/><br/>Everyone said they had been enjoying the games more and more, but I believe the half of the group who wanted to be entertained by those who accepted the responsibility I was offering were pleased simply because there were now <i>more people entertaining them.</i><br/><br/>I have since learned not to try to pull teeth anymore and I don't try to get people to step up and do their part.  Myself and those who wanted the responsibility simply found others of our ilk.  I don't know if the seat warmers ever found a new GM to entertain them or not.\n<blockquote>Mythic GM Emulator.<br/><br/>Go get it.

Historically, more than a few games gave their GM's cutesy names while being functionally identical, which invited a "find the GM!" backlash in the way many people read games. If a designer is trying to make their game palatable to existing gamers it can be tough to have a kinda-sorta-GM-ish role in a game and not call it a GM, since that can invite a silly, distracting argument into discussion about the game. (Also, it can be tough to have any kind of player asymmetry without setting off people's alarm bells.) It would be nice if it was easier to engage with each game on its own terms, but comparing and contrasting to other established games is also somewhat inevitable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416983/#Comment_416983" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T12:20:02+00:00" title="June 24, 2013 12:20PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>also quick moment to recognize: if we're at a place in our hobby where we can have games with new configurations of authority and player roles, and we don't need to label them as weird exceptions, it's because of the pioneering work of GMless games that have come before. big shout-out to Polaris, Shock:, Universalis, Capes, Jason Morningstar's games, and others.<br/><br/>they were GMless games, and that was weird. and they helped us shift the hobby to a place where we can abandon the GMless label, maybe.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416985/#Comment_416985" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T12:27:47+00:00" title="June 24, 2013 12:27PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll note I don't use the term "GMless" anywhere in any of my games.<br/><br/>Polaris doesn't even use the term "roleplaying game."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417010/#Comment_417010" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T16:20:33+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  4:20PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2013 4:21PM by komradebob.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My only critique is that the art in the PDF was a bit overloaded with sketches of scantily clad females for no reason I could discern from the text.</blockquote>\nMy guess is there was a friend handy who was willing to provide cheap or free art for the project and they took whatever they could get.

Categories are fuzzy, nebulous things, just like labels like roleplaying games. I could just as easily decide Polaris was a "storytelling method." We use the terms GMless and roleplaying games because we're familiar with those terms, and they're useful to us. They reflect a shared experience. We do not assume their universality.<br/><br/>Vincent pointed out something that supports GM-ed play: laziness. It is (usually) more work to be a GM than to be a player. But why don't we turn that into a good thing? Rather than emphasize everybody pitching in and doing extra work, emphasize laziness. Put extra emphasis on the GM role, give responsibility to that one person who wants to put in the extra effort.<br/><br/>This is not meant to be a rhetorical question. There are many answers to it.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "GM" and "GMless" are perfectly fine terms for folks who aren't inclined to sweat the precise details.  I'd expect they'll continue to be used forever.  I pretty much <i>have</i> to use them to communicate with certain friends.<br/><br/>For deconstruction or design, on the other hand, I agree with the comments above: "What are the things that must be done in play, and who's responsible for each of them?" is more useful.<br/><br/>As for <a href="/forums/profile/madunkieg%27s">@madunkieg's</a> initial question, I've played a lot of "GMless" games which feel like taking turns GMing, but I've also played <i>Sign in Stranger</i>, which never feels like GMing to me.  There are two reasons for this:<br/><br/>1) No one ever performs the traditional GM task of inventing the environment based purely on what they think should/would be there.  Instead, someone asks a question about the environment, and someone else draws a random word to use for an answer.  In D&amp;D terms, it'd be like the Wandering Monster roll, except used for, y'know, <i>everything</i>.  <br/><br/>As far as division of labor, in <i>Sign in Stranger</i>, the draw is made by the player whose character is most expert in the question topic.  The Geographer's player draws to answer questions about terrain, the Linguist's player draws to answer questions about alien signs and symbols, etc.<br/><br/>2) No one ever performs the traditional GM task of taking a mechanical outcome ("you open the vault!") and determining how that impact what the group cares about in the fiction ("does the vault contain the treasure it was supposed to contain?").  Instead, the roll result tells you how much you learn from your investigation, how useful it will be to you going forward, and whether you get hurt or stressed or mutated in the process.  That covers pretty much everything of interest in the game's situations, other than what the characters choose to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417013/#Comment_417013" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T16:28:57+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  4:28PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, you've been ahead of us for years.

We use the terms GMless and roleplaying games because we're familiar with those terms, and they're useful to us. They reflect a shared experience. We do not assume their universality.</blockquote>\nTotally!<br/><br/>But reflecting on the games I play - I don't think to talk about Silver &amp; White or Dog Eat Dog or Durance as "GMless." Given the spread of games I'm excited about, and the people I'm pitching games to, that label has ceased to be useful in <i>my</i> thought and speech. And I've got no personal attachment to it, no reason to help it pay mortgage on any of my mental real estate.<br/><br/>I'm guessing some additional folks are in the same camp: it's ceasing to be a word with any use or importance. I bet as games branch out in all their many ways, this will become more and more true.<br/><br/>*shrugs* and that's cool to me, and also just my hunch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417016/#Comment_417016" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T16:34:08+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  4:34PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It is (usually) more work to be a GM than to be a player.

I miss writing a plot and running players through it.  Some players do in fact want to be railroaded, and will greatly enjoy it as long as it's honest and they get <i>some</i> sort of meaningful input.

It is the Dungeon Master of now.</blockquote>\nAh. When us info science/taxonomist nerds see this, we see this as a sign that you need to unpack your terms. <i>(As a "fun" exercise, try to define the terms "information," "knowledge," and "data" without creating a circular reference. I mention this both as and exemplar of the problem and because, in this group, someone will try and then an awesome game will fall out.)</i><br/><br/>So I think the confusion lies in what <a href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">@Ben_Lehman</a> started to point out: the term "GM" is actually a collection of roles and responsibilities that tends to vary depending on the context. So maybe it's a worthy exercise to figure out what these roles and responsibilities are. Here's a (necessarily incomplete) list (with some probably bad terminology) that we can start with. I think a GM in the traditional sense encompasses one or more of these things:<br/><br/><i>(If this seems like a new-thread thing, let me know.)</i><br/><br/><b>Arbiter</b> - decides when the narrative pauses and a rule needs to be invoked and makes calls<br/><b>Antagonist</b> - opposes a players actions, interests, or progress for the sake of furthering the story or giving them a challenge<br/><b>Storyteller</b> - moves the plot of the story foward<br/><b>Facilitator</b> - explains (and enforces?) the rules of the game<br/><b>Gatekeeper</b> - retains secret knowledge to be divulged at certain points or, perhaps, explicitly never to be divulged (e.g. the names of the moves in Apocalypse World)<br/><b>Worldbuilder</b> - describes the world that the story takes place in<br/><br/>I'm optionally considering including these:<br/><b>Delegator</b> - assigns roles to others in the group, either temporarily or for the duration of the game (e.g. it's possibly to GM Lady Blackbird by flipping all questions back on the asker and making them answer it)<br/><b>Tonesetter</b> - sets the mood for the story via description, names, gestures, etc.<br/><br/>Please feel free to edit/add.<br/><br/>Edit:<blockquote>Even D&amp;D 4e has a GM, the game designer</blockquote>\nInterestingly, some of these roles may be shared or owned by people not sitting at the table...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417052/#Comment_417052" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T20:57:30+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  8:57PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             Designer - In many games (GURPS, for example), you have to do things like pick skill lists and work out how the mechanics will relate to your particular game world.<br/><br/>Enforcer - Fucking someone has to kick out that asshole who is being a jerk, and the rest of you are too fucking wimpy/polite/got made fun of in school so you think you have to be everyone's friend so it's ME AGAIN, good thing I have no feelings whatsoever                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417060/#Comment_417060" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T23:07:10+00:00" title="June 24, 2013 11:07PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>it's ceasing to be a word with any use or importance.

But it was also a side-effect of my experience as GM. <br/><br/>Since the players generally didn't read rules, there was often no real reason for me to read rules either. <br/><br/>Outside of a few core mechanics, a simple "die throw, high is good, low is bad, interpret based on circumstances" worked the vast majority of times for questions that came up in play. It worked well enough that I could get away with using that exclusively when I didn't have a rule-set handy and people wanted to play something (especially if it was a one-off or a setting without an easy, obvious go-to system already available).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417124/#Comment_417124" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T09:26:06+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  9:26AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that feeling komradebob...<br/><br/>By the way, is it just me or Zelbinian's list has the potential of turning any traditional game into one with shared responsability/authority?

You could actually spread some of those roles out and still have a GMed game, especially if you spread out things having to do with judgment calls on rules or social level organizational stuff. You could further spread out some of the fictional level stuff ( as Archipelago does with players having authority over certain setting elements).<br/><br/>Heck, JDCorley hit on the first step upthread: just cutting out some of the social level stuff that has glommed onto the GM position (like Bouncer) is a pretty good first start to introducing folks used to GMed games to  more distributed styles of authority.<br/><br/>RPGs are pretty notable for the presence of a GM, compared to most other kinds of games. Most games, even ones with referees, don't have anything much close to a GM.<br/><br/>[Except the kids' game <i>Mother, May I?</i> of course, and that doesn't have much to do with fiction]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417141/#Comment_417141" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-25T13:02:20+00:00" title="June 25, 2013  1:02PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2013 1:02PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For anybody keeping score: I don't think that laziness is any part of it.

Another is being arbiter for the rules, like with the Mythic Game Master Emulator (MGME).<br/><br/>As many people have pointed out, the role of GM can't be boiled down to just one thing.

The end result is the same though.  Players that are not interested in the behaviors that constitute <i>actual play</i> in a game that spreads around responsibility rather than putting it all in the hands of one person.  There's nothing moral about it.  At worst, there can be a mismatch of expectations and some at the table are not meeting the expectations of others-- whether that is in terms of asking people to do more than they are willing or people doing less than the others at the table expect or the rules ask of them.<br/><br/>I don't think there's anything unfair about describing someone who wants all the content to be generated by other people at the table (though they occasionally will react to it) as being <i>passive </i>though.  It's certainly not active.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417206/#Comment_417206" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T09:50:47+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  9:50AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Which is related with the cohesion of the Creative Agenda.
