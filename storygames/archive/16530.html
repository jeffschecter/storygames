Other questions pretty much answered themselves as the game played, making it very suitable for solo play, if lacking the fertile imaginations you get with multiple players.<br/><br/>A few comments and questions:<br/><br/>I assume that the scope of a Complication is determined on a common-sense basis. In my game I assigned them to a Threat (so any attack on the Threat picked up the dice), a character (so anything the character did got the dice) or an arbitrary area (so, in my game, only actions taken outside the Mansion were affected by The Storm). I also moved a complication that one character had onto a Threat when that character was taken out by the Threat.<br/><br/>I assumed that if a Complication took less than three hits they were ignored and didn't accumulate as bonus dice like they do on a Threat.<br/><br/>I also assumed that all Complications ceased to exist once all Threats were eliminated, although they could provide extra difficulty or colour for a following scene. <br/><br/>On to Abilities. Can a character attempt an action with an Ability in which they have a score of zero? I assumed that they could - it's still worth doing to get the damage bonus for a weakness off any other dice you roll.<br/><br/>Finally I used a protected threat - one you could only attack once one or more other threats were eliminated. I didn't seem to be a game-breaker. The miniature gamer in me can almost see a points system for Threats developing, with Threats with countdowns or that are protected costing more than basic threats                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378804/#Comment_378804" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-17T14:21:06+00:00" title="May 17, 2012  2:21PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the playtest, Alan!<br/><br/>Your assumptions are all correct. One of the goals of Danger Patrol is to make a system that is very easy to adjudicate on the fly. If something makes sense in the moment, go with it, and the game should roll along just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379881/#Comment_379881" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T20:00:30+00:00" title="May 27, 2012  8:00PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great AP Alan! Ooooh, makes me a little more enthusiatic about trying the Mythic emulator or even the Magic 8 ball for other solo storygames. Sounds like you had a blast <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
