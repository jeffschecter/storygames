My original stance was that the various subcultures outside of gaming were of no interest to me, hence my post where I basically said that their effect on my game design is to have no effect on my game design. As I said when I finished out my last post, there are glimmerings of value throughout this thread, and I want to see those fleshed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want cultural diversity in my game settings, though I don't much care about diversity along racial lines. When I first started on Mage Blade (the only of my games with an explicit setting) I went the typical fantasy route, and had elves dwarves and such to fill that gap. Since then, I've not gotten rid of the fantasy races, but I've scaled them back. Instead of having 3 nations of elves, 3 nations of dwarves and 3 nations of men, I have 1 nation of elves (from a specific origin) two nations of dwarves, and 6 nations of men. I don't want all those nations of men to be 'white fantasy' nations, not that I've ever thought about it in those terms. It just seems that there needs to be something.. distinct about them. I also don't want them to be thinly veiled cognates to real world cultures.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, thinking about that setting in light of recent conversations, the orc nation (not previously mentioned because it didn't feel immediately applicable) is/was a clumsy, unconscious attempt at racial issues. The orcs were a savage race, enslaved by humans over time as a means of attempting to control their depredations. Eventually, there was a slave revolt that sparked off a war, which eventually ended with the nations being called to the negotiation tables, and the orcs being given their own nation in reparation for generations of treatment that was against the codes of the over-arching society. Orcs weren't considered part of that society, therefore outside its protection, until the agreements. Obviously, this solution had some enemies. The orcs had, by and large, been slaves to the humans for so long that they had little cultural identity of their own, and suddenly, they were running their own nation. Some of the humans still felt the orcs deserved slavery or death. Others who might have been more sympathetic were angry when their lands were reduced to make a place for the orcish nation. Some of the orcs chose to join their savage brethren who hadn't been captured or enslaved, but mostly they knew they didn't belong there anymore. They were too civilized for the tribes, and too primitive for their supposed peer nations, most of whom were hostile toward them, or at best neutral. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe canon setting begins 5 years after the formation of the orcish nation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there obvious parallels to black slavery in America? Definitely. Are there also some major differences? Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the human cultures, there are divisions along the lines of how a nation 'officially' feels about the orcish nation, but they are also culturally different. The people of Arien are industrious, quiet and little given to decoration, finding expression in the minute differences in utilitarian craft styles. Their music is wordless, but rich with emotion. In the island nation of Crysse, there is a deep reverence for ocean and sky, and it's almost required that one serve in a sea-related field at some point in their life. Their art usually reflects this strong relationship with the sea, and they have a marked preference for blues, greens, greys and browns in their clothing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm rambling. Basically, I'm trying to get varied cultures without being racial about it. Are there (human) people of different skintones? Yeah, almost certainly. I figure they're scattered throughout the nations, an artifact of the globe-spanning civilization that died 500 years ago. They've had 5 centuries of a civilization that has pulled itself out of the ashes of the old. I don't figure anyone much cares what color your skin is, so much as they'd care what nation you call home, or if you're a member of one of the non-human races.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209023/#Comment_209023" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T17:37:37+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  5:37PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2009 6:12PM by madunkieg.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>I would like to know the reasons (hows and whys) behind the designing of cultures into a game?</blockquote>\nTo quote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8zWH3T5RCA" rel="nofollow">Wade Davis</a> of National Geographic, "These myriad voices are not failed attempts at being you, failed attempts at being modern, they're unique facets of the human imagination.

I'm pretty sure I was thinking about the early days following the civil war, but obviously I decided to go a different direction with it. The whole idea of making them their own country was sort of riffing off the post WWI restructuring of the Middle East, though. There's a problem people that maybe have been wronged by participants in the recent war, so the easiest way to try to solve it all is to move a few borders. Only, it doesn't solve it at all, instead creating other problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't think about all of this quite so much when I first started coming up with the setting. That was almost 10 years ago, and I was a very different person. My corner of the world didn't include much awareness of the Middle East, and the Army culture meant more than any racial, ethnic or geographically based cultures. Hence my interest in this thread is practical, not purely academic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209166/#Comment_209166" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T17:45:12+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  5:45PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite><br/>I would like to know the reasons (hows and whys) behind the designing of cultures into [Storming the Wizard's Tower]?</blockquote>\nI don't understand the question!

It's against my better judgment because I think it's telling that very few people of color replied to any of the other threads (I'll leave what it tells up to everyone's interpretation), I've probably said this all before elsewhere, I promised myself I would refrain from talking about race on the internet, especially at Story Games, and my ego is still smarting from a thread about race and Steal Away Jordan from way back when. Call me foolish.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not a white person. I can relate to white people, though. I have friends who are white (and other cultures, races, ethnicities, whatever you want to call it here). My husband is white. White people are okay with me. Really. I like you people, even if you all look alike, have horrible speech patterns, burn in the sun, and smell funny. I hope you all get that's a joke, but get that while I am an American, my experience of mainstream white American culture might be a little different from your typical white male experience, who might possibly be you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd whatever guilt you have about being white, and liking your whiteness is really yours. And it's cool if you really love the games you play even when they're all about white people, and it's cool if you can't see yourself playing a person of color. I rarely play men, and very rarely play white men. It's not that I don't feel capable, it's just my personal preference to role play women.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to write about cultures that are underserved in the vast number of games out there. I don't think I have any special right as a person of color to write about non-white people, nor do I think I can do it better than a white person. My life experiences just steer me towards making stories about people of color. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in school, my English teachers and professors always said, "write what you know". Okay, so I don't really "know" anything about slavery first hand, but growing up with an African American History professor as a mom, in an African American family, I knew slave stories, slave narratives, black history. I grew up with black people like Fredrick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Malcolm X, Toussaint Louverture, and even the Black Panthers portrayed to me as heroes. African American culture is my culture, my norm. I have a huge interest in African and African American folk tales, and folk tales from the rest of the world, like Japan (hence, Tales of the Fisherman's Wife). It's what I know, it's what I relate most to. It's what came to mind when I asked myself, "what do you want to say?". Slaves in the Antebellum South US weren't victims to me. They were heroes, and it was my assumption that a good role playing game gives at least one player the chance to be a hero.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my two games that are out in public aren't traditional fantasy in that they aren't about elves or orcs, etc. You can put fantasy in Steal Away Jordan and still have the dominant culture of the game be that of black slaves somewhere in America between 1500-1865 and earlier. You can have hell hounds, conjurers who can actually do magic, The Devil, ghosts, other demons, talking animals, etc. All of these elements appear in African and African American folk tales.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think there's a formula or technique to incorporating diverse cultures in game design. If you live under a rock and have no contact with anyone but yourself, you might have a hard time, I suppose. If you are aware that various cultures, ethnicities, religions, etc. view each other differently,  it shouldn't be difficult. But if you write what you know, it shouldn't be difficult, and if you don't know, Google it, and put your voice into what you just learned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209772/#Comment_209772" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T03:25:20+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  3:25AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2009 3:30AM by Graham.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Julia and I joked, on Thursday, that the moment she posted to this thread, it'd be over. There was some truth to it. <br/><br/>It must, surely, give us pause for thought. In a thread about culture, only white men talk, and when a black woman posts, nobody replies. Note, too, that the only people Ara asked how they'd used culture in games were white American men: not Julia, who wrote Steal Away Jordan; not Shreyas, who wrote Mist Robed Gate; and not Anna, who wrote Thou Art But A Warrior. I'm not pointing the finger at Ara, but the bias is interesting.<br/><br/>Anyway, that point made, I'll answer the original question.<br/><br/>I agree with Julia that there's not a formula for incorporating cultures into game design.

I do incorporating cultural issues should be done with an agenda, but the agenda should be different for every game.<br/><br/>I'm currently writing a game called Bleakworlds. On each world, cultures conflict, and <i>all</i> cultures have perfectly good reasons for the nasty things they're doing to other cultures. One of the design goals was there would be no black-and-white, no obvious good-and-evil split. It was a reaction to discussions of race where solutions seem simple and the bad guys easily identified. It's never that simple. So, cultures in Bleakworlds illustrate that there are two sides to every story, and that such issues are murky and nebulous.<br/><br/>So there you go. I think there should be an agenda behind incorporating cultures in a game, but I don't think it should be the same agenda for every game.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209774/#Comment_209774" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T04:51:06+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  4:51AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I put cultures in my games if I'm interested in having the cultural aspect as either something interesting to roleplay or an aspect that I think will provide interesting conflicts. More often than not, cultural divides in my games will be along class lines rather than race lines, because I've had more experience of them, although I've had some experience of racism too.<br/><br/>So in Fourpenny Touch, all the characters are female prostitutes so the interesting divides are about gender and class. In the games I've played race, although an issue in the East End in 1880s, hasn't been raised, possibly because some other conflicts are more immediate.<br/><br/>In Koenig Hospital, there's a divide between doctors and patients and also between doctors who are directors and those that aren't. Other issues can be raised by the players as they see fit given that they design the background.<br/><br/>Tbilisi also does not provide a background but gives a list of questions to be considered when creating the game. None of race, culture or gender, nor disability or religion are mentioned explicitly but I've got this list of things people might consider:<br/>1.What kind of game are we playing (Fantasy, SF, Modern Horror etc)?<br/>2.Where does the action take place (somewhere real, somewhere generic, somewhere specific)?<br/>3.Are the characters all together or do they have independent scenes?<br/>4.Are the characters on the same side at the start? Should that emerge in play?<br/>5.How powerful are the characters? Are they kings or paupers?<br/>6.What kind of things oppose the characters (monsters, people, ideas)?<br/>7.What's important for the characters (families, money, fame)?<br/>8.If there is magic, how does it work? Are there side effects?<br/>9.Is society lawful? Or does it even exist?<br/><br/>I could perhaps also talk about the lines along which culture divides and the extent to which that is something that interests the players in addressing in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209786/#Comment_209786" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T07:12:57+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  7:12AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham: Heya.
