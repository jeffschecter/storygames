What's Dark Days? I'm glad you asked!<br/><br/>You died. For a few seconds, your heart stopped, your lungs stopped drawing breath. Your body shut down. You thought dying would be grander, more impressive somehow. But dying isn't like in the movies. Death is bloody, dirty, without dignity or pride.<br/>Getting shot, stabbed, hit by a car, thrown from a window, cutting your wrists, taking a bottle of pills, plastic bag around your head are all viable means of death. It happens to everyone, anywhere and for no reason at all other than chance and a bit of bad luck.<br/>So you died. But you came back. You came back unlike all the others that get a casket and a shovelful of earth and maybe a few flowers, if they were loved or rich enough.<br/>Your close brush with death probably affected you deeply. You felt like a zombie, a dead man walking. Maybe it has something to do with the nightmares you see every night, the horrible dreams that visit you, that won't let you rest. The times when you shut your eyes and saw a different world, bleak, fleeting. Maybe it's you have this nagging feeling that something isn't right, like a shadow you can only see with the corner of your eye. Turn around and it's gone. The dreams are getting worse and you think there's something else too.<br/>Maybe they're not dreams. Maybe they're a memory. Where did you go when you died?<br/><br/>So Dark Days is about these guys(and ladies!) called Wayward. They're part of the occult underworld of New Baltimore, investigating weird cases and phenomena. There are different types of characters, called Cabals. These are: Avengers, Hellblazers, Redeemers, Doppelgangers, Wraiths and Haunters.<br/>The relevant mechanics here are the Chapters of character creation. Taken from Fate, there are 5 chapters, each giving 1 aspect. These are: Life, Darkness, Death, Glimpse, and Crucible.<br/>Life deals with your life before it got fucked up. Darkness details how the Darkness touched your life and what effect it had. Death is how you died and Glimpse is the nightmare you had, the revelation that brought you back from the dead. The Crucible one deals with how your group met.<br/>Aspects work more or less like in Spirit of the Century and Fate in general.<br/>The characters for my playtest were:<br/><br/>1. Hellblazer<br/>Concept: Burned out artist<br/>An artist that went insane when he was betrayed as a teenager by a girl. He uses scalpels like an artist uses brushes. Using a brush he can see into the Dusk. He sketches or draws other people\u2019s darkest secrets.<br/><br/>Aspects:<br/>Creepy<br/>Institutionalized<br/>Drug Addict<br/>On the Edge<br/>Horror movie buff<br/><br/>2. Avenger<br/>Concept: Ex-cop<br/>An ex-cop whose wife was murdered by a criminal he decided to give a second chance to. His glimpse showed him that a person forced the criminal\u2019s hand.<br/><br/>Aspects:<br/>Protector<br/>Never Forgive<br/>Payback\u2019s a Bitch<br/>Enemies<br/>\u2018\u2019I know people\u2019\u2019<br/><br/>3. Doppelganger<br/>Concept: Company Executive<br/>A company executive that was murdered by the father of a kid that commited suicide. Although he wasn\u2019t responsible, he didn\u2019t do anything to stop it.<br/><br/>Aspects:<br/>Quiet Guy<br/>Athletic<br/>Honorable<br/>Think Twice<br/><br/>4. Redeemer<br/>A farm boy that discovered a satanic cult that sacrificed his sister. He went to jail as an accomplice, where he got stabbed by an inmate for refusing to deal drugs. He has an aversion to cults of all kinds and wants to help people that have become involved in one.<br/><br/>Aspects:<br/>Hates Cults<br/>Clean Cut<br/>Church Goer<br/>Schizophrenic<br/>\u2018\u2019I know them\u2019\u2019<br/><br/><br/>The sessions started with character creation. First, I described the general concept of the game and the setting, focusing on the different cabals and the Wayward in general. The cabal descriptions, boons and curses seemed to go over very well and generate excitement. Right of the bat most players had a couple possible cabal choices that they thought were really interesting. Most popular choices were Haunters, Redeemers, Wraiths and Avengers. All the cabals had fans though, which I thought was nice. One of my goals was to create cabals that were all interesting in some way.<br/><br/>The first player created an Avenger. I explained the concept of Aspects as a game trait and how character creation used the 5 chapters to describe the character\u2019s story up to this point.<br/>Most chapters were pretty straightforward and I didn\u2019t encounter any hiccups. I noticed there was some overlap, where for example the chapter Death or Darkness also described some parts that would probably belong in the Life chapter. All in all though this was to be expected, since no life is linear.<br/><br/>Coming up with aspects wasn\u2019t particularly hard once the players grasped the general concept. I gave examples from the example character created in the text and some of my own that I came up with on the spot.<br/>Players mostly accepted my proposals of aspects, though the creation was essentially a joint effort. I noticed it was important for the ST or the person with most experience to \u2018\u2019guide\u2019\u2019 the players by asking questions about their character and offering aspects.<br/>Some of the aspects chosen didn\u2019t come from the key events described in the chapter, and I\u2019m still not sure if this is a bad thing yet. It certainly made things easier. (the aspect \u2018\u2019Athletic\u2019\u2019 is one such example. It stemmed from the fact that the Doppelganger character used to play football in college).<br/>Using quotes or phrases as aspects made things a lot easier so I think I should consider using aspects in that way. A phrase usually describes better what the concept is about.<br/>Like \u2018\u2019Payback\u2019s a bitch\u2019\u2019 in the case of the Avenger is probably a phrase the character would use, to show that he believes in the concept of payback and coupled with his chapter details, it\u2019s easy to remember that the characters is vengeful. Plus, the quote is much cooler than writing down \u2018\u2019Vengeful\u2019\u2019.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188941/#Comment_188941" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T22:05:32+00:00" title="January 18, 2009 10:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We went through character creation. One of the players hadn\u2019t decided what cabal he wanted yet, so I offered to go through character creation first and then judge what kind of cabal would fit.<br/>This proved a bit hard to do, since we reached the Glimpse chapter and nothing jumped out at us, although a couple of cabals could be removed from the possible choices. Seeing as the Glimpse is narrated by the ST, the cabal would be essentially my choice, even if it wasn\u2019t on purpose. If I described a glimpse where future events were shown, he would be a Wraith, and if I showed how someone had him murdered, he would be an Avenger.<br/>Maybe this could work if the players take it upon him to narrate the Glimpse chapter. In our case we discussed cabals a bit until he chose the Doppelgangers.<br/>The rest of the characters creation went smooth for the most part.<br/><br/>When the characters reached the Crucible chapter, they had to wait until the others were also done. I hadn\u2019t figured out how this chapter works yet, so initially I decided to let the players talk about it collectively. A player had an idea where each player would narrate a part and then another would continue, linking them together and thus bringing the characters together. This proved a bit too hard so I winged it by making this chapter into an introductory scenario instead. I will post this too, a bit later though.<br/><br/>In general, I was happy with how things went. Aspects were a bit tough at first, but people ''got'' them pretty fast after the first character was done. There isn't much collaboration in the first 4 chapters, but there was still interest and suggestions by other players while we created someone's character.<br/><br/>I don't really know what kind of feedback I'm looking for, since I didn't encounter many problems in this part. I think the aspects we came up with may be a bit bland and I'd love to find a way to make chargen more like actual play, so any suggestions on that, plus general feedback would be appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188951/#Comment_188951" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T00:28:17+00:00" title="January 19, 2009 12:28AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was very surprised to read (in the actual play) that the content of the Glimpse is provided by the GM; what's the intent behind that choice? Is 'the other side' meant to be a source of coherent/connected mystery? I think if I was playing a game where the most important thing about my character was that s/he Saw Something When S/he Died, I would be startled to discover that I did not get to decide what it was s/he saw. <br/><br/>Combined with the pulpy, violent-action feel I get from the other character descriptions I suspect I simply started out with some misconceptions about the game; I kind of assumed it would involve players making statements about or otherwise exploring the 'meaning' of death. It sounds from your description that the dying is actually just a means to some other end, which is the true focus of the stories -- the Glimpse provides some specific impetus for other character action, like solving mysteries or taking revenge on murderers or the like.<br/><br/>So I guess the take-away if any is that it's not clear to me what the purpose of the Glimpse is, in both the structure of the game and the character generation process as you describe them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188953/#Comment_188953" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T01:15:28+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  1:15AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're perfectly right, I failed to give examples on the Glimpse. In large part, the Glimpse is either about something that is going to happen in the future, or an unveiling of the past. <br/><br/>To use an example, the Doppelganger character initially described in his Death chapter that he was assassinated by a hitman. He thought that this happened because he refused to look the other way when another exec in his company was embezzling money. In his Glimpse, he saw that the man responsible for his murder was in fact the father of a classmate that committed suicide while he was in college. The father was driven insane and with the help of some misinformation, thought that the Doppelganger was responsible in some way and thus had him killed.<br/><br/>For the Avenger character, who was a cop who found and killed the man who killed his wife, the Glimpse revealed that the murder wasn't an accident, like he initially thought, but that a man with ties in the occult mafia ordered the hit. <br/>To be more specific, the Avenger caught a guy stealing but let him go, thinking he'd give him another chance. But the man was then forced to track down and kill the cop's wife to prove to his boss that he wasn't a snitch. The fact that his boss already had a tarot card with the cop's address revealed that he was something else altogether...<br/><br/>The Glimpse isn't decided by the GM, we only did it this way to add some ''mystery'' in the game. If a player wants to come up with a complete story for his character, including the Glimpse, that's awesome and encouraged(this was the case with the Hellblazer character).<br/><br/>What I was trying to do in the example I mentioned, was to arrive at the character type(Cabal) in an organic fashion. If the player came up with a Glimpse where there was a revenge theme involved, he would probably turn out to be an Avenger. So what I meant is that it's hard to create a character that way. Letting a player choose his ''Cabal'' from the beginning works better.<br/><br/>I hope this clarifies things, let me know if I didn't answer any of your questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
