Right now what I've been doing is taking things from my dreams that seem important and turning them into setting. This creates something very flat that I insert the players character into. The character is unable to speak or grasp the setting to change things, so is limited to descriptive statements about what the character does.<br/><br/>Let me give a concrete example. Here's a bit and cut and paste of a post I made recently on the Forge, about the tower, doctored a little for this post:<br/><br/>---------------------------------------<br/><br/>The Tower has a landing and a set of stairs that wind around the outside of the tower. There is a line that stretches from a platform on top of the tower, going down the stairs to the ground and continues off to the horizon. Len's character is at the top of the tower with all the people behind him yelling for him to hurry up and jump so they could get on with it. Previous games have allowed Len to know that these people are waiting in line to kill themselves by leaping from the tower. This time rather than trying to stop the jumpers as he has before, he decided to try to work his way down the tower stairs getting around the people. I made him roll. He won easily so he got to the bottom with no complications.<br/><br/>At the bottom he looked for a door in the bottom of the tower, and I took his offer and made a door. He opened it and I described a staircase, but this one leads down. He followed it down and I described it leading to a cavern which again lead to a line, but this time of spirits waiting in line. He walked down through the cavern alongside the spirits. He eventually reached a place where there were monstrous guards, who questioned each spirit and then let them through. Len decided his character wanted to find someone who looked like his mommy. I obviously let him do that, as it was a bit of an offer. I told him that he would have to use some of his characters magic if he wanted to get her attention. We rolled dice. Len won. He got her attention and she started asking him where his characters mommy was, and what was he doing alone, etc. She decided to try to help him find his mommy. (He answered questions I asked by nodding or shaking his head.) She found another spirit in line and this spirit pointed to past where the guards were when asked where the kids mommy might be. The two of them walked past the line and the guards stood at attention upon seeing Len. They eventually reach a dias where there is a woman made out of Ice sitting on a throne, and half a dozen of the demon monsters directing the spirits to travel down different paths.<br/><br/>The Ice Woman stands up and says, "I thought I told you not to leave your room!" to Len's character. She gives the demons a wave and they grab the helpful spirit woman over their head and begin ripping her apart. Len immediately decided to stop them. We rolled dice. He won again. i got no successes, it doesn't pay to be evil aparently. Len Defeats the demons and then confronts the Ice woman. I forget what he was trying to do, but we rolled dice and this time I won. So I had the Ice woman turn her finger into a sharp knife, and slowly cut the spirit woman into slices. We cut this scene there. We both saw this as two aspects of his characters mommy, and the good side losing. Sad.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>So the thing I'm considering is that first scene. Basically Len was telling me he wasn't interested in engaging that scene, mainly because I've been starting with it each time to see how flexible it is, plus since all the scenes are kind of connected to my psyche or whatever, I don't have a ton of scenes. The game was kind of flat until he decided to look for something he wanted, which I then warped. What I'm wondering is if folks have techniques they've found helpful to move to something a player finds more interesting rather than just going bang, bang, until something sticks?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145259/#Comment_145259" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T06:25:05+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  6:25AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2008 6:26AM by lachek.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forgive my ignorance.

There are specific static elements, the children, and when I run the game there will be static setting elements based on dreams or creations of mine. Other folks can use them, and I'll discuss how and why you might want to create your own. Basically the game is about the process of healing from child abuse, or I think other forms of abuse, but I'm specifically addressing child sexual abuse. The game is a two person game, and I see three ways right now for the game to be played; someone like myself who has been through abuse creating the imagery that is expressive perhaps of that abuse, or maybe without knowing why the imagery is important. The tower is one of these, I didn't know it's meaning prior to Len going through it a few times. That's one way. Another way might be for someone like me to share this with someone who hasn't addressed these issues. The third might be for folks who just are interesting in playing a weird game. <br/><br/>The specific elements, the child, are always the same regardless of the exterior setting.<br/><br/>So in the game these scenes have been precreated and are likely meaningful to the gamemaster. If I do well in the writing of the game they should be prebuilt with situation. This does not mean they will be meaningful to the player. The player may not want to engage them. In normal play I'd just say,"Okay," and I would insert something else, likely a bang, or some type  of challenge, or let it just kind of roll until I got some kind of input to the player which might bring the game to a halt if the player doesn't give me an "offer." I did the last as I know Len and his playstyle, I figured he'd like find something he wanted to do, plus he's comfortable with exploration. (I don't mean exploration in theory wonk terms)<br/><br/>Am I answering your question here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Sometimes they fall flat as the player isn't interested in the decision. Therefore the best way to craft a bang in my opinion is to use the flags the player has generated through the process of making a character. If I'm not explaining this well, I'm working with the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3304&amp;page=1#Item_15" rel="nofollow">Holmesian Definition</a> of bangs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145422/#Comment_145422" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T07:13:11+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  7:13AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm... you know, those explanations have me simply wondering more things about the game. However, I suspect if I keep asking questions, I'll just end up eventually getting an entire synopsis of the game from you, and that seems like the long road.<br/><br/>So, scene framing. Dirty Secrets has the player suggest how to frame the scene, and PTA has the player provide the elements to frame the scene with (I want a scene with so and so, at such and such location, and it will be a scene of type X), which should help get scenes that the player is interested in.<br/><br/>Flags. A player indicates, verbally or through the mechanics of the game, explicitly what they are interested in. Example, Castle Falkenstein has each player write down, during character creation, three concrete, achievable goals that the character is seeking.<br/><br/>Director stance. Given the power, this is similar to the scene framing technique above, I'll create an interesting situation for myself. Example, Kickers from Sorcerer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145424/#Comment_145424" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T08:12:50+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  8:12AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2008 8:14AM by lachek.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L. Rhoer</cite>Am I answering your question here?</blockquote>\nYeah, kind of - or at least, giving me more insight into how the game works. I have more questions. I hope you'll indulge me.<br/><br/>Is the setting pre-created by the game designer (that is, you) or by each individual game master?<br/>(a better way of phrasing this - is the setting static in the book which Clyde writes, or is it statically defined during prep by the GM?)<br/><br/>Is the setting based on the game designer (Clyde's) internal state, or the GM's internal state?<br/><br/>You say the child is even more static than the external setting? Is it <i>a</i> child or a <i>specific</i> child? As in, does the book that Clyde writes contain directions for having a child in the story, or does it have directions for having a little girl named Joanna, who likes strawberries and hates snakes, in the story?<br/><br/>So far, it sounds to me as if the game is built to address issues the Game Master (or Clyde? see questions above) has. That is quite the opposite of the way most games work, which is likely why you're having some player investment issues. It appears as if your Bangs are ones which would stick with <i>Clyde</i>, and in particular Bangs which give Clyde a greater insight into his own internal state through the player's continued exploration. Does that sound right? If so, I think you're moving in a really interesting direction, and the resistance you're facing is likely due to not having figured out suitable techniques for a rather different form of game. Bangs, in their original or Holmesian form, seem like a poor fit for a game like that.<br/><br/>Let me know how that sounds and I can offer more suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Len was expressing a desire to do something else, which he told me in actual words later. <br/><br/>The setting doesn't have to be set on anyones internal state, but it can be. When I run it, it is. The book will contain my examples, my examples are like a module, you could use it to play, or create your own module. Module is in some way a good choice of words and in other ways poor. Hmm... instead of dancing around let's just do the synopsis, and then try to tackle the question afterwords? Keep hitting me with questions until you feel like you got it.<br/><br/>Silence Keeps Me A Victim is a two player game that examines child abuse and the path to healing from a somewhat safe level. The game has a Gamemaster and a player. The Gamemaster crafts various places that either have a known metaphorical content, or unknown content. For example the Tower is an example of suicide, a place that many folks who have been abused touch even if they don't cross over. It is also an example of something whose meaning I didn't understand before playing the game. I didn't know why it was important for the game. The Gamemaster will insert the player into these scenes with something immediate to address, for example, people angry with you as you slow them down on their trip to suicide as in the tower.<br/><br/>The player plays a child with a mask that prevents them from talking. The child can't effect the world around them without dice, which leaves the player with no way to express themselves except by making out of character statements. Essentially they are limited to Author stance by the games rules. Through play they will either find the strength to remove their mask and then take control of their life, or they won't find that strength and the only way to have control will be through becoming a monster and victimizing others.<br/><br/>Through play of the game, the power structure changes. The Gamemaster gradually loses power, and the player gains it which essentially causes a flip to happen which the player having all three stances and the Gamemaster being limited to Actor stance. This part just started playtesting so hasn't been achieved yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145641/#Comment_145641" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T07:14:48+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  7:14AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  Don't take this the wrong way, but its hard for me to see this tower as a Bang in the context of this game. I mean, if it were a fantasy heartbreaker, sure. But in the context of the game, wouldn't a bang almost HAVE to be a person. Either encouraging you to talk or shut up or worse...<br/>\n  Also, if you recall, Flags are elements of the character sheet of the PCs. So, was there an element of their Character sheet that called for a tower? My guess is no. I think that once you state, "I dreamed about this scene" there is a disconnect for the other players, because they have no shared frame of reference, you know?

Therefore there aren't any flags. The player of the child lacks some fundamental control over their environment. If you look at the long list of possible bangs, I linked to above, you'll see that basically a bang is something inserted into the game for the player to make some kind of decision about. The key element is that the gamemaster has no "right" idea in mind. I think the Tower qualifies. In this case it's what is the child going to do when people are trying to push them over the edge. A secondary question that I thinnk is implicit and might not be a bang is does the child take any personal responsibility knowing what the people in line are going to do afterwards. If you don't agree, it's cool, but I'm not sure what kind of forward headway we can make from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146129/#Comment_146129" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T06:33:04+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  6:33AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L.

Is that a fair summary?<br/><br/>Because, putting all that together, it sounds to me like a really hard challenge you've set for yourself.  And that's fine, I'm not saying you should change your mind about any of these restrictions.  Because if you can succeed despite all the restrictions you've set yourself, then the game you create will be unique and really interesting.<br/><br/>I'm trying to think what makes me, as a player, find scenes or situations engaging.  There are all sorts of different answers, but only a few of them are potentially relevant to Silence, as I understand it.<br/><br/>1. Something directly relevant to my character goals.  E.G. I'm playing a character who is an incorrigible womanizer, there's a pretty barmaid, let's go talk to her.<br/>2. A challenge appropriate to my character's abilities, e.g. a locked door, for a rogue.  A chance to "be useful", to help out the group, or just time to show off how cool I am!<br/>3. A problem or dilemma in my character's life -- two things he wants are opposed to each other, he can't help his family without hurting others, some very difficult choice that's going to give me a chance to get deeper into my character in order to answer, not neccessarily what would <i>I</i> do, but what would <i>this character</i> do.<br/>4. There's a statement I'm trying to make with playing this character, and the situation is an opportunity to express it.  I want to role-play my guy gradually getting corrupted by power, so I welcome chances to do so.<br/><br/>5. Something that tickles my curiosity as a player.  A puzzle, a mystery -- who could have killed the guy in the locked room?  An unknown land to explore: what's on the other side of that magic portal?<br/>6. Injustice or suffering that engages my moral sympathies.  I feel for these exploited townsfolk and want to help them out.  I see what's happening in the game world and I want to change it.<br/>7. A game goal.  I'm trying to find my way to the end of the dungeon, or solve the mystery, or whatever, so I can "win".  <br/>8. Survival.  My character is in danger of dying if I do nothing; I have to outwit or outfight my enemies and escape to somewhere safer.<br/><br/>Other people would break these down differently, I'm sure, but 1-4 are in-character motivations to engage the situation, while 5-7 are out-of-character motivations. Survival is both in and out of character, and is a strong motivation because it's very primal and immediate, but a game gets boring quickly if it's nothing but running away.<br/><br/>(Continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147497/#Comment_147497" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T00:20:45+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 12:20AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 12:22AM by Jono.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Based on what you've described, I don't think 1-3 (the in-character motivations) fit too well, because the child in the mask is kind of a nonentity, a blank of a character.  He/she doesn't have an in-character goal that I can see, which rules out #1; is seemingly helpless, which rules out #2; and doesn't have much of an identity to build a dilemma around (so no #3), or to immerse into, or to make thematic statements about (so no #4).  (Later in the game, do you discover/invent facts about the child to start to give him/her an identity?  Does the mask come off in pieces or all at once?  In-character motivations might start to become important later on after we've discovered a bit more about the child.)<br/><br/>But for the early scenes of the game, maybe you need to focus on out-of-character motivations, i.e. player-level stuff.  You've said that the child either removes the mask and becomes able to speak, or becomes a monster and victimizes others.  Those sound a lot like "winning" and "losing" to me; or at least, as a player I'd feel motivated to aim for the former outcome and try to avoid the latter.  So, what choices can I make that make one outcome more likely than the other?  Is there something I have to do in the fiction in order to make the mask come off, or something mechanical, or some combination of the two?  Conversely, what choice could I make as a player that would make it more likely that the child becomes a monster?  If you have answers for those questions, then maybe situations can be built around opportunities to have the child act in a way that gets you closer to or farther from either outcome.  A scene is engaging to me, as a player, if I can see in it opportunity for action that I think might help me make progress towards breaking the mask.<br/><br/>The exploration/curiosity aspect might also provide some out-of-character motivation to engage with the situation.  The game happens in a world built out of dream metaphors, so I'm picturing it as a surreal sort of world.  At first, I'd be drawn into exploring such a place just out of curiosity about the sheer weirdness of it, and a desire to look at things from different angles to see what it is I'm dealing with.  But since these are metaphors, and not just places, each one is sort of a puzzle to uncover: OK, there's a tower here, but what does it mean?  What does it represent?  And since the metaphors are coming from some weird place deep in the GM's subconscious (or, if it's a "module", from someplace in the game creator's subconscious), this means trying to understand something about how the GM's subconscious works -- sort of deciphering a symbolic language.  A scene is engaging for me as a player if the initial vision of the scene is intriguing or puzzling enough to make me want to explore it and try to figure it out.<br/><br/>Finally, you could try to motivate me by appealing to my sympathies: there are people in this scene -- NPCs, either literal people or some kind of weird metaphorical stand-in for people, like talking stuffed animals or a bunch of ants in a colony -- some of them are suffering, or inflicting cruelties on each other: something the player will find disturbing enough to not be able to ignore.  (I think this is what you were trying to get at with your line of people jumping off the tower.)  Simply turning away from it is also a choice -- the choice to ignore the suffering of others, to block it out, run away, pretend it doesn't exist -- and that choice should have serious consequences too.  In the line of people on the tower, do I find a face I recognize?  (That would be a great place for the Mountain Witch Trick...)  A scene is engaging for me if it makes me want to intervene to stop, or change, what's happening.<br/><br/>Am I rehashing stuff that you already know, or am I barking up the wrong tree, or is some of this maybe helpful?<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147505/#Comment_147505" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T00:57:37+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 12:57AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I'm going to propose a way that those three things could potentially be put together to create interesting situations.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of interactive-fiction games as a model.  Have you played any?  Interactive fiction started out with text-adventure computer games like Zork and Adventure, but in recent years a thriving creative community has grown up around authoring non-commercial interactive fiction and sharing it free on the internet; they've moved away from the solve-this-hairy-puzzle-to-get-the-treasure model of the early games towards things that are more interactive and exploratory and story-focused.  (It's an interesting parallel for the indie-RPG movement, but I digress...)<br/><br/>The reason I think of interactive-fiction is because in those games, most often your character is a complete blank.  You're just "you", a nameless, faceless avatar.  In some of them you discover more about your own character as you progress, but in others your identity simply isn't important.  Thinking about the child in the mask has reminded me of this type of game.<br/><br/>The main focus of interactive-fiction play is that you're in a place, there are various things you can interact with, and you can poke at them to see what they do or ask the computer for more information about them.  And there's a "solution" -- some action which, once you figure it out, causes a useful change in the environment, which usually opens up new areas for exploration.<br/><br/>So, formula for creating a situation:  Here's a strange (in an intriguing or puzzling way) dream-scene.  There are "people" in it being cruel to each other, to the player, or to themselves.  Their suffering, or their cruelty, is related somehow to the abuse that made the child a victim in the first place.  Some action that the player could take towards one or more of these people will help the child towards taking the mask off.  Other actions the player could take towards one or more of these people will move the child towards becoming a monster.  For the player to figure out which is which, the player must first figure out the metaphorical meaning of the scene -- crack the code, as it were, solve the puzzle, to figure out what actions metaphorically represent healthy/healing behaviors and what actions metaphorically represent harmful behaviors that will perpetuate the cycle of abuse.<br/><br/>Is that the kind of thing you're going for?  Maybe you were already doing that in your playtest, but from reading the description you gave of the tower scene, it felt a little bit aimless at first.  I'm thinking the aimlessness might be lessened if the GM and player had a shared understanding of what the possible range of outcomes of the scene might be and how they could impact the larger goal of play.  So I'm proposing a framework that makes that explicit.  The motivation of the player to seek out a better ending for the child, to do something about the suffering that's going on, and also the player's curiosity about the meaning of the surrealism of the scene, would all be tied together, hopefully making the scene engaging for the player.<br/><br/>On the other hand, maybe you think the idea of each scene being built around Finding The Solution To the Puzzle is too mechanistic or too computer-game like to work with what you want to do?<br/><br/>(There doesn't have to be just one "solution to the puzzle"; better if there's a whole range of actions that can result in progress, and they don't all have to be predecided either.  Maybe the GM already knows the metaphorical meaning of the scene, and has a particular "solution" in mind, but maybe the GM doesn't know either, so it's more a matter of the player asking questions and trying different actions until the GM realizes that something just feels right and decides, at that moment, that that's how it's going to be.  So the player's questions and statements may help the GM to understand the meaning of an image which was previously unclear?  I'm getting the impression that you want this game to have at least a little bit of the nature of a psychotherapy-session-for-the-GM in it.  Am I right? )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147506/#Comment_147506" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T01:07:12+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  1:07AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the super-long posts, but once I get started on a train of thought it's hard for me to stop.<br/><br/>Another thought:  Have you seen "Groundhog Day"?  There's a situation (a single day) that keeps repeating and repeating until the guy 'solves' it by finding a way to turn everything bad in the day into something positive.  Maybe you could use something like that?  The player can keep revisiting a scene and can try different things, with different outcomes, until finally an action is found that represents healing or a positive way of dealing with the abuse?<br/><br/>Maybe there are several scenes linked together, such that players can take their pick of which one they are most interested in engaging with, and if they feel like they can't make progress with one scene, they can go "work on" another one for a while. (if you wander away from the tower, you end up at the river with the skeletal ferryman and the dancing fishbones, if you wander away from the river you end up at the house where all the floors keep collapsing away into darkness, and if you wander away from the house you end up back at the tower -- hey, it's a dream world, location is meaningless, right?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.
