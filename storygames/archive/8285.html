Heck, *I* think the idea of shuffling the skills and changing the Aspects to be golden: practically the perfect mechanical implementation of how characters change in fiction, but people were continuously concerned about the fact that you did not get to be "even more badass" (as if you needed it...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182671/#Comment_182671" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T14:27:17+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  2:27PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Advancement?

Surely we can do better than just focus on a given mechanic and say that it's important to us in isolation?<br><br>In other words: I have no idea if advancement is important to me in a given game.

Those games are built so that advancement is important <b>in them</b>. It's not me, it's the game. I'd have to be an idiot to claim that advancement of characters is somehow intrinsically important or non-important to roleplaying games when there are plenty of examples of both types of games out there.

How important is an advancement system in your choosing whether or not to play a game? Does it make you more or less likely to want to play a game? I understand the argument that some games require it, and others don't. But just like you may be more or less interested in a game because it's got fantastical elements, or it uses dice, or it is GMless, I think advancement issues are one area which can make a game more or less interesting to some people.<br/><br/>Now, if it doesn't matter to you, if all that matters is how the gestalt works, then that's a fine answer too.

At least, that's the case in the language used on my show.<br/><br/>One of the issues in a Mythender playtest was how boring it felt to have the play be static, when someone used the same character in three different battles, which felt similar enough because the mechanics well all the same and it's fairly freeform in how you do stuff.  I learned then that something has to keep changing.  Now, if it's situation, then maybe you don't need any sort of advancement -- DRYH works fine for that.  But if you have something more formulaic like, say, D&amp;D, then you need some sort of advancement.  Change the characters and/or change the situation.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>Oh, a weird side note: DnD 4E has practically NO advancement, at all, if you follow the rules, does it?</blockquote>\nYou may not increase with relative power, but what you have is a different game than one at lower levels.  The mechanics change, which keeps the game fresh (or at least fresher than it would otherwise be).  Of course, you note that, but it's not a trivial thing to note.<br/><br/>(That, and you could always have an encounter of lower level than the PCs, to show them how much they have changed.)<br/><br/>Naturally, you don't need advancement if you one-shot everything, because you have the change built into what you're doing socially.<br/><br/>Edit: To answer Rob's question, I desire change in my gaming.  If advancement is how I get it, awesome.  But it's not necessary, provided the change comes from somewhere else.  (But, I am skewed because I have yet to play in any campaign that has lasted more than 10 sessions, and 90% of them have lasted no more than six.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182692/#Comment_182692" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T15:26:10+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  3:26PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good shift of perspective, that.

I want advancement in a game if the starting position of my character is one I'm not happy with. I think this could go in different directions. For example:<br/><br/>a. My character is useless and boring to play, and I need to play to make him better. (A common assumption in many RPGs throughout RPG history.)<br/>b. The narrative arc is about the character developing the skills or the balls to handle the adversity present. I need to play in order to get my character the improvements necessary to achieve the right ending to the story. (Maybe a sappy love story about the ugly duckling who turns into a prince and wins the girl? Also, building up Love in MLwM.)<br/><br/>2. Advancement could be a good thing if the game is highly tactical, and advancement means discovery of tactical options and a built-in way of learning the game.<br/><br/>Kind of like how, in (older versions of) D&amp;D, starting characters are mechanically simple, and as you play you gain new powers and the tactics become more and more complex. That serves a nice purpose--start at a simple level you can grasp, then advance to the more complex stuff. Instead of character/story changing or being transformed, the tactical choices are changing or being transformed.<br/><br/>(I don't know how much sense it makes to tie that to character success, as opposed to player success, though.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182698/#Comment_182698" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T15:56:32+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  3:56PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I think about what change might be that isn't advancement, I can see that a game could have change without advancement and be interesting to me.

(That's right, I'm the guy.  Don't worry, I doubt it's contagious.)<br/><br/>I typically have a lot of stuff I want my character to do and to get involved with in a game, and frequently the distance between that and what the character actually <i>can</i> do is big.  Without advancement, I've got nothing to aim for; I mean, I suppose that I could aim higher than whatever my character could currently accomplish, but it'd be a stupid and frustrating waste of time because there'd be no way to actually get there.  Big goals are fun for me if there's a reasonable possibility that those goals will ever be attainable.  Otherwise, they're just window dressing -- who cares if you want to kill the evil tyrant if you'll never be more than a low-rent caravan guard who'll never get within a hundred miles of the guy?<br/><br/>There are other things I like about character advancement, of course.  It's a nice way to extend a game's lifespan, by opening up new kinds of challenges and resources to play with.  It lets me adjust a character as we play (addressing oversights from character creation, or changing my character's niche, or whatever).  And frankly, I just plain like the whole process; thinking about and planning that stuff out is <i>fun</i>, god damn it.  It's one of the things that I like to do on my own when we're not playing, and makes the time when we do sit down to play together better for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182706/#Comment_182706" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T16:13:46+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  4:13PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Rob,<br/><br/>It heavily depends on what sort of game I'm playing.  In a lot of games, transformation is all that really matters (the shuffling and re-writing that you mentioned at the beginning).  In others it's dreadfully important.<br/><br/>For example, I'm currently playing in a high-fantasy wuxia game where all the PCs started off as brand-new students in a remote temple.  Implicit in the setting and setup of the game is that we will strive, train, learn, fail, grow, and work our way up from unskilled children into kung fu bad-asses.  That requires improvement to some degree, and it's definitely something that's reflected in the genre's fiction as well.  I think that playing this game without any advancement and just constantly re-writing traits from "New student of Master Broken Mountain with Slopes Shod in Iron" to "Master of the Five Winds Kick" could work, but it would be a lot less satisfying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182714/#Comment_182714" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T16:57:05+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  4:57PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not opposed to advancement, but it's not something I look for, expect, hope to see, or write in.

Let's just say.<br/><br/>In a narrative, it is rare that the character gets more powerful as a result of trying to inflict its will upon the world. (Hero's Journey stories are a case where this is quite common, but I can't think of many others) Most the time, development of attributes and character qualities happens as a result of practice and meditation (a form of practice?), and even then the advancement isn't going to be significant unless mapped across years. <br/><br/>In a narrative, it is common that the character gains more situational power as a result of trying to inflict its will upon the world. It allows you to jockey for a better vantage point, it puts you in a place where you can address an untenable situation that was previously out of your capacity to deal with.<br/><br/>Do I care about intrinsic advancement? No. I don't want my character to grow strong as a result of fighting. That advancement is whatever.<br/>Do I care about situational advancement? Yes. If I don't gain a "Peasant Hero 1D" Reputation, or change the situation in a way that allows me to roll my Story Goal next session, or gain a 3-bead relationship with the God of Seven Shoulders... then I feel a disappointed.<br/><br/>I like to feel like engaging in the story opens up opportunities to affect the story in a way I couldn't at first. I like the idea that this power/advancement is situational to the story, and that to be more powerful in a DIFFERENT story I'll have to work through a similar process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182746/#Comment_182746" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T21:03:39+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  9:03PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would consider acquisition of wealth in Traveller to be a form of advancement (not that I ever had sustained Traveller play without houseruled advancement).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182747/#Comment_182747" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T21:11:35+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  9:11PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unfortunately wealth is usually disconnected mechanically from practically everything else in games that track literal wealth (well, since D&amp;D scrapped the "XP for gold" idea -- something I am only now wondering about).

This is leaving aside non-mechanical advancement such as gaining improved equipment, riches, achieving goals and ambitions, advancing the story and the like, which are advancement of a different kind and are needed to keep a game interesting if you don't have mechanical advancement. Indeed, a mix of the two is better IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. These are games. When viewed strictly as a game, mechanical advancement can be seen as a distinct measure as to how 'well' you are doing in the game. In effect, levelling up or improving your percentile skill or whatever is saying "Well done. You are getting better at this game." Take that away and you have no solid measure other than achievements. You either need this advancement measure, or if you don't care about it, you need the non-mechanical advancement. Otherwise, you are treading water and i wager it gets very boring, very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Long-term campaigns. In running a long-term game (i've heard of 20 year campaigns! Several of mine have lasted 4 or 5 years) i suggest that to keep things interesting you need a barometer of some sort. I don't think it's a coincidence that most traditional games designed for long-term gaming have solid mechanical advancement systems. If you are running short 4-5 session or one off games, then non-mechanical advancement is more than adequate. I don't know if you could run a 5 year campaign with just non-mechanical advancement and keep it flowing and interesting (never done it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182774/#Comment_182774" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T02:56:38+00:00" title="December 11, 2008  2:56AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Dan">@Dan</a>: your point '1' would be 'reward', not strictly 'advancement', according to Luke's speech in Ryan's show, and I agree with you.

I don't mind that IAWA or Shock or whatever doesn't offer mechanical improvement of the characters over continued play, because that's not what the game is about, or the way it's played. But in a 5 year campaign you really need to be able take on new sorts and scales of challenges over time or it becomes unplayable.<br/><br/>Sure those could be smaller and simpler challanges than the ones before (if you want to play a game about a fall from power maybe) but human nature being what it is we tend to prefer ones where you get to take on bigger and vaster challenges with your new and improved abilities.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>In a narrative, it is rare that the character gets more powerful as a result of trying to inflict its will upon the world. (Hero's Journey stories are a case where this is quite common, but I can't think of many others) Most the time, development of attributes and character qualities happens as a result of practice and meditation (a form of practice?), and even then the advancement isn't going to be significant unless mapped across years.</blockquote>\nNow of course what I am saying here is a direct counter to Joe's statement about narratives, but I have to say I think there is a style of fiction where this is exactly what happens, the Fantasy novel sequence that begins with weak characters taking on limited threats and follows them as they gain more and more powers and take on bigger and bigger threats till the climax. The Lord of the Rings does this for the Hobbits (they start off as farmers and then gain magic items, and weapons training, and bravery and so on), anything David Eddings ever wrote does this for the main characters, and so on.<br/><br/>This is a style of fiction that many RPGs (like D&amp;D, WRFP, Palladium etc.) have set themselves up to emulate, and I suspect they also support it, in that a lot of people who have written such books now have experienced that sort of story from RPG experience. This is also the style of fiction that is the common mainstay of most 3 year+ campaigns, which makes advancement essential for them. Certainly my normal play group, while happy to dabble with short-form games, regard it as not "real roleplaying" unless it involves multi-year games and strong character advancement.

If anything, the game already has an un-advancement system, and that rocks on toast.<br/><br/>If you are going to add some kind of advancement system, let YOs add a freeform trait at the end of each game session. Let them sell it out like other traits, and downgrade it to something creepy, just like normal. This way, even though they're advancing and increasing their ability to affect the win outcome, they're also increasing their potential to become an annoying sell-out a-dolt, which is what it's all about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182808/#Comment_182808" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T07:54:28+00:00" title="December 11, 2008  7:54AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob,<br/>\n  To me, Advancement is part of the challenge mechanism.

If becoming wealthy advances a character, then the best way to advance is to play a character who does almost nothing story-relevant. Unless the story is about starting a small business and growing it into an empire, I guess. Worked for Orson Welles, so what do I know? Maybe it is interesting.</blockquote>\nTrue, wealth, at least GP in D&amp;D, in some editions, has little meaning. In the early days, XP for GP tied wealth into the advancement system. In 3.x, wealth allows you to buy magic items and thus is also advancement.<br/><br/>In Traveller, wealth allows you to buy better equipment and bigger ships, and ties pretty directly into play in the games I've played in or watched. Thus it is a form of advancement.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182820/#Comment_182820" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T09:00:08+00:00" title="December 11, 2008  9:00AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, interesting corollary/food for thought:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3147/3043339133_e4b33a1102.jpg?v=0"/> <br/><br/>The J-RPG "School Days Panic!" has no character advancement (all the characters are high school kids, but also cyborgs/wizards/swordsmen/ninjas/supersoldiers/vampires/etc). However, you interact with set NPC characters in the school (54 IIRC, one for every card in a trump deck plus jokers). You get about 2-3 characters to interact with at character generation, IIRC.<br/><br/>Anyway, each NPC has a sheet which is about the size of a business card. As you go through the game, you "advance" your relationship with that character, from some number (1-4) up to 10. At certain "ranks", the NPC changes their relationship with you, culminating with 10, which symbolizes a really close relationship with you.<br/><br/>Frex, for the punk girl who smokes outside of school, at like "rank 4" she starts calling you by name, and not "Hey You". At "rank 7" (or so) she stops smoking around you. At rank 9 you find out (or she tells you) about how she became an outcast. At rank 10 she makes a homemade lunchbox (fish, rice, cookies etc) for you.<br/><br/>I'd like to see more of that kind of advancement. Sure, my Celerity went from 2 to 3 dots at some point. But I want to sink my eeps into Janus Blackthorne, the Prince of San Diego and nicknamed "The Duke of Hell". At 4 dots the duke stops scheming against me and considers me a worthy opponent/friend/successor. At 7 dots he tells me about his backstory. At 9 dots he sets me up to be his successor. At 10 dots he makes a homemade lunchbox (fish, rice, cookies).<br/><br/>Something like that.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182821/#Comment_182821" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T09:07:51+00:00" title="December 11, 2008  9:07AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite><br/>If the tastiest part of advancement -- especially in a game like D&amp;D, which someone (correctly) pointed out has zero-sum advancement -- is to escalate the scale of the fiction (i.e. "start small and end epic"), you could achieve the same thing by introducing a "fictional scale advancement" mechanism.

There are quite a few notches along said scale that can eventually lead up to determining the fate of an entire people.<br/><br/>There are also a couple of mechanical bits associated with each level of scale, but they're not really applied to the character, they're applied to the situations the character experiences in the fiction.<br/><br/>It's been a while, but that's how I recall things working.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182841/#Comment_182841" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T10:54:11+00:00" title="December 11, 2008 10:54AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the relationship advancement mechanic Andy is talking about.

But you have a story goal, which you will reach once you've played out 10 scenes related to that goal. It might be like, "keep 10 tokens, with each scene throw one away. Once you're out of tokens, you achieve your story goal." Or it might be like, "Your story goal score is 0. With each scene, add one to it. When it reaches 10, you achieve your story goal."<br/><br/>Is this "advancement", and relevant to this thread? The character's not changing (necessarily), the world isn't necessarily changing. But the _story_ is being advanced. It's also a pacing mechanism.<br/><br/>So, is that advancement?<br/><br/>And another question:<br/><br/>Is getting better at a game "advancement"? Like, if we play IaWA, and we enjoying watching each other get better at it. Or we watch each other build a fantasy world together, and watch it grow.

When choosing whether to play a game, when evaluating your enjoyment of a game, how important is it to you to have your character advance?<br/><br/>By advancement here, I mean for the character to improve, build, get better, level. I explicitly do not mean just<i>change</i>(e.g., get worse, shuffle and rewrite but not improve, etc.).</blockquote>\nLike many topics, my answer would be "it depends".  The interesting question is what it depends on.  There are a couple of factors that I can think of.  <br/><br/>1) Does the advancement happen at the end of the session, or is it marked immediately (like in Dogs in the Vineyard XP or James Bond Hero Points)?  Immediate marking is good for making advancement interesting -- but it also disrupts the flow of the game more.  The more complicated the advancement, the more it disrupts the session.  I find that immediate advancement means I'm much more likely to play the system to maximize my advancement.  End-of-session or end-of-mission awards like many Artha awards (MVP, workhorse, etc.) don't motivate me to maximize my gains, though I may like getting them.  <br/><br/>2) Is the benefit just advancing an existing numeric stat (i.e. +2 Strength, or change "I'm a Dog" from 2d8 to 3d8), or does it add something new to the character (i.e. gain followers, a new maneuver, or a new trait)?  New things are more interesting, but if you keep adding new things then the character becomes more and more complex.  Even if you're switching out old benefits for new ones, the change makes understanding the character more difficult.  I tend to prefer a mix.  <br/><br/>3) Is the advancement personal, material, or social?  Some systems allow the player a choice of any (i.e. a broad system like Champions where you could buy a new contact/follower/sidekick/etc., or a system with universal traits for all three), while others treat these as different tracks.  For me, it really depends on the setting and genre what I think fits.  <br/><br/>4) Is the advancement a permanent benefit (i.e. +3 to all combat rolls) or temporary points to spend (i.e. five points each giving +2 to a roll)?  I like having a mix, as long as I have some resources to spend.  <br/><br/>Something that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> make me think of that I haven't seen -- lining up a new benefit in advance (so it is more interesting) that is activated by something during play (so the reward is more immediate).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182899/#Comment_182899" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T13:02:36+00:00" title="December 11, 2008  1:02PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I like advancement in some games, and not others. I cannot imagine Misspent Youth with an advancement system, though. It is about the slow, downward spiral to adulthood, right? If anything, the game already has an un-advancement system, and that rocks on toast.<br/><br/>If you are going to add some kind of advancement system, let YOs add a freeform trait at the end of each game session. Let them sell it out like other traits, and downgrade it to something creepy, just like normal. This way, even though they're advancing and increasing their ability to affect the win outcome, they're also increasing their potential to become an annoying sell-out a-dolt, which is what it's all about.</blockquote>\nI agree with Adam here, in that I can't imagine Misspent Youth with an advancement system. Part of its appeal is the inevitability that a character will grow up and retire.<br/><br/>On the second respect, I think that adding on another Trait would work against that. Character "death" is no longer inevitable if you can go a whole session without selling out.<br/><br/>Shadow of Yesterday, Don't Rest Your Head and (I think) Grey Ranks all have this duality where advancement is also decline, or at least moves the character toward the end of his story.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you want to expand out the conflict resolution system with more tactical options, a la D&amp;D, then advancement is a good way to mete them out.<br/><br/>-Grant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182994/#Comment_182994" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T00:48:06+00:00" title="December 12, 2008 12:48AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Grant">@Grant</a> regarding DRYH... its advancement would be the Scars, and they are purely positive mechanical elements.

And, obviously, my own game contained advancement, and that was important to me because that's part of the reward system that's important for that kind of challenge-based play (where advancement allows you to tackle greater challenges).<br/><br/>Most of the time these days, I've shifted my focus elsewhere in the games I play, but I can still enjoy good advancement-based games a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183436/#Comment_183436" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T10:29:41+00:00" title="December 15, 2008 10:29AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Advancement must be a game-changer. When you level up in D&amp;D 4E, you get new abilities and tools. These change how you approach the game. You might have a hard time fighting the 4 kobold slingers when you're 1st level, but then you all level up to 2nd, and that same encounter is much easier. <br/><br/>Any system that changes how your character solves problems in the game is an "advancement" system, even if it doesn't advance you <i>per se</i>. That is, the system could just make your character solve problems in a different way -- not necessarily an easier way -- and that is a kind of advancement system.<br/><br/>The Fallout system of Dogs in the Vineyard is that kind of system, I think. Some of the stuff gives you new traits or more dice; some of it lowers your dice; some of it removes traits. You change how you interact with the world that way, and in Dogs, that means choosing which traits are important to you (and thus making a point of some kind as a reaction to play).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8285/how-important-is-advancement-to-you" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8285/how-important-is-advancement-to-you" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8285/how-important-is-advancement-to-you/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8285%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8285%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
