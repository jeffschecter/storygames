                    OK, so this is my little rant over terminology -- brought on by the discussion of Greg Stafford and Robin Laws in the thread on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1283&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>"You Know What They Say: Once you go Indie..."</b></a><br/><br/>The Forge was founded in 1999 by Ron Edwards and Ed Healy with a vision: to support independent role-playing games.  From the top of the front page since the site was founded, it nicely defined independent role-playing games as having a single primary quality: <i>owned by the author</i>.  When the Indie RPG Awards were founded in 2002 by Andy Kitkowski, there was also a clear definition outlined in its FAQ: owned by the author (specified as over 50% of the text written by the person who has control over publishing).  <br/><br/>But now in several places, I see people using "indie RPG" to mean an RPG typical of the current Forge output, even though Forge participants have released a variety of games from Sorcerer to JAGS to Polaris to Perfect20 to Mechaton.  So there's talk about whether Robin Laws or Greg Stafford's games are "indie" even if they aren't creator-owned.  <br/><br/>Can you <i>please</i> use a different term?!?  There is many years of clearly defined usage -- including from the foundation of the Forge itself -- on what "indie RPGs" are.  There are tons of alternate choices depending on what you're trying to say: "thematic games", "story games", whatever.  But it drives me nuts to see people talk about Forge-inspired games while ripping to shreds the Forge's own terminology.                </div>

                            Hey folks, welcome to the wonderful world of the meme-pool.<br/><br/>I figure the resilience and spread of "Indie" is part and parcel of the same wonderful broth that gave us the explosion of "Go Play."<br/><br/>Ain't nothin' to be done.  The meme-pool is beyond being controlled.  Like a rambunctious 80-foot tall toddler, the best you can do is to occasionally tempt it with candies or something shiny, and hope it steps on your enemies rather than your friends.                        </div>

                            Well, I agree that it is inevitable that terms will be used in illogical ways.  For example, people will tend to say what their stereotype is.

<p>You talk with your mouth full of words. I think flippancy is not serving you well.</p>
<p>Everyone,</p>
<p>This business has got to stop. "Indie" or "independent" or whatever is about a method of publication, not content. Period. That method of publication is exciting and awesome and I want to continue to talk about it and support it and rock out. Mixing your admittedly great style of game into that semiotically is not awesome. It manages to marginalize other types of games published with the indie method.</p>
<p>Also, re: HeroQuest. Here's the Real Deal (tm). I don't know whether it's independent or not. I know that one of my best friends in the world is Ron Edwards, and he's as smart as you or I and cares more about independent publication than anyone I know. And I asked him, "Ron, is HeroQuest independent," and he said he'd investigated all the facts, and, yep, it is. And I trust him.</p>

Part of the reason that it's becoming so diluted is that there are ... what? ... maybe three or four companies left that aren't two guys in a garage with Adobe CS and dream?<br/><br/>Granted, the non-independent games are high-profile - mostly due to the sheer volume involved because they're <i>not</i> independently produced.<br/><br/>But aside from WotC, White Wolf and Palladium ... whose game <i>isn't</i> indie?<br/><br/>Frankly, I'm not all that concerned with the label, mainly because I never plan to try and leverage the brand.                        </div>

Well, that would be Mongoose Publishing, Green Ronin, FanPro, Eden Studios, Alderac Entertainment, Steve Jackson Games, Atlas Games, Chaosium, Columbia Games, and various others.  They're small, but as far as I know they don't give ownership of the games published to the author.  For example -- Atlas came out with "The Infernal" for Ars Magica by authors Erik Dahl, Timothy Ferguson, and Mark Shirley.  I don't know for sure, but I'd bet good odds that head John Nephew still controlled and owned the publication rather than the authors themselves. <br/><br/>That still leaves a lot of independent publications -- but that's always been true.  Browse through publishing by year and you'll always find a bunch of indie games.  For example: here's the list of reviews which were up when the Forge was young in 1999:  <br/><br/>- Army Ants; written by Michael T. Desing<br/>- Badlands; written by Charles R. Capko Jr.<br/>- Cosmic Synchronicity; written by Joseph Teller<br/>- Dominion Rules; published by Dominion Games<br/>- Orbit; written by Jeff Diamond<br/>- Forge: Out of Chaos; written by The Brotherhood<br/>- FRP Project; written by Chris Magoun<br/>- Ghost Light; written by Doug Bolden<br/>- The Guide to Adventure; written by Michael Ball<br/>- octaNe; written by Jared A. Sorensen<br/>- Puppetland; written by John Tynes<br/>- Simplex; written by Pieter Simmons<br/>- Stuper Powers!; written by Fred VanLente &amp; Carson Jones<br/>- Swashbuckler!; written by Jim Dietz<br/>- The Window; written by Scott Lininger<br/><br/>You'll find many small indie games like this in the seventies and eighties as well.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/><br/>Yes!  I'm totally with you guys.  We who are indie publishers need to stress that "Indie" when attatched to RPGs is a dicription of a publication model- not a guideline for content.  Indie means author owned and produced.  A fantasy heartbreaker is an Indie game.  Indie does not mean: story-focussed, non-licensed, or GMless.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

Hey Clinton- I think the exasperation expressed by John (I feel it too) is that on RPGNet and the like we see people open new threads ALL THE TIME (there's one on the front page now) with "Recommend me an Indie Game!"  "What are Good Indie Games?" etc. So it's not really us that need to be preached to, but rather Everyone Else. John wants to use new terms. Tony well describes how hard it is to get a term implemented by the masses: Every single person here, plus half the "internets!!" will use Indie as Publishing only, and yet still a year later we'll see these "Recommend me an Indie Game! I love how they all come from the Forge and have a tight focus!" threads. (at which point we all carry on the same conversation we have in Every Thread Like This: "Hey Poster X, Indie simply refers to self-publishing and author-controlled yadda yadda" while others simply dive in with "Buy Polaris and PTA and TSOY and Capes and...")
<blockquote>But aside from WotC, White Wolf and Palladium ... whose game isn't indie?</blockquote>
Kuma, here's my litmus test. It's not 100% but it's damned close:<br/><br/>Can the author of the game (the "dude in charge" who had a significant hand in writing the game) suddenly decide that he wants to print off 1,000 copies, and do it?  Can that same person decide that they want their game to never be sold/produced again, and completely shut down production on it?  Or can that person decide 2 months later that they want to revise and sell their game again, and do so? If YES to all the above, that's Indie.                        </div>

                            The challenge is that the term was borrowed from other creative arenas, and while 'indie' in films/music etc often revolves around owner or non-major produced works, there's also an expectation of differences in form and content. <br/><br/>I agree with tonyLB that this broader definition will probably prevail in one way or another in the rpg context. <br/><br/>While I agree with the original point that indie should not equal forgeish games, a broader definition of indie as 'owner created + usually non-mainstream in some way' is more useful to more people than the strict definition (although it will cause some confusion).                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>  Hey Clinton- I think the exasperation expressed by John (I feel it too) is that on RPGNet and the like we see people open new threads ALL THE TIME (there's one on the front page now) with "Recommend me an Indie Game!"  "What are Good Indie Games?" etc. So it's not really us that need to be preached to, but rather Everyone Else. John wants to use new terms. Tony well describes how hard it is to get a term implemented by the masses: Every single person here, plus half the "internets!!" will use Indie as Publishing only...</blockquote>
OK, this is why it is a rant of mine.  Using "indie" to describe publishing is <i>not</i> a "new term".  It's been prominently posted as the official definition on The Forge for fucking seven years!!  It's still there!!  <br/><br/>We're constantly fighting to correct other people's misusage of other terms, like "Conflict Resolution" and "Stakes" and "Narrativist".  Do you want to just give up on those misusages to, and just say "Well, people will say use them to mean whatever they want."  ??  <br/><br/>It's also not "narrow".  It covers a huge range of games, from Army Ants to Mechaton to JAGS to My Life With Master.  As others have noted, there are tons of indie publishers and always have been.  The alternative seems to be a vague and ill-defined term for "like what's typical of The Forge" -- which will inevitably mean cutting out games which don't have the right cred.  i.e. "Oh, Army Ants?  That's not thematic enough to be indie."                        </div>

                            John, Clinton, et al, I'm in 100% agreement. <br/><br/>Indie is awesome! System-focused design is also awesome. They're two different things and we do them both a disservice when we lump them together.<br/><br/>Andy, it bothers me that people conflate the two ideas on RPGnet (not least because it causes other non-Forge indie designers to feel that they are not welcome at The Forge, despite the fact that it exists as a resource for people just like them).<br/><br/>At the same time, I see the conflation happening right here. And when WE do it, it is inevitable that others who are not part of our community will start to do it as well. Of course we can't stop it entirely. But we can choose to make a hard distinction and help it proliferate.                        </div>

<p>John,</p>
<p>Here's where I say the thing that will make enemies. People don't fight to correct the misusage of the term because they like the way it's misused.</p>
<p>Jimmy the ultra-thematic gamer doesn't want or need to share a label with Julie, the lady writing a really cool light-weight traditional fantasy RPG. So when someone asks Jimmy about this "indie game" thing he's heard about, Jimmy talks about his fruity game and Vance's fruity game, and Abraham's totally fruity game about playing immortal historical documents. He does not mention Julie's game, and for that, he is somewhat of an ass. His publication model was built on the back of Julie's, and he is kicking the person whose shoulders he is standing on.</p>

                            Guys I feel your pain but let's remember that the term indie has been used in music and film for years before The Forge grabbed it for games, and even there the term is subject to dispute. So it has existing associations and if you did not want to carry those you needed to pick a new term. You can't ride the coat tails of an existting term and escape its existing meanings.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere the term means low-budget and not produced by a major studio/label. But perhaps what is more important is that decisions about the product are driven by the creative agenda not the commercial agenda. In other words you don't compromise vision for market share. To make that sacrifice is to 'sell out'.<br/>
<br/>
Now while The Forge definition of 'crrator-owned' can be a great yardstick for creative vs commercial priorities it's not a solid test. After all the new Star Wars films are technically indie because they are creator-owned, but while Lucas has tried to claim the indie mantle, I don't think most people consider them to be so. Lucas 'sold out', IMO.<br/>
<br/>
Your definition could lead you down these paths in gaming too, is a heavily comercial product starts wearing the indie tag. Is Rifts 'creator-owned' by Kevin and thus indie for example? Are you happy for him to flaunt that tag.<br/>
<br/>
I'd stick with a tag that recognizes a non-commercially driven product, instead focused on a creative endeavour. So HeroQuest is indie, Mongoose RuneQuest isn't.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that you cannot avoid slippage of meaning in language. Any reader comes to the text with their own web of associations with the words you use, that will colour thier intepretation of what you say. See Locke's Essay on Human Understanding, or Derrida's Structure Sign and Play in the Human sciences. You can't control meaning and it will break your heart to try. You can't enforce this so it will escape you.                        </div>

Yup, that's exactly it.  And I think that association is fine.  That is exactly the meaning that I'd be trying for.  What an indie films does *not* imply is a particular kind of content.  There are indie horror films, indie dramas, indie documentaries, indie shorts, indie animation, and so forth.  And a 90-million dollar Steven Spielberg film isn't "indie" regardless of how cool Spielberg is, or how he is able to follow his vision.  <br/><br/>What I'm opposed to is the concept that an indie RPG has to look like X (i.e. has to be like Sorcerer or Dogs in the Vineyard or whatever) or else it isn't indie.  And that's exactly what people are driving at when they redefine it.  Games like <a href="http://www.threesagesgames.com/index.html" rel="nofollow"><b>The Realm of Wor</b></a> or <a href="http://www.galileogames.com/legendofyore/index.html" rel="nofollow"><b>The Legend of Yore</b></a> are just as indie as Shock:.                        </div>

                            For clarity &amp; disclosure.<br/>
<br/>
I stand by my original assessment of Hero Wars, and later HeroQuest, as independent based on my discussion of finances and content control with Greg Stafford.<br/>
<br/>
In the last year, however, those conditions have changed, and to the credit of everyone involved, they were gracious enough to let me know too. So the HeroQuest forum at the Forge is now in the twilight phase that the Riddle of Steel forum was in for a while, when its ownership changed. I'm kind of a slow guy when it comes to this stuff, but that process is indeed under way.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this was a bit of a detour from the topic, but just in case, y'know?<br/>
<br/>
To get back on topic, though, I guess what puzzles me - and I'm not asking for alternate views or explanations or whatever, that's your biz - is why usage at other websites seems to matter to any of us. I fully agree that such things are not subject to control, and I don't really sweat the fact that "indie" or dozens of other terms get twisted into new forms in what amount to isolated, highly-charged pockets of social competition on the internet. I don't understand why it's a source of concern. Again, please don't try to educate me about this (why I should care, or why you do). I did not request that.<br/>
<br/>
In the long term, the concept of independent that Clinton and I have championed, exactly as John describes it here, has proven its worth. I think it's especially done so in the context of a real market, rather than people with trust funds stuffing distributors' warehouses and stores' shelves with hyper-promoted promises. It's that long term that interested me the most at the outset of all this effort on my part, and which continues to be my focus of attention.<br/>

Ron, please understand I'm not trying to answer your unasked request. I think.<br><br>I'm gonna do a no-no on the above paragraph via editing, to get a comment I respond to. If I misstate, please correct me.
<blockquote>To get back on topic, though, I guess what puzzles me [...] is why usage at other websites seems to matter to any of us. [...]  I don't understand why it's a source of concern.</blockquote>
Ultimately, I think the answer to the first part of this is related to the second part of this: it's a source of concern for some people to be labeled, using a label whose definition they do not agree with or find actively incorrect.<br><br>I mean, if folks called one of my games "a Forge-developed game" or "a GURPS supplement" or "a garden weasel" or "a dietary supplement" or said "PDQ games use a d30" then that's an incorrect reflection of the nature of the game. (I think this example is more extreme than the wrangle over the "indie" term, but hey, hyperbole.)<br><br>Now, while I think that's why it matters to some people, you're raising an excellent point: should it matter? (Again, if I'm putting words in your mouth, correct me.)<br><br>I think the only elements of this labeling and terminology foofahrah that are really important are related to "factual information about a game" (as discussed above) and "marketing/public relations of a game" (if a game is being greatly mischaracterized repeatedly, then that's sure to have a negative effect on sales).<br><br>So, to sum up, I think that the core issue of the "indie" discussion, once you peel away the social community factors, revolved around marketing. . . Though I'm not sure many people would phrase it that way.<br><br>CU                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Even still, the "indie = Forgey" meme seems to have taken hold pretty strongly, and I'm not sure what can really be done to avert it. There are plenty of kickass games out there -- Truth &amp; Justice for one, and I hear good things about StarCluster -- that don't fit into the cliche Forge aesthetic that deserve more attention than they might be getting.                        </div>

Thanks, John!* I actually hew pretty close to the Forge definition at IPR, although there are several games I carry that I suspect wouldn't pass Ron's test. I aim for publishers small enough that traditional distribution is just stupid for them. I know that since we called the site "Indie Press Revolution" we muddied the waters a bit.<br/><br/>* I wrote The Legend of Yore, for folks who don't know. And John gets props for spelling it correctly, too (not Legends of Yore as so many cite).                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Edwards</cite>I guess what puzzles me - and I'm not asking for alternate views or explanations or whatever, that's your biz - is why usage at other websites seems to matter to any of us. I fully agree that such things are not subject to control, and I don't really sweat the fact that "indie" or dozens of other terms get twisted into new forms in what amount to isolated, highly-charged pockets of social competition on the internet. I don't understand why it's a source of concern. Again, please don't try to educate me about this (why I should care, or why you do).</blockquote>
Well, just to clarify, my initial rant was primarily about unclear usage here on <i>this</i> website (i.e. story-games.com), not about other websites.  Hence my link in to the "Once you go indie..." thread, for example.  There, I was like "OK, so I guess I went indie with Fudge and Theatrix in the early nineties -- though maybe Spellcrafter in 1987 counted, but I don't think that's what the posters intended."                        </div>

                            By the way, I don't want to be a complete stickler about the definition.  For example, if Greg Stafford had a notable degree of creative control (which I'm perfectly willing to believe), then I'll accept Hero Wars as independent.  I'm also fine with "Indie Press Revolution" being mostly-but-not-entirely independent, including some small presses which don't give creator control. <br/><br/>My rant was over the general principle that "indie" is about the creator control, i.e. independence, not about being a particular kind of game design.  <br/><br/>P.S.  I don't actually own The Legend of Yore -- I only browsed it at a shop, took some notes, and put it back.  But now I have a slight hankering (a la Ron's heartbreaker article) to give it a try.                        </div>

                            The HQ example is interesting. Greg gave MDP the rights to sell HQ product, as well as giving Mongoose the rights to publish Glorantha as MRQ. But he still retains 100% creative control. He actually chooses not to use it a lot lately. But everything that anybody makes that has anything Glorantha in it, Greg can at any time just say no to it. <br/><br/>I don't know if that's Indie or not. I think it should be considered it's own interesting thing. I think it's cool, and it works for Greg (so far). There are some who see it as a very bad thing, however. Those people, I'd guess, like the "traditional" model of RPG production, I guess. So it's radical at least from that POV.<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            I'd agree that there is something different between HeroQuest under MDP and RuneQuest under Mongoose and if we could quantify that it might provide a useful category.<br/>
<br/>
But I also agree that HeroQuest  no longer falls into what the Forge is about, creator-owned games. It's journey is heading in a different direction, for now.                        </div>
