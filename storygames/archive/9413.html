The plot started Spring the same year as the False Black Axe rebellion, and now we are in the following year, trying to find other sympatisers and rebuilding Lockhaven that took a heavy beating in the attack.<br/><br/>The group is huge, about eight players + GM, and we play as long as at least three players show (I am not the GM).  Player background in the hobby varies greatly from the GM with a simulationist background (who wants to see what this Story game fuzz is all about) and me (with a story focus), with about 20 years of experience each to some beginners still struggling with understanding the whole matter of who decides what in the narration, and the rules.<br/><br/>The rules are a problem, everything takes FOREVER, we simply have problems getting any story done at all because the rules are so complex.  After yesterday's game we had a talk, and the next time we play the game will be changed as follows:<br/><br/><b>Skill checks</b><br/>When you roll for a skill check, you roll the dice from that skill as usual.  You can use as many traits as you want. You can draw help from experience in other areas from ONE other skill, rolling it and using any successes as bonus dice on the check.<br/><br/><b>Helping</b><br/>You can get help from ONE other player too, that rolls ONE skill and gives the successes as bonus dice on the check.<br/><br/><b>TSOY style bonus dice</b><br/>Everyone gets five poker chips.  They can be played to give another player a bonus die on any roll, no matter if your PC is in the scene or not. <br/><br/>Chips that remain after the game are discarded, so no point in saving. This will let everyone help if they really want (beyond the ONE player help described above), but without the burden of finding a reason why you can help, just spend the chip.  I hope this will have the positive side effect of keeping players interested in the game, since they now can take part even in scenes where their PCs are not directly involved.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208683/#Comment_208683" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T05:12:33+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  5:12AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2009 5:16AM by Doyce.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...<br/><br/>*thinks*<br/><br/>So... the conflicts are taking too long, and one of the rules hacks is to add a whole extra step to Helping, changing it from a simple "the helpers each give you +1D" to "the helpers have to roll, count success, and hand over +xD to the player".<br/><br/>Actually, to take that a bit further: not <i><b>one</b></i> of those rules hacks addresses your proposed problem of "everything takes too long."  All it does is give the players (probably) more dice to roll. (Okay, maybe not with eight guys around to help on tests. Jesus, that's just too many people.) <br/><br/>Only your own wises can add a die to your roll, btw: not any of your skills.<br/><br/>With Mouseguard and a group your size, I would suggest the following rules hack, just for your group.\n<blockquote><b>It's a Patrol, not a Platoon</b><br/>The first four people who show up get to play. Everyone else can watch quietly, play another game in another room, or go home.<br/></blockquote>\nSeriously: the game is playing slow because there's too many frakking people.

Maybe you can break into 2 groups, even 2 GMs, 4 players could work, and have the groups playing simultaneously in the same areas. Maybe separate them in the GM phase and let them interact in the player phase. They could even start together at the beginning of the GM phase, be given 2 missions, and then players can decide which group players should be in based on the anticipated needs of the mission. 1 player could also act as a co-GM, running the NPCs for the GM. I've done that before and it is quite fun! <br/><br/>What parts of the game are slow for your group? <br/><br/>Some of the above rules sound like they might make things take longer at the benefit of giving players more dice to roll.

I can't imagine playing with 8 people. 3 groups in conflicts? That's insane. Also, you'd be rolling 20 dice or more all the time with that many people able to help you and I can't imagine any enemy is going to survive more than a round if it's facing 3 groups at a time.<br/><br/>Having people succeed more often -- because they have more dice -- is not necessarily in the game's interest.  Sure, you're going to beat enemies faster and overcome challenges more often, but that means you lose a lot of the grittyness of MG and hardly ever gain Conditions, etc.  <br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure what's making everything take forever.  I mean, anything can just be a single or opposed Ob test if you're not interested in an extended conflict, yeah?  You just have, like, one big conflict a session and then roll for other Obs as needed.  And, if you're going by the recommendations in the book, there just aren't that many other Ob rolls you have to make unless you fail some and additionally challenges emerge as complications, yeah?  Which leads me, like Doyce, to suspect that it's the number of players that's the problem, not the rules themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208699/#Comment_208699" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T07:06:59+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  7:06AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mentioned that you play as long as 3 players show up.

Good to know. <br/><br/>The speed improvement would be in ONE player selecting ONE skill and rolling for that. Instead of everyone trying to figure out first their own help capabilities, and then helping those that still haven't figured it out how to do it.  All in all I think it would be faster, actual play will tell.<br/><br/>As for Patrol/Platoon, great idea, will not happen for this group though.<br/><br/>Jenskot: Perhaps we should look at getting back into having a COGM at times, we have played that way in the past and it has worked ok, still, that COGM would be me, and I am pretty content with just playing for now.<br/><br/>Anything involving rules is slow. But we don't want to freeform it all, there should still be a game element to the play.  We will be reducing the number of conflicts anyway.<br/><br/>3 people works better, but that is mostly because experienced gamers can do the number crunching for the newbies. It would be great if we could make it so simple that they could do their own.  Not that we mind helping, but it sort of feels like we are playing their characters for them.<br/><br/>As for balance issues, the sim-minded GM aims for a steady 50-50 chance of success, trying to predict how much help someone might get and set a target for that.  This is backwards thinking, but not much I can do about it. Still since targets are escalating everyone tries to squeeze every possible extra die out of any situation (slow). Vicious circle, but it seems to come from the fact that we allow help dice from any skill, if we correct the miss understanding it might sort itself out.<br/><br/>Jonathan: We'll try to head into dice rolling less often, and see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208753/#Comment_208753" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T14:59:53+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  2:59PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2009 3:01PM by Sean Musgrave.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite><br/><b>Helping</b><br/>You can get help from ONE other player too, that rolls ONE skill and gives the successes as bonus dice on the check.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nWhen reading this, I want to make sure that you know that by the Rules, players can only help once per test with a single die.<br/><br/>It sounds like there's a lot of pressure around the table for each player to maximize the amount of players helping - which leads to players weaseling around for ways to get help dice, which is rarely fun.

When the first three responses all say "OMG 8 people <i>really</i>?" it's probably a good idea to avoid saying things like "but that is mostly because...".

I mean, yeah, the having too many people in your group thing may be part of the reason the GM started doing that.  But it's also just really dumb.  It completely negates... well, it completely negates damn near the entire point of the engine.<br/><br/>Hell, it isn't even good Simulationism.  Is it really reasonable within the setting that every time you do something you have a 50-50 shot? Of course not, that's total fucking bullshit.  (Puts "Sim reasoning" hat on.)  In real life, I am a math teacher.  I have a much better chance of communicating a math concept to someone than I do of teaching someone, for example, a history concept, and I have a much better chance of *that* than I do of, say, repairing a car, something completely outside my area of expertise.  Right?  So a Mouse with a good Scout should be, in the fiction, more stealthy than a Mouse with a poor Scout.  (Takes off hat.)<br/><br/>And yeah, there is something you can do about it: stop playing.  If you're not willing to do that, then you're going to continue to have un-fun because *you're not playing Mouse Guard*.  And nothing anyone says in this thread is going to help you one damn bit, and neither are any of your proposed "house rules," which are all terrible if well-intentioned.  Because, in order to play Mouse Guard, you have to have a group of people\u2014and, I hate to say, but you especially need a GM\u2014who actually want to play Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209484/#Comment_209484" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T23:23:59+00:00" title="May 28, 2009 11:23PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game night yesterday and we used the house rules.<br/><br/>The game went a bit faster with the new helping rules, not very much, but a bit.

I had expected it to be a good thing in this group but it was simply great. The more quiet players got activated and started commenting on the game and stated their reasons for supporting a certain action and got really enthustiastic when someone helped them in the same way. This is definitely a keeper.<br/><br/>The GM decided to change the rule so that we will only have two chips per player, since we are rolling so few rolls these days that the balance of the game is threatened. I think I'll try to convince him to increase it to three.  After this game almost all players had three unspent chips left. But I think it would be better to have one too many than one too few, considering the effects the chips had on the metaplay.<br/><br/><b>Failure in the player turn</b><br/>Also I see a tendency of the checks in the player turn to be set upp in such a way that the players expect to fail, to get the fail checks under "safe conditions" so they can raise skills. The GM grumbled a bit about it, and I am not sure I like it either even though I do it myself. I'll have to give more thought on the matter. I can see the reason for doing so, since failure in the GM turn almost certainly cause conditions that threaten the survival of the entire party, but a failure in the player turn where the characters have split up to do their own things the horrible backlash only affects one character.  Taken to the extreme this would lead to supermice running through the GM turn with all successes followed by a slapstick player turn where everyone fails at everything.  Might not be a bad thing, I'll give it more thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/christoffer" title="christoffer"><img alt="christoffer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/christoffer">christoffer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209647/#Comment_209647" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-30T02:39:03+00:00" title="May 30, 2009  2:39AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, regarding failure in the player turn:<br/>\nPlaying any Burning game, you need failures. The burning games feeds on failures and it needs to be failures that matter. That's the GM's job. There shouldn't be such a thing as tests under safe conditions. Also, the GM needs to mix up conditions with twists.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a player you shouldn't be afraid of failure. Instead you should embrace it, when trying to build a bridge in the rain and you manage to come up with two dice against Ob6 you should go "Hell yeah! My mice is so going to get washed away, awesome!!! Anyone wanna help me out here and get washed away with me?"<br/>\n<br/>\nTo quote what Thor once said on the bw-forum "Part of getting the most out of Burning Wheel is to short-circuit that part of your gamer brain that says you must be risk-averse at all times."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
