Here's the ones that have occurred to me:<br/><br/>1. DAMAGE MAKES YOU LESS EFFECTIVE: for instance, Burning Wheel, and any other game that applies penalties as you start taking damage. It's a death-spiral, since it makes it harder to not get <i>more</i> injured, but sometimes that's what you want for genre reasons and/or gameplay dynamics (e.g. BW or The Rustbelt). Interestingly, BW does this without doing no. 3 below -- taking more hits doesn't really get you closer to suffering a mortal wound.<br/><br/>2. DAMAGE MAKES YOU MORE EFFECTIVE: like most action movies -- as the protagonist gets beat up, he gets more and more dangerous. Blood Red Sands allows you to do this, although it's not a given, since damage can take the form of traits. Sorcerer does it <i>in conjunction</i> with  no. 1 -- using the "Will trick" to overcome incapacitating damage, you can actually end up with more dice to roll than you would have if you were fine.<br/><br/>3. DAMAGE EDGES YOU TOWARDS THE POINT WHERE THE FICTION DEMANDS YOUR DEATH: hit points do this, especially if you apply the loss of hit points as something other than actual wounds and blood loss, like many OSR folks: HP loss means getting tired and sore, up until you lose those last few, and that's when it means getting a sword through your gut. The other prong ("Blood") of Rustbelt's two-pronged damage system also does this.<br/><br/>4. DAMAGE PROMPTS EVENTS OR CHOICES: Poison'd: when you suffer a deadly wound, make a bargain for your life or die. DitV: the Fallout and healing rules. 3:16: flashbacks.<br/><br/>Those are all I can think of, from the games I've had exposure to.<br/><br/>What I haven't seen: damage changing your effectiveness, without making it more or less -- that is, changing <i>categories</i> rather than (or perhaps in conjunction with) magnitude. I'm really interested in this idea. Anybody seen it anywhere?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283546/#Comment_283546" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T13:56:34+00:00" title="July 29, 2010  1:56PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess PDQ's "getting punched in the girlfriend" counts as example no.4?<br/><br/>I think D&amp;D 4E actually does something like changing your effectiveness.

They have never been in at least 25 years I think, but it's now very clear from the way the game works. Your effectiveness in the game generally remains the same until you have 1HP and you start being actually hurt when you hit zero HPs. But yeah, if you want to abstract the concept to "a resource that gets depleted by combat" it's the same more or less...<br/>\n<br/>\nGregor, though, has a point: there are some races or classes (for PCs) like the Shifters that have some features that trigger on bloodied status. In the same way some feats only activate when bloodied, or some magic objects that can be used only if bloodied (or not bloodied). Also, several monsters have bloodied effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically damage to the HPs in 4E acts both as a measure of 'staying in combat' and as a pacing mechanic: it determines when some effects in game can take place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll add another case: <i>Damage only exists as descriptive color and has no mechanical representation</i>. In Don't Rest Your Head you can be beat up pretty badly and lose conflicts and apart from describing the bad stuff that happens to you and other people around you there is nothing on the character sheet measuring damage. The only consumable resources are exhaustion and discipline, but those are not reduced by combat (not more or less than any other consequence of other kinds of conflicts, and not tied to success or failure of those).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283552/#Comment_283552" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T14:16:28+00:00" title="July 29, 2010  2:16PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite><br>I'll add another case:<em>Damage only exists as descriptive color and has no mechanical representation</em>. </br></blockquote>\nGood call.

Do I take it in "wounds?" (the player decides). If "wounds", do I take a Light Wound? A Heavy Wound? Am I Dying? (again, the player taking damage decides this, it takes a while for folks to get their brains around this). That's just the dressing. (#4)<br><br>The more damage you take (wounds), the more powerful you become. If you check the "dead box", you're generally rolling 30-50% more dice for every action you take from that point on, forever, until you decide you want to heal. "You're strong, I'll give you that. But THIS is my Final Form!" (#2)<br><br><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is the most interesting: Players basically decide if their characters die or not. Their character Will Not Die unless they check off that "Dead Box", basically saying "I'm open to the possibility of my PC's death". If they don't check off that box, they can be taken out of the fight, rolled over, taken captive, or fail to meet all their goals... but they'll stay alive.<br><br>When I got through translating those rules, back in 2006, I believe I had to change my pants.

Stats are linked to skills so you become less effective.<br/>\nAlso there are different types of damage, Wounds and stun, some weapons cause both damage types.<br/>\nStun is recovered at the end of combat. Wounds are recovered depending on location days weeks months.<br/>\nQuite a rules game but quite enjoyable and full of Dark continent goodies.<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=332" rel="nofollow">http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=332</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
