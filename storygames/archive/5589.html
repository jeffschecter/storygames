I'm actually jumping the gun by a long mile with this, at least somewhat. I'm still struggling with trying to figure out how the character creation works, and the magic system, two incredibly important parts of the game. But all the same, getting an idea of how to organize the book can't hurt. When it comes time to write it, I don't want to be making this up as I go along. <br/><br/>This is an issue I think maybe I'm insecure about.. I've obsessed about this in both of the other games I've completely written (which isn't to say they're completely done; Both are in dire need of heavy playtesting), but I think it's important. A good layout and organized structure allows for the book to be easily used as a reference during play, as well as making it easier to learn the game by presenting the information in an easily understood fashion. <br/><br/>Now, I sort of consider 4 published game systems to be the peers/siblings/competition for Mage Blade; They are D&amp;D 3.5, Vampire: the Masquerade, Shadowrun, and The Riddle of Steel. I feel this way because I've either been influenced by these games in my gaming career in some significant fashion, or because I feel that Mage Blade has a very similar target audience. So, I've looked at the tables of contents for these games that I have, and pulled out the following information. <br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/><b>D&amp;D 3.5 PHB </b><br/>Introduction <br/>Chapter 1: Abilities <br/>Chapter 2: Races <br/>Chapter 3: Classes <br/>Chapter 4: Skills <br/>Chapter 5: Feats <br/>Chapter 6: Description <br/>Chapter 7: Equipment <br/>Chapter 8: Combat <br/>Chapter 9: Adventuring <br/>Chapter 10: Magic <br/>Chapter 11: Spells <br/>Appendix: General Guidelines and Glossary <br/>Index <br/>Character Sheet <br/>List of Numbered Tables <br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/><b>The Riddle of Steel </b><br/>Book One: In the Beginning <br/>Book Two: The Birth of a Legend? <br/>Book Three: Training <br/>Book Four: The Codex of Battle <br/>Book Five: The Laws of Nature <br/>Book Six: Sorcery 101 <br/>Book Seven: The World of Weyrth <br/>Book Eight: The Seneschal <br/>Appendix One: <br/>-Damage Tables <br/>-Glossary of Game Terms <br/>-Recommended Reading/Movies <br/>-Advice from an Old Bladeslinger <br/>Appendix Two: <br/>-Combined Weapon Statistics <br/>-Afterword <br/>Index <br/>Character Sheet <br/>Map <br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/><b>Shadowrun 3rd Edition </b><br/>Introduction <br/>Welcome to the Shadows <br/>See How they Run <br/>And So it Came to Pass... <br/>Game Concepts <br/>Creating a Shadowrunner <br/>Skills <br/>Combat <br/>Vehicles and Drones <br/>Magic <br/>The Matrix <br/>Running the Shadows <br/>Beyond the Shadows <br/>Contacts <br/>Spirits and Dragons <br/>Street Gear <br/>Seattle and the Modern Northwest <br/>The Developers Say <br/>Sourcebook Updates <br/>Index <br/>Character Sheet <br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/><b>Vampire: the Dark Ages (can't find my Masquerade) </b><br/>Preface <br/>Book One: Background <br/>-Chapter One: Introduction <br/>-Chapter Two: Setting <br/>-Chapter Three: Clans <br/>Book Two: Becoming <br/>-Chapter Four: Character <br/>-Chapter Five: Disciplines <br/>-Chapter Six: Rules <br/>Book Three: Permutations <br/>-Chapter Seven: Systems <br/>-Chapter Eight: Storytelling <br/>-Chapter Nine: Antagonists <br/>Appendix <br/>-Merits and Flaws <br/>-Additional Background <br/>-Dark Ages Equipment <br/>Index <br/>Character Sheet <br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/><br/>What I need is your input on any of these books you know, in terms of organization and layout.<br/>-Is it easy to read and reference? <br/>-Does it present the information in an easily grasped way? <br/>-Aside from the organization of the chapters, what do these books do right and wrong (in terms of layout and presentation)? <br/><br/>For those books you may not be familiar with, I'm perfectly fine with impressions based just off the chapter lists here. <br/>-Does it seem laid out well? <br/>-Are things that seem like they should be grouped together separate, or things that should be separate seem lumped together? <br/><br/>Help a guy out!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125205/#Comment_125205" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T12:19:48+00:00" title="February  8, 2008 12:19PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, first, I suggest you stop saying "layout and structure" and start thinking "structure and layout."  Structure comes first, <em>way</em> first, and layout later.  You are not, by any means, thinking about structure too soon or jumping the gun.  Thinking about layout (fonts, weights of headers, spacing on the page) at this point is... not jumping the gun, but it's... daydreaming, at best.<br/><br/>Second, take a look at <a href="http://kallistipress.com/blog/2007-08-06/how-to-write-an-rpg/" rel="nofollow">How to Write an RPG</a>, a post on my blog that basically says everything that I would retype here.  It's a good idea to start thinking structure at this point -- even if you can't quite outline the whole thing yet.<br/><br/>I would caution against trying to use other books' tables of contents as a sort of 'checklist' for what you 'need' in your book.  What your book needs is determined by what your design needs, nothing else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125385/#Comment_125385" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T09:07:37+00:00" title="February  9, 2008  9:07AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, <br/><br/>Thanks for that post. It's good advice, and I'll probably take it. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I will take your caution, and ask anyway.. Is anyone willing to reply to the questions asked here? If anything, it'll be an idea of what not to do, when it comes time to organize and layout. <br/><br/>Also, for the record, when I'm thinking of layout, I'm also thinking about ease of use things, like the little chapter tabs on the edges of the D&amp;D pages, or even better the tabs on the edges of the TRoS book that tell you what game concepts are being discussed on that page. Things like which font at which size to use, spacing, etc. aren't really what I'm worried about. Things like header boxes, placement of page numbers, diagrams, charts and tables, sidebars.. All of that I'm interested in. I enjoy thinking about layout by itself, so when I'm stuck on writing or designing the actual game, I can feel that I'm making some sort of progress by working on logos, diagrams and layout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125435/#Comment_125435" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T15:21:46+00:00" title="February  9, 2008  3:21PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bachelor Roby</cite>Second, take a look at<a href="http://kallistipress.com/blog/2007-08-06/how-to-write-an-rpg/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect" target="_blank">How to Write an RPG</a>, a post on my blog that basically says everything that I would retype here.

Most of the information about your character is in there twice, first in the info dump that is the first third, then again in the character creation section that is the second third. Annoying.<br/><br/>Merits and Flaws in the back? Because designers are too wussy to make them mandatory, but too precious to keep them out.
