I was wondering what people thought about the idea, it seems pretty cool to me, albeit a bit rough. Also, it seems like developers sometimes pop in to talk about their projects around here so that would be awesome. I'm curious about the setting and stuff, but I'm more excited to see this become a virtual tabletop for mobile devices more than anything, with the included mechanics and such all included. Any thoughts or info around? I also posted to rpg.net, hoping to get some more info about this one!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/327427213/aeranos-smart-rpg-app-based-roleplaying" rel="nofollow">Aeranos kickstarter</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369220/#Comment_369220" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T08:44:54+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  8:44AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>It's pretty weird that they have this absurdly powerful platform available and they're using basically the same tired JRPG tropes - only I guess you don't actually get a story or gameplay?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369242/#Comment_369242" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T10:21:55+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 10:21AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a neat idea, but I'd much rather see such an app for a game I'm interested in than another "pseudo-celtic" fantasy world . . .<br><br>Also, their video makes their app look really clunky and slow.

I think the idea was that you don't have remember any numbers you just select from a menu tree...attack this target, with this weapon, with this feat.  The GM than sees what you did and adds this penalty plus this defense hits a button and it spits out "Critical hit to the leg for 14 damage" or whatever without anyone actually needing to know the +2s and +3s and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least that's what I got from the guy talking.  The image of the actual app...not so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, if I was going to spend that kind of time and effort to make an app that could do this...I'd do it for OGL or something that ton's of people play first.  Then I'd leverage that experience and base to roll out a version for my own game or something.  Especially if their own game is essentially D&amp;D; esque, roll initiative, roll to hit, roll damage type stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369297/#Comment_369297" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T18:06:20+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  6:06PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that was my thought as well, you'd think you'd make it for 4E or Pathfinder for all the fan boys to jump onto first. It's a cool idea though and with more time and money I'm sure they could make it sexier. From what I understood the DM and player wouldn't really have to keep track of anything - the app would do that for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the wizard would select a spell and who to cast it on and then the app would handle all the rolls and math and then let the player and GM know what happened by updating their screens or something I assume. If they got a map and grid support going it'd be pretty handy for D&amp;D; games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gamerscortex" title="gamerscortex"><img alt="gamerscortex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gamerscortex">gamerscortex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369324/#Comment_369324" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T22:30:05+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 10:30PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2012 10:37PM by gamerscortex.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there folks. This is Kevin, creator of the Aeranos App. I'd like to start out by saying thanks for taking the time to talk about the game.<br>\n<br>\nSo I'll get right into answering some of your questions, than I'll ask some of my own.<br>\n<br>\nFirst: I'd like to point out that the interface in the video is an early screen flow mockup that uses a pdf. The actual app will flow much more quickly, without the pauses and "page tun accept" buttons. We're still in the formative phases of the app. The comments did make me realize that perhaps I need to make that a lot clearer than it is in the video.<br>\n<br>\nThe idea is that combat will be a simple choice tree based on your combat skills and stats. First you choose an opponent from the GM's list of possible enemies. So if you have a longsword and a bow, and you choose weapon attack, it will show two choices: Longsword or Bow. You choose longsword and the app moves along to tell you which attacks you can make with a longsword: Basic Attack, Called Shot, Knockdown, etc. You than choose Called shot and it asks for location. You choose head and it applies the mods for a head shot. Last it gives the GM a chance to apply situational mods before comparing your attack mods to the defense mods of the enemy. You than make your roll and the app tells you if you hit or not, and if so, the wound results. That's it in a nutshell. Same basic system for non-combat skill checks only even simpler with the GM applying mods or making an opposed roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, all that said, let me talk about two thoughts I've been having. First: This whole game used to be based on OGL 3.5, and I still have that version hanging around. I've passed my system around locally and it's held up well, but I definitely get the whole "bigger audience" argument of Pathfinder. Coding for one wouldn't be much different than coding for another and your comments have given me pause... and I still have 38 days left in my project. Aaand at this point I realize it's really just one thought, not two. Should I make a fundamental system change to OGL Pathfinder and run with the Aeranos setting as my gut is starting to suggest?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know your thoughts. The lateness of the hour means I will be responding tomorrow, but I'll definitely be checking back then. Thanks ahead of time for everyone's input. And thanks again kksimons for turning me onto this forum.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. No matter the system, the app is just a number cruncher. My whole point is to speed up tabletop RPGing, not interfere in the creative aspect of collaborative story telling that's at the heart of old school role playing. The setting is detailed and the groups I've shared it with have had a lot of fun in it, but in the end it's just window dressing to the app. A playground in which to use the rules. And since you will be able to input your own custom data, there won't be anything limiting a group to a setting in the app.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, really going to bed down. Thanks again.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369325/#Comment_369325" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T22:35:50+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 10:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely do Pathfinder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369332/#Comment_369332" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T23:35:37+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 11:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gotta say, if you want this project to get support you're probably going to want to do Pathfinder. Even if the differences are slight, the fact that it would be made for Pathfinder use in mind opens it up to a way, way bigger base and applies to more people. After that succeeds there's no reason you couldn't make another app or include templates you can switch between in the app for different systems (that would be awesome).<br/>\n<br/>\nLike you said, the setting is all window dressing anyway, so, being a backer like I am, I am totally down for getting a rich setting and RPG with the app as well and more setting specific support down the road. It's an awesome idea, I'd love to see it get made. I can tell you right now though that I'm only backing at 10 bucks right now because of how it's tied to the setting (a setting I don't really know about, despite it sounding cool). Whereas if it had Pathfinder support I, and my group and many other people, would be backing it way more financially.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gamerscortex" title="gamerscortex"><img alt="gamerscortex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gamerscortex">gamerscortex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369354/#Comment_369354" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T06:12:41+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  6:12AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be having a discussion with my dev partner today about this.

I can't speak to Pathfinder specifically, but the 3.5 OGL you're probably pretty safe with and if you code the ability for people to add their own menu options they'll be able to build in themselves whatever house rules or expansions or Pathfinder specific stuff they'd want.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd once you get a framework, you'd probably be able to release versions for lots of other systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to seeing your new vid, the concept was definitely intriguing and I've tried a ton of iPad RPG apps, haven't found one that attempt what you're trying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gamerscortex" title="gamerscortex"><img alt="gamerscortex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gamerscortex">gamerscortex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369543/#Comment_369543" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T18:57:23+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  6:57PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Valamir.
