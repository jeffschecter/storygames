<a href="http://blog.kumapageworks.org/?p=73" rel="nofollow">Outside Link to the blog post.</a><br/><br/>I've had this one puddlin' around for a while - it started out as a straight two-person boardgame, with one player as a disease, playing a card-based game based on epidemiology models, and the other playing the Authorities with various resources at their disposal.<br/><br/>So now I've morphed it a bit into a survival-horror pseudo-RPG, keeping the map-based mechanics and adding in the sweet smell of desperation and coalition-building/back-stabbing mechanics.<br/><br/>Here's the Power 19 for it:
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<div><img alt="image" src="http://www.kumapageworks.org/images/pox.jpg" width="400"/></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> 1.) What is your game about?</strong></p>
<p><em>POX</em> is a survival horror game where the players not only have characters that are trying desperately to survive the cataclysm, but also can become the very thing their characters are fighting to survive.</p>
<p><strong> 2.) What do the characters do?</strong></p>
<p>The characters are everyday folks like you and me that find themselves in the middle of everyone's worst nightmare: zombie apocalypse, biological warfare, insidious alien invasion.  Their main goals are to stay alive, stay human and maybe even salvage some civilization in the process.</p>
<p><strong> 3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?</strong></p>
<p>The players have primary control over their own character, and 'stakes' in the other characters and some NPCs.  If the players happen to fail in their goals or let their humanity slip, they may become <em>The Pox</em>, and assume the role of the menace their characters are trying to escape.</p>
<p><strong> 4.) How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</strong></p>
<p>The game will be played out on a map grid (of modern cities - probably taken from Google Maps), on which the players will play map tiles.  Tile will have ratings for the things that the players need - Food, Sanctuary, Ammo and Medicine.  Each of these tiles will also have an 'Infestation' rating which denotes how bad the situation is in that place.</p>
<p><strong> 5.) How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?</strong></p>
<p>The character sheet will be framed almost entirely in negative terms - Fear, Anger, Revulsion, Panic, Last Ditch.  Positive traits are stopgaps and thresholds to the ever-increasing likelihood that the characters are worm food.  The main resource that the players have at their disposal are the relationships that they build with each other's characters as they hang onto each other.  Of course, if one of those players becomes <em>The Pox</em>, then those assets become a liability.</p>
<p><strong> 6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Pox</em> rewards coalition-building between players and a definite need for the characters to be close to one another - but at the same time creating a tension that if your character relies too much on one character or one relationship, that may be the thing that gets them killed.</p>
<p><strong> 7.) How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?</strong></p>
<p>The game swings between the need for conservative play and frenetic, headlong action.  Players must be careful not to let themselves get too complacent, and yet they can't ramrod their way through the problem, either.  The game is all about managing  and leveraging risk.</p>
<p><strong>    8.) How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?</strong></p>
<p>The actions of the protagonists is handled by the <em>Leader</em>, the player with the least levels of the main attributes - Fear, Anger and Revulsion.  The role of antagonist is performed by the current <em>Pox</em>.  Scene-framing is handled with a combination of the world map attributes, relationship rolls and consensus.  If the other players don't agree with the actions of the Leader, they can try to undermine him (make him screw up) in order to take control of the group through conflicts.  Undermine him too much, however, and the <em>Pox</em> may gain the upper hand on them all.</p>
<p><strong>      9.) What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation? (i.e. What does the game do to make them care?)</strong></p>
<p>The game accentuates conflict between players, the likelihood that their closest ally may become the <em>Pox</em>, and the give-and-take of coalition-building, <em>a la</em> <em>Survivor</em>.</p>
<p><strong>        10.) What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?</strong></p>
<p>The game uses a single d10 for all random resolution.  The <em>Pox</em> will present obstacles to the group based on a mixture of the three elements: Fear, Anger and Revulsion.  The <em>Leader</em> will respond with narration regarding the actions of the group, taking (or not) the wishes of the rest of the group into consideration.  That's about all for now ... I have it written down on a napkin somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>          11.) How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?</strong></p>
<p>The relationships of the characters to one another aid in successful resolution - however, if a character starts to slip into panic or rage, they may become a liability to the group's success and their only recourse to being narrated out to save the group will be to take over.  Also, if the Leader fails, everyone suffers, and someone might become the <em>Pox</em>.</p>
<p><strong>          12.) Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?</strong></p>
<p>Not as such.  Relationship values change, as do the primary tracks - but <em>Pox</em> is meant only to last until the characters are 'home free' or all dead/insane.</p>
<p><strong>          13.) How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</strong></p>
<p><em>Pox</em> isn't about living to a ripe old age.  It's about getting through the next five minutes without a zombie bite or ebola.</p>
<p><strong>            14.) What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?</strong></p>
<p><em>Dawn of the Dead </em>on demand.</p>
<p><strong>            15.) What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?</strong></p>
<p>The worsening condition of the characters and the setting, to drive the players to find someplace safe.  The interpersonal conflicts.  The role of the <em>Pox.  </em>Because consensus sucks and interplayer conflict is underrated. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p>
<p><strong>            16.) Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in? Why?</strong></p>
<p>The map-tile mechanics and the role of the <em>Pox</em>.  I'm interested in new gameforms that take bits and pieces from boardgames and other forms and incorporate them into RPGs.</p>
<p><strong>            17.) Where does your game take the players that other games canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, or wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t?</strong></p>
<p>Good question ...</p>
<p><strong>            18.) What are your publishing goals for your game?</strong></p>
<p>PDF published, with supplemental material covering different poxes.</p>
<p><strong>            19.) Who is your target audience?</strong></p>
<p>Zombie enthusiasts, groups looking for a short-term game to play, boardgame players looking to deepen their play.</p> </div>

                            I have to tell you that I wrote up all of this before seeing your 24hr RPG ... I had a mini-coronary when I saw your title.  But after reading it, I think we also have very diverse tacks on the same concept.<br/><br/>Good to see another RomZom in the world, though. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<code>Apocalypse is very fashionable this year.</code><br/><br/>No kidding.  Sometimes I think there's only one or two Muses dedicated to each type of indeavour, and I start imagining them getting caught up in paperwork or trying to leave the office early on the days I apply for inspiration.                        </div>

Crazy fun stuff, all of it.  I think that all the Apocalyptic games I've noted thus far are pretty impressively different, though.  So, that's cool.                        </div>

RE: #7- Your answer tells us nothing about how actions are rewarded and/or punished in your game.  It might help by looking at the question from a Ã¢â‚¬Å“What do the characters and players get (advancement, currency, resources) for what they do in-game?Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/>

RE: #9-  Your answer here makes it sound like most of the action and contention will be among the players with the Pox staying in the background as occasional tension builders.

RE: #10- Ã¢â‚¬Å“taking the groups concerns into considerationÃ¢â‚¬Â- how do your mechanics hold the leader accountable in this?  Does he get a bonus for doing what other people say?  Or is it up to him and only him what the group does?<br/>

#7: Players improve their relationships (or change their relationships, depending) based on their interactions with each other during 'down-times'.  When interacting with the map, if characters reach desinations (a hospital, for example), they can scrounge for resource (medicine, shelter).  These things then can be used to repair their Fear, Anger and Revulsion meters.  I'm also thinking of adding an Exhaustion meter.  By defeating outbreaks of the Pox (when zombies storm their haven, for example), the characters gain currency towards improving their attributes, or to paying-down permanent Fear, Anger or Revulsion.<br/><br/>#8: I've been thinking about the Leader thing today, and I may scrap it, allowing the leadership of the group to be a contested element based on relationships.  I'm not sure which way will work better right now.<br/><br/>#9: Inter-personal conflict between the players/characters is one of the main triggers of the Pox.  They're inter-related.  If the characters disagree with each other and their hand is forced, it raises Anger, which if a roll is failed may turn into Rage, which is a trigger for the Pox.<br/><br/>#10: Again, I might drop the whole Leader thing.  It seems like I'm taking the piss out of leadership if I model it that way.<br/><br/>#15: Each character has goals - 'finding my wife and kids', which need to be fulfilled.  The longer they go unfulfilled, the worse the character's condition gets (Fear, most likely).  By accomplishing a goal, they can improve their condition greatly with a boatload of currency.  New goals ('making sure Alan lives through this') can be created using currency in order to create 'waypoints' for the character.  (Reading over TSoY again, these'd be 'Keys'.)                        </div>
