When we stumble on an obstacle and no one wants or no one can cross out his/her trait we\u2019ve got to change the CD. That\u2019s clear.

Do we play the first one again starting from the point it was stopped last time? That would seem reasonable but maybe there are some other rules I\u2019ve overlooked.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd by the way, a friend of mine asked me today whether it is ok to use just a soundtrack let\u2019s say from a cool road movie instead of picking separate songs from different sources when compiling a CD? Again, to me it seems ok, but a bit lame so I just would like to know what\u2019s your opinion.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293537/#Comment_293537" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T16:38:30+00:00" title="September 15, 2010  4:38PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ina</cite>There is just one question I can\u2019t find the answer for in the booklet.

Karina, your friend is being given an sort of rare opportunity. The entire group is going to create art out of their favourite music. That's cool!<br/>I'd definitely try to push said friend a little bit. Making a 40-minute mix isn't hard, and no one's expecting these mixes to be earth-shatteringly good.<br/><br/>Making a mix is part of how you buy in, emotionally. It's a step that can be skipped, and using a soundtrack from a movie is just fine, but it's not ideal.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>I'd think it would be okay to use a soundtrack, but it's likely to be far less personal.

That might be a better choice, if you guys like the bands on the CD, as a movie soundtrack does carry with it a bunch of external expectations.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ina</cite>There is just one question I can\u2019t find the answer for in the booklet.

Go back to a previous CD. If one didn't get lots of playtime (because of a Detour), that one might be the best one to return to. Otherwise, just return to the first one used. Start where you left off, or if you can't remember where you left off, start at the beginning.<br/><br/>I just want to note, also, in regards to Obstacles: you don't need Obstacles in every scene. I usually encounter 1-5 Obstacles across an entire game of Ribbon Drive. The games with 1-2 Obstacles are very much slow personal dramas. The games with 3-5 Obstacles are a bit more punctuated and upbeat. The games with more than 5 Obstacles tend to be zany and off-the-wall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ina" title="Ina"><img alt="Ina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ina">Ina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293727/#Comment_293727" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T05:46:51+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  5:46AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for the answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for using a movie soundtrack or a full CD here is not laziness but rather something like \u201cOh my! It\u2019s so awesome <i>as a whole</i>, because it creates the <i>story</i>, that I want to make you listen to it now and experience something similar!\u201d. But indeed, that makes the game far less personal, I agree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe CD included is great, I really like it and I\u2019d love to use it anyway! Plus, I thought this could be very useful when running the game at the convention when no one has a soundtrack prepared.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
