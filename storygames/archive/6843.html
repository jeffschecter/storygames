More specifically, I want to play the damned thing as a prelude to <i>hacking</i> the damned thing, because I see so much hackability there. Everything from replacing the movement grid with abstract SotC-style Zones to tossing out all the classes and powers and using the "Actions the Rules Don't Cover" section of the DMG as the basis for a rules-lite monster whacking game. But I don't want to fall into the old habit of endlessly making up houserules to compensate for not actually getting to play the game. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the area where I live isn't exactly a hotbed of roleplaying culture. Although if someone made a "Eating Crawfish and Watching College Sports: the RPG", it would sell like hotcakes down here. <i>Crawfish</i> hotcakes. And even if I did find a gaming group, there's the issue of my odd hours and unpredictable days off to contend with.<br/><br/>This is me venting.
