If it just seems a waste of time, don't post and I'll take a lack of responces as disagreement. I tend to take it that when someone posts, they found some small use for it and I post back. If the other person finds no use at all and still posts - well, we end up posting back and forth forever, because I mistakenly think you find some small use for it, but we just haven't figured what it is yet and are working on it by posting.<br/><br/><br/>Onto the actual post. I was thinking about this\n<blockquote>If you use maneuvers that are lame-o cheesemonkey in our book, you went outside the defined borders of the challenge.</blockquote>\nI was thinking, if you set borders of a challenge by personal aesthetics, where is that boader at any given point in time?<br/><br/>For example, lets say you can use a number of magic points at once to do blasts - the more points, the more damage.<br/><br/>Now, you play for about fifteen hours before a situation comes up where you find 200 points of magic expended at once is  lame-o. That'd mean the boarder is either 200 or perhaps somewhere earlier. The boarders certainly been crossed at 200 points. Let's say 200 is the boarder.<br/><br/>If you didn't know 200 would be lame-o until having experienced it happen (after many hours of play), was the boader actually defined at being 200 points from the very first time you played the game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155144/#Comment_155144" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T20:20:57+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  8:20PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, <br/>\n<br/>\nin fact the boarder may not be 200 in your example either<br/>\n<br/>\nall we know is that 200 is over the boarder, and we have some other number that is not<br/>\n<br/>\nthis may be a problem in your example moreso. I really don't think the boarder is seriously shifting (ie that one day it will be lameo to spend 200 points and the next day[week, month]  it will be okay, with the priviso that yeah things change sometimes). <br/>\n<br/>\nmoreso , it may not even be lameo the first time you cross it. I think lots of social gentlemen's aggreements are open to interpretation and or change. For example , when we played crack:the gathering at school, we didn't play with "mana hosers" ie cards that exceptionally hosed a particular colour" I started playing and stayed away from the "banned cards" yet still played with a card that was eventually added to the list. Eventually the list changed (grew, the card was added threw family resemblence )and i took the card out, but for a while i was playing with a mana hoser, AND PEOPLE WERE LETTING ME against the gentleman's agreement. Does that mean the gentleman's agreement was never definied or decided upo? I think not, the being or lack of a clear line doesn't make the point i think<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway ymmv<br/>\n<br/>\nLogos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155147/#Comment_155147" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T20:39:32+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  8:39PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan,<br/><br/>This is the same issue as certain in-game actions and narrations earning the "gonzo" tag. What is gonzo to some players will be perfectly in-keeping-with-genre-expectations for someone else.<br/><br/>If you narrate swinging from a chandelier, and we all nod in approval that your character would indeed do that in our swashbuckling game... then awesome. I step it up by doing a backflip off a wall, landing on my enemy combatant's head. Everyone gives me this rolling-eyes stare and no one congratulates my creative narration.<br/><br/>Damn it.<br/><br/>I thought... swinging on chandelier was a little zany, so is the backflip move. I blew the border, as you put it.<br/><br/>There are two issues going on here:<br/><br/>1.) We have different limits<br/>2.) We are operating on different convention expectations.<br/><br/>Either I went "too far", or I went in the "wrong direction". Possibly both. The border isn't necessarily in one direction. It is in all directions surrounding the SIS. It extends further in one (or more) direction, and that's because we're stretching it to accomodate genre expectations.<br/><br/>How do you know where the borders are? Partially by talking about conventions before play. Partially by reading people.<br/><br/>Largely by incrementally testing them, against different directions, to find comfort zones. Did you save up 100 points and blow them all at once? Did people get behind that, or shy away? Did you save up 150 points and blow them all at once? Did people like that magic, or did they avert eyes?<br/><br/>Likely, borders expand with time, because trust is gained. When we start play, the border is really 0. Until I believe that your intent is to play a fun game, I won't be ready to accept ANY point expenditure. Then as we start to play, I'll be comfortable with being hit by a 25 point fireball. And as I grow to trust you more, and we explore our borders mutually and with ongoing expansion, it's possible that I'll be comfortable with 200 point fireballs hitting my mage.<br/><br/>There's a reason that the tried-n-try D&amp;D campaign is rags to riches. People feel awkward with their peers narrating glorious kings and lord-emperors slaying dragons in a single sword stroke. They aren't willing to lend that credibility at the start of the game. So we have to start earlier than that, and reach and push those borders gradually.

There was an agreement on banned cards<br/>2. You played with a card which was NOT on that list, but was a good mana hoser<br/>3. Latter on that card was <i>added </i>to the banned list of cards<br/>4. Immediately upon it being added to the list, you ceased using that card any further<br/><br/>I totally accept that sequence of events as valid...but the way your trying to describe it is really unusual.\n<blockquote>Eventually the list changed (grew, the card was added threw family resemblence )and i took the card out, but for a while i was playing with a mana hoser, AND PEOPLE WERE LETTING ME against the gentleman's agreement</blockquote>\nThe gentlemans agreement changed at step three, didn't it? Why are you saying people were LETTING you go against the gentlemans agreement, when you were following the agreement exactly? And then when the agreement was changed, you followed the new version perfectly.<br/><br/>Have I missread the sequence of events? I just don't see you going against the gentlemans agreement at all. In terms of the thread topic, you example has a fixed boarder (banned card list), then everyone agrees to move the boarder to another explicitly stated spot (banned card list gets a specific card added to it), and you go along with it. I'm not seeing any ambiguity or anything about the situation (which I think is great, but I think you were trying to say the boarder was blurred. Or did I missread?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155158/#Comment_155158" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T22:54:16+00:00" title="July  6, 2008 10:54PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2008 10:54PM by Callan_S.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Joe,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>How do you know where the borders are?

But I'm inclined to think that that process could become the point of play itself.<br/><br/>I'll just paraphrase quote Ron Edwards a bit here\n<blockquote>However, in play, there must be an ongoing, reinforced agreement about a set of information that cannot be threatened. This is our shared understanding of what we bring into the imagined events of play, and it must be seen as a complete package - not only the five components of Exploration, but also any thematic or other emergent content.<br/><br/>A great deal of the aesthetic power, as I see it (and I mean that literally), lies in (a) adding to or developing that package, and (b) enjoying its resiliency against potential violation. At its least extreme, this is pure emulation. At its most extreme, it is parody. In between, you get modifications like "Lovecraft on a starship" or "steampunk fantasy" and so on. In each case, the goals are just as I've stated with (a) and (b). </blockquote>\nI've skipped some parts of that quote, just for now - I'll give its link latter on.<br/><br/>Anyway, Ron is describing a process which constitutes the point of playing (in a particular agenda). It sounds relatively simple in a way, and working out where everyones boarders are and as you noted, expanding on those boarders as trust is gained, sounds simple too.<br/><br/>With what you described, do you think that could end up being the <b>big thing</b> that gameplay is about? A game about setting up boarders and sometimes stretching them (rather than really playing within those boarders, like you do in chess)?<br/><br/>I'll be honest - I'm trying to draw a distinction between gamism and gameplay where boarders are constantly negotiated. Not to belittle either of them, just to distinguish them apart from each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155161/#Comment_155161" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T23:04:15+00:00" title="July  6, 2008 11:04PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan,<br/><br/>I recently played Breaking The Ice and I think that expanding upon the borders is a huge part of gameplay in that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155195/#Comment_155195" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T08:10:11+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  8:10AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2008 8:11AM by Valamir.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, this is actually why I really like games with mechanical "border setting rules" that can be accessed in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand well the importance of borders and staying within them.  I just have zero desire to read a 5000 manuscript detailing every possible permutation of where that border is, nor do I enjoy extensive "line and veil" discussions pre play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to establish those borders dynamically during play:  its easier, it allows for greater creative potential, its more convenient, faster to start playing, and because sometimes pushing borders is really interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time Joe's nodding vs. eyerolling is sufficient to establish precedent...say that covers 80% of all border setting needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSOMETIMES, it doesn't.  That can be because someone disagrees that an action was eye-roll worthy, or because sometimes something tactically important is at stake and depends on where that border is.  On those occassions (say the other 20%) its quite useful (and functional) to have a formal "border check" mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nDogs has the rule which instructs players to abide by the aesthetic of the most critical person at the table.<br/>\nUniversalis has the Challenge mechanic which allows players to bid resources for the right to set the border where they want it.<br/>\nSome games give specific veto power over specific aspects to specific players and make those players the "border patrol" for their area of responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of ways to do it.  But doing it in some fashion (preferably one that fits the game) is IMO essential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155254/#Comment_155254" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T13:31:37+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  1:31PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Valamir,<br><br>I now want games to ahve a designated "border patrol" person at the table.
