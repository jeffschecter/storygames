These are places where the heroes live and have adventures, away from the authorities based in towns and cities.<br/><br/>In an SF milieu the technology behind space travel makes this concept rather difficult. How does such a place exist in the physical world (as is my intention, rather than some philosophical or even cyberpunk setting - like the matrix) when you can travel around the galaxy in starships? What is it that would stop the galactic authority (in this case the Empire) from flying into Jianghu space and claiming it for itself?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443558/#Comment_443558" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T18:27:21+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  6:27PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Manpower.

The oldest of all are of course sub-lightspeed (essentially stationary to modern eye) arcologies and cryosleep ships, but the story doesn't end there.<br/><br/>The Empire exists wherever the dragon gates are built and maintained, but that cannot occur everywhere: it is expensive and requires certain conditions, such as stars of the correct type, and the correct feng shui (or local gravitic field, or the cosmic river flow). Dragon gates occur where important worlds are and where the cosmic river flows; what worlds are serviced by gates become great from the Emperor's touch.<br/><br/>In the meantime the Jianghu is served by lesser forms of interstellar travel, all inferior to the dragon gates, and virtually unknown in imperial space except in the use of the soldiers and such men who by necessity have to step beyond the facile ways.<br/><br/>An example of a Jianghu space ship engine might involve a great mirrorshade globe growing like a lotus flower around a space ship as it nears the local sun, the shade reflecting away radiation and slowly collecting neutrons in its funnel. The ship plummets into the sun over a period of days or even weeks, twirling to gather neutrons into its neutron trap as the occupants sweat and wait; they know that neutrons cannot be stored long, and thus they have to be collected from a major outflow provided by a star, quickly, to gather a sufficient amount; they know that it is too late to turn back, as the ship no longer has the power to escape the gravitic pull of the merciless inferno; if all goes well, the ship's neutron warp latches and the ship launches off through the star itself, crossing interstellar space in an instant and arriving near any other star within a certain radius dependent upon the neutron fuel and the size of the warp latch. <b>The mirrorshade lotus engine</b> is relatively cheap, it can go anywhere there is a star, and while it is true that using it shortens your lifespan due to the radiation exposure, it is always worth it for those willing to suffer the indignity and waiting involved in this method of travel.<br/><br/>Perhaps there are many such methods of interstellar travel, different engine plans with their own advantages and disadvantages. People who desire the stars in the Jianghu spaces, who want to connect to the Empire or other Jianghu worlds, will be willing to use these as a matter of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443598/#Comment_443598" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T12:56:34+00:00" title="March  3, 2015 12:56PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's nice, but i think it's a bit too convoluted.

Like the outlaw regions in Firefly.  Something perhaps more ideological than physical ironically.<br/><br/>The more convoluted the method of space travel, the harder to sell. I would prefer something like Star Wars where hyperspace (which of course is not explained and is just a handwave for travelling between plot devices) can let someone fly from anywhere to anywhere. You can land on a planet, take off and fly to the edge of the galaxy and land. It's the ultimate convenience.

If you've ever played a decent space 4X game on your PC, you know that for various reasons, some star systems are just not worth bothering with.   And this would be EXTRA true in a "realistic" galaxy with 300 BILLION star systems in our galaxy alone.   There is plenty of room for whole stretches of "No planets worth colonizing and no interesting natural resources" combined with "Just long enough travel time away from a major hub (or even the next star system) to be annoying to get to."<br/><br/>That said, if you INSIST on having basically instant travel, this idea breaks down - unless travel is completely untraceable.  In which case, once again, it comes down to manpower. The galaxy is F-ing huge, and there's no way to police it all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443616/#Comment_443616" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T18:40:45+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  6:40PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I suppose that's reasonable!<br/><br/>The instant travel idea is what I would have preferred simply because it allows the heroes more flexibility to travel and have adventures - and space battles - rather than impose restrictions that hamper al that good stuff.<br/><br/>A system of gates might work though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443619/#Comment_443619" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T19:36:23+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  7:36PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2015 7:36PM by Airk.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Certainly some sort of Gate or Node or Wormhole or whatever travel (where you can go from point A to point B VERY FAST, but don't necessarily get to go directly from point A to point C at all) opens up a lot of options and is pretty standard sci-fi stuff.<br/><br/>Also, adding even a LITTLE bit of travel time ("It takes a week to complete a jump") adds back the sense of distance that allowed ancient China and the like to have "wilderness".                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443628/#Comment_443628" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T21:59:50+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  9:59PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I need something that's the best of both worlds: established transit routes but also with a wilderness to be explored.

In that case it probably isn't suited to your needs. <br/><br/>If you are worried about that in general, one thing I would advise based on my experience running and play testing my own wuxia system (just what I have learned from observing players who have minimal grounding in the genre) is make the way powers work somewhat explicit in the book (even if it is just in a sidebar). I discovered one of the reasons people get turned off to wuxia is they think stuff like leaping over roofs and flowing Chi into someone's body to heal them are arbitrary things chosen for stylistic or plot reasons alone. Once they realize there is a kind of physics to the genre (and of course your physics may vary for the setting you are making) it really helps them understand it a lot more and they accept what the characters can do as being real. That is at least my experience.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443751/#Comment_443751" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T22:31:00+00:00" title="March  5, 2015 10:31PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, though most people are appeased by the high flying kung fu in my experience <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I'm thinking having two methods: a system of Gates within imperial space, controlling movement and allowing for a vibrant spaceport element, and, in jianghu space (which is probably best as a singular - frontier style - region, where there are no gates, one must rely on shared data and an ability to pilot.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443752/#Comment_443752" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T22:51:45+00:00" title="March  5, 2015 10:51PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I agree, though most people are appeased by the high flying kung fu in my experience <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>. </blockquote>\nWhat I find is those who may be inclined to dismiss wuxia as silly or too over the top, will be more willing to give it a shot once they know there are some principles underlying the powers. I think it just gives them the sense that it is grounded in something. For example I know lots of people who love star wars, but have a hostility toward martial arts movies with flashy powers if you first introduce them to wuxia or similar genres. Star Wars is not that far from wuxia. And I think the reason people accept it (beyond it being designed for an American audience) is that the ground rules are clearly understood by viewers. They know that powers come from the force and that there are consistent things it can be used for. A lot of people I introduce wuxia to feel overwhelmed because they don't understand the ground rules. It of course depends on who you are dealing with.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443766/#Comment_443766" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-06T10:59:12+00:00" title="March  6, 2015 10:59AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This project is wuxia in a broad sense. But it's not about the mechanics or science of Chi. In the way Feng Shui abstracts all that stuff (as opposed to Legends of the Wulin which wholly uses the ancient systems of five element theory as actual mechanics) I intend to do something similar. Also the powers/abilities aren't simply applications of Chi in the way kungfu (wushu) moves are. It is there to represent how much of the cool stuff a hero can do, but not directly requiring it in the same way 'Shaolin Mighty Fist' works. This setting is intended to be its own thing and not China In Space. For that reason I keep the use of Chinese terminology to a minimum and make use of anglicised versions which, elsewhere, would be wholly ignorant. So, in Storm Riders, the English readers know the main protagonists as Wind and Cloud, not as their Chinese names (or even the Chinese words for wind and cloud). That is the sensibility here. So its wuxia in the sense of heroic chivalry outlaw warrior renegades, but not as much in the sense of a simulation of the mechanics of Chi energy or Taoist cosmology.<br/><br/>That said, this thread has morphed into a discussion more of how travel works. Which is fine. This question throws up one of the difficulties I have working on this: that a given setting element (eg space travel and how it's done) needs to be expressed in keeping with this theme. This of coruse can be done any number of ways, as has been suggested. All of those ideas are entirely valid, but for me it needs to be something simple if not obvious. By obvious I mean in keeping with the source material in a way that is what you would expect it to be: for example, Jedi in SW are, as has been suggested, based on wuxia/eastern lore and instead of swords they use laser swords - lightsabres - because thats the obvious sci fi representation of a sword hero with mystical powers. <br/><br/>If you see what I mean!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443769/#Comment_443769" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-06T14:49:01+00:00" title="March  6, 2015  2:49PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Manpower is the simple/standard answer. <br/><br/>If you want something cool, call it....THE CURSE.<br/><br/>Anyone who goes out there ends up going a little bit crazy.<br/><br/>Same reason Pandora is filled with ravening psychos in Borderlands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443776/#Comment_443776" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-06T20:12:39+00:00" title="March  6, 2015  8:12PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm feeling Daoism should merge with space travel in some 'obvious' way, but i'm not seeing it.<br/><br/>I keep thinking that space piloting should be accompanied by some unique suite of abilities but then that leads to a situation where such people have too much power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443777/#Comment_443777" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-06T20:20:25+00:00" title="March  6, 2015  8:20PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you could do there is have pilots who are in sync with your equivalent of the Dao, be a not have to rely on certain technologies.

This device uses hyper-dimensional equations to cross between normal and Tao Space. This is Wu Wei Mathematics, created by the Immortals as the language of creation. Tao Shamans study relatively primitive levels of Wu Wei Mathematics (compared to the Immortals) using Chi. They are always searching for evidence of higher level mathematics in secret places left by the Immortals as yet untouched.<br/>A Tao Engine balances two sources of energy: Yin and Yang Matter. The former is derived from the cold depths of space while the latter burns in the heart of stars. Ships are equipped with Taiji Sails, designed to collect these resources directly: Yang matter is absorbed in the orbit of a sun, while Yin matter is absorbed in Dark regions - unfortunately such regions have also been corrupted turning Yin matter into the Evil Soul, worshipped by Dark Celestials. This state is the product of conflict and war throughout the history of the 10,000 Stars.<br/>Crews in Jianghu Space commonly eschew shipboard AI systems (particularly those sourced from the Empire). Out here a Tao Shaman is a better substitute, able to calculate more intuitively than the limited set of Wu Wei formulae possessed by an August Intellect.

The oldest of all are of course sub-lightspeed (essentially stationary to modern eye) arcologies and cryosleep ships, but the story doesn't end there.<br/><br/>The Empire exists wherever the dragon gates are built and maintained, but that cannot occur everywhere: it is expensive and requires certain conditions, such as stars of the correct type, and the correct feng shui (or local gravitic field, or the cosmic river flow). Dragon gates occur where important worlds are and where the cosmic river flows; what worlds are serviced by gates become great from the Emperor's touch.<br/><br/>In the meantime the Jianghu is served by lesser forms of interstellar travel, all inferior to the dragon gates, and virtually unknown in imperial space except in the use of the soldiers and such men who by necessity have to step beyond the facile ways.<br/><br/>An example of a Jianghu space ship engine might involve a great mirrorshade globe growing like a lotus flower around a space ship as it nears the local sun, the shade reflecting away radiation and slowly collecting neutrons in its funnel. The ship plummets into the sun over a period of days or even weeks, twirling to gather neutrons into its neutron trap as the occupants sweat and wait; they know that neutrons cannot be stored long, and thus they have to be collected from a major outflow provided by a star, quickly, to gather a sufficient amount; they know that it is too late to turn back, as the ship no longer has the power to escape the gravitic pull of the merciless inferno; if all goes well, the ship's neutron warp latches and the ship launches off through the star itself, crossing interstellar space in an instant and arriving near any other star within a certain radius dependent upon the neutron fuel and the size of the warp latch. <b>The mirrorshade lotus engine</b> is relatively cheap, it can go anywhere there is a star, and while it is true that using it shortens your lifespan due to the radiation exposure, it is always worth it for those willing to suffer the indignity and waiting involved in this method of travel.<br/><br/>Perhaps there are many such methods of interstellar travel, different engine plans with their own advantages and disadvantages. People who desire the stars in the Jianghu spaces, who want to connect to the Empire or other Jianghu worlds, will be willing to use these as a matter of course.</blockquote>\nThis is wonderful stuff.

I am normally very relaxed about what people post on forums (unlike, it seems, 99% of rpg sites online, sadly), but if I had any say I'd ban people like this. Trying to shit stir is a pretty disgraceful way to behave and that's what has been done. I responded to that contribution with two bloody paragraphs of text and I'll be damned if someone is going to tell me, having made no contribution to this discussion of their own either, I'm in the wrong.

Let's not assume the worst about each other, though! Ian was surely just taken back by the same phenomenon we've seen before on this forum, when people assume that you're being hostile when you're merely being terse. Others have remarked upon this before, how your communication style makes it seem like you disregard and belittle other people's ideas in these brainstorming threads.<br/><br/>Please Ian, I would consider it a favour if you chose to take Whistler's rebuttal in good grace here. No true harm has been done and no honor slighted. We have something of a history at this point with Whistler, talking about his game here, throwing out ideas, and I can take care of myself - I participate voluntarily, not expecting him to jump to implement my ideas, but rather in the hopes of helping him hone his own vision by showing off alternatives and such. I freely admit that he has a pretty pointy discussion style, but I no more suspect him of intentional snubbing than I suspect you of shit-stirring; the sentiment is admirable, but you really can't interfere in how another person's creative process works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443976/#Comment_443976" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T15:53:35+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  3:53PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have explained my reasoning.

Typically, smaller ships rely on passage aboard a carrier or a Gate; they do not have the capacity for a Dao Engine. (A Dao Engine is hyperdrive, basically - a Gate is just a jump gate)<br/><br/>The River is a construct: its existence depends on the power of mortals, specifically the Dragon Monks contemplating the hyper-mathematical equations underpinning the River. These equations are called Wu Wei Mathematics.<br/><br/>So what is a Dragon Monk? Some kind of being - your typical chanting/Buddhist/eastern monk - whose Chi powered contemplation of super-powered maths creates hyperspace, basically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
