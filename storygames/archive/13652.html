To speculate, though: I'd say it's because there's time. A multi-session game has time to spread out and wander, if everyone's still engaged (I'm not defending downtime or aimless play). Although I have found that I pick up the tempo when engaging more complex systems (we're playing BW). I guess it's because (a) a +1Ob or +1D missed here or there over the course of a Duel of Wits or Fight has a minimal impact on the outcome or narrative, and (b) years of Champions play has made me adverse to three-hour-long combats "simulating" about five minutes of activity. Ugh.<br/><br/>Speaking to what we play more--big board games like Decent--I try to keep a brisk pace just because some scenarios can run out to 6 or 8 hours, if folks dick around too much. I don't have that kind of time, usually.

Having "more time" is no excuse for not having more fun, or is it? I wonder if this has to do with our traditional way of playing the games? I've done a lot of development in tools and play-styles myself, both in modern and classical role-playing games, but my old rpg-group have never shared in my developments. They are too set in their ways for me to even bother trying. I suspect that this is true for most groups out there ...<br/><br/>Why? Maybe due to the fact that creating a conscious rhythm in the game needs some authoritative leadership to work (at least in classical rpgs). That kind of leadership is not supported in most classical games (in spite of the use of a "game master"), and are indeed virtually impossible with the slow and cumbersome resolution systems in most of these games. <br/><br/>And then it is frowned upon in most player-groups too. The players don't want to be "bullied" around, and any leadership interfering with the pace of their game-play is hard to accept as positive by players with such a mindset. I suspect that the vague idea of <i>an egalitarian group-structure</i> makes it hard to work with rhythmic tools in classical games.<br/><br/>In more recent <b>classical games</b> the trend is more mixed, in my view. It may be that <i>Dogs in The Vineyard</i> is a step forward regarding tempo (if not rhythm). I don't know it enough to say for sure. <i>3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars</i> certainly is a step forward, in tempo, and creates some wonderfully intense game-play as a consequence. <i>Burning Wheel</i> and its offspring is a step back, in this respect, as I see it.<br/><br/>As for <b>modern games</b> I do not know. Most of them seems to materialize the egalitarian group-structure we've dreamed of, by getting rid of the GM (and creating equally shared tools for influencing the game-play), and as such I would expect them to be as bad on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rhythm</span> as the classical games. But I would love to see some evidence to the contrary. In my view tools on rhythm would be the next big step forward, in fulfilling the potential of modern role-playing games. Players of modern games should be made equally able to "bully" each other into more intense game-play! ;-)<br/><br/>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tempo</span>, though, I find modern games to be much bolder than the classical ones. Most of them are played at a much higher tempo. I believe the higher tempo of modern games is much of the reason many of them feels more intense and entertaining. The higher tempo is a key to their success, in my view. The curious thing is that <i>tempo</i> has still not been much discussed in relation to them. Why is that?<br/><br/><i>(my terms "classical" and "modern" pertains only to the presence of a GM, or not. Classical games got a singular GM. Modern games are organized and led in other ways)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308881/#Comment_308881" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T17:02:37+00:00" title="January 20, 2011  5:02PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2011 5:09PM by johnzo.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>I'd be interested in some mechanics for tempo &amp; rhythm in GM-less games...anything fit the bill?</blockquote>\nFiasco (truly GMless) and Montsegur (rotating GMish authority) both have hard limits on the number of scenes that will be played in a game.  I don't know if these limits are precisely tempo mechanics, but they can definitely inform tempo.<br/><br/>Combined I've played these games at cons ~6 times.   Both games always fit nicely in a ~4hr con slot, and both games always produced crammed and satisfyingly eventful narratives.<br/><br/>Usually this happens without my intervention, but when I'm facilitating one of those games, I do try keep an eye on the clock, and I'll periodically divide the number of scenes remaining by the available time, so that I know if we need to crack the whip or not.<br/><br/>I wonder if formally imposing a time limit on the game might be a good tempo mechanic?   In GPNW08's Heart of Darkness game, we meandered chaotically for three hours and then, when we discovered we had ~20 minutes to be done and be out of the hotel, we fused our brains and arrived at an unexpected burning-hot ending that wrapped up the story of every character in a deeply satisfying way.  <br/><br/>Rhythm management, for me, has exclusively been in the realm of technique rather than mechanics, so that's a tougher question to answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308882/#Comment_308882" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T17:12:48+00:00" title="January 20, 2011  5:12PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2011 5:13PM by johnzo.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>The curious thing is that<i>tempo</i>has still not been much discussed in relation to them.

Speeding things up is considered a virtue in those discussions. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>I wonder if formally imposing a time limit on the game might be a good tempo mechanic?</blockquote>I started my classical game <i>Fabula</i> out as a tool for GMing children, in 2 hour slots after school (back in 1995). Due to the time-frame I had to design a game with simple mechanics, to facilitate high-speed interaction. This proved to be very effective in other ways too, as it empowered the GM in ways I had not foreseen. As the years went by, and the game developed (I led it professionally from 1995, published it in 1999, and I am still on it), I continued to work mainly within this time-frame. So much of what I'm saying on tempo originated in my experiences with such an imposed time limit.<br/><br/>The time frame has had other consequences too. The fast flowing mechanics supports shifts in tempo, including going into the slow "reflective pace", and this flexibility has facilitated the development of some sophisticated storytelling techniques.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Rhythm management, for me, has exclusively been in the realm of technique rather than mechanics, so that's a tougher question to answer.</blockquote>My design-principles includes a simple divide of <b>the game method</b> into <span style="text-decoration: underline;">resolution/task-system</span> (mechanics) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">storytelling techniques</span>. The techniques are mainly focused on how to lead a group of players through engaging drama, and how to accentuate their individual part in that drama. During the years I have come to lean more and more on <i>rhythm</i> for this, shifting the pace according to the situation, demanding players to gear up and gear down their pace of interaction in tune with developments in the drama.<br/><br/>Mainly this has been:<br/><b>- gearing up tempo in conflicts<br/>- gearing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">down</span> tempo in reflective scenes</b><br/> Nowadays it also includes:<br/><b>- gearing up tempo in towns, castles and cities<br/>- gearing up tempo when the characters attends a party or celebration<br/>- gearing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">down</span> tempo in any aftermath-scene pertaining to a conflict, city or celebration (this is reflective, of course)</b><br/><br/><i>In general I'm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gearing up</span> whenever the characters dive into a chaotic and densely populated social setting.</i><br/><br/>The relatively simple shiftings between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">high-action scenes</span> and the calmer <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reflective scenes</span>, does much to support in-depth character-interpretation, and is wonderfully effective in building and releasing dramatic tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308894/#Comment_308894" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T22:33:52+00:00" title="January 20, 2011 10:33PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2011 10:37PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My up-tempo play-mode for cities, conflicts and celebrations is strictly turn-based (each player will be focus for at least one scene, or gets to frame a scene, each turn). The scenes are often played out in seconds (in a major battle a typical scene may last for 3-7 seconds). The point is to run through <i>lots of scenes</i>, to simulate the chaos of human interaction in situations with a lot happening at the same time. Most scenes are dealt with outside the resolution system (although the res-system in Fabula is fast).<br/><br/>The "audience time" in this play-mode is so short no one have any reason to leave the table.<br/>- And this is important: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all players present makes all players part-take</span> in the full effect of the play-mode; <i>the whole group</i> experience the chaotic nature of the situation.

Even though the mode allows for a lot of characters going their own ways, the players still create <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a shared story</span> out of it. <br/><br/>I find this play-mode to be easy to do, effective, popular amongst the players, and great fun for the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308895/#Comment_308895" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T22:40:24+00:00" title="January 20, 2011 10:40PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actual play, up-tempo mode, barn-party (reposted from the "downtime"-thread):<br/><br/>Player A (Pront): me and Gonder sits behind the barn, drinking.<br/>Player B (Gonder): Jihaaa!

Mostly the focus will shift from one thing to another, and a third, especially in the early stages of the play-mode. Keeping several balls in the air is easy, and fun, and one of the reasons I invented this particular play-mode. <br/><br/>The key to it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">building speed</span>; as a GM you must be ready to cut a scene, and start the next, with no words to "fill the gaps", just: "Cut! Next scene!" (Cut &amp; Go). It has modifications for different situations, but essentially it works the same for all kinds of situations with lots of people interacting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308905/#Comment_308905" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T00:22:00+00:00" title="January 21, 2011 12:22AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that example, because you can really see how the frenetic, relentless push to move to the next bit adds some dynamism and interest to a situation which doesn't really carry a lot of inherent drama or conflict.  What could have been a bunch of players sort of flailing around looking for some interesting direction to move in turns into a series of little virtuoso moments: here's the immediate situation, here's the question that's before your character right now, tell us your character's answer!  Instead of the barn dance being four characters in search of an interesting event, it literally forces each of them to focus very intently on making a particular, specific moment interesting.  Neat trick.<br/><br/>Although it does make me wonder, do you ever find it useful/interesting/fun to slow down the pace and linger over a particular scene, or is it always "Cut!  Next scene!" rapid-fire pacing?  Other types of fiction often vary their pace and produce insane amounts of intensity by slowing a scene down, so that the emotion and the drama sink in rather than being expended in one crazy push.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308907/#Comment_308907" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T01:07:02+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  1:07AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2011 1:08AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Neat trick.</blockquote>Thanks!

How do they make these scenes? What are the techniques for initiating the scene, setting the focus, and maintaining it?<br/><br/>I use voice.<br/><br/>One such moment of calm came in the midst of a war-scenario some years back. It was in the first developments of the play-modes I'm talking of here, a scenario set to a civil-war in a small kingdom. The characters were soldiers attacking a village in the dim light of morning, burning and killing all they could see (they were ordered to). The carnage was played out in a whirlwind of action- and anxiety-filled scenes, and then, suddenly ...<br/><br/><i>- (I change my voice, and force myself to calmness): Private Lommen sit on his knees in the mud, utterly bloodied and weary. He has a spear, but it is not his own. He don't know where he got it. It is full of blood. In spite of the battle raging around Lommen, no one is attacking him.<br/>- The player was really fired up by the play mode, so he did not quite fathom the situation at first. He asked; "Eh ... what? Is no one attacking me?" <br/>- I responded <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in fiction</span> (using a very calm voice, almost soothing): You sit there, no one attacking you, blood on your hands, dead bodies all around, and the fight still raging in all directions. It's hard to fathom, but nothing is threatening you. It's like being in a magic bubble of calm. You sag in the mud, and you notice a yellow-winged sparrow on an overturned cart, chirping ... What kind of emotion is heralded within you, by the sparrows chirping?"<br/>- And he answered: "I feel nothing. I am empty. There are no feelings in me. I just ... sit there."</i><br/><br/>Our hearts all went out to the player, and his character, for the blink of an eye. And then the carnage continued!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308954/#Comment_308954" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T10:27:27+00:00" title="January 21, 2011 10:27AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas,<br/><br/>Great stuff!<br/><br/>Can you tell us more about lessons you've learned about this style of play?

What does it require from the players?<br/><br/>As for my own commentary:<br/><br/>While it seems like a very powerful technique to dial back the tempo in a reflective/quiet scene, it might be similarly powerful to take a moment of intense conflict and suddenly dive into at a very slow tempo, to build anticipation and delay resolution. Not only to see Private Lommen contemplating a bird, but perhaps also in mid-swing against an old enemy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308980/#Comment_308980" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T14:29:38+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  2:29PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2011 2:33PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Paul!<br/><br/>The <i>slow motion fighting</i> you describe is not what I'm after, but sure; it could a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very nice touch</span>, especially in a cineastic-style samurai game; <i>While contemplating the bloom of a cherry tree, I let my katana dive into the swallow-wing against his neck ...</i> I believe it depends on the players, but I do imagine that most players will take to it quite fast, and be amused by the cool strangeness of it.<br/><br/>Lessons learned on play-mode;<br/>- that it is damn easy to make tight and tense drama this way.<br/>- that it's so intense you come out feeling dirty, and not up to ordinary role-playing (lesson from game-convention)<br/>- that the players need some knowledge of the setting to frame good scenes in these play-modes<br/>- that lack of knowledge can be countermanded by easing up on the setting, leaving the players to create it on the spot                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_309194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309194/#Comment_309194" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T03:05:44+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  3:05AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2011 3:08AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Reflective scenes is regularly used in the aftermath of the up-tempo play-mode, but are also used in-between more speedy scenes, to contrast them, and to make "the sudden calm moment in the midst of chaos" a part of the game.<br/><br/>You need these reflective scenes to measure the depths of the emotional drama connected to the action.</blockquote>An important thing to note on reflective scenes, is that they don't have to stretch for ever and ever.

You get the food, you eat and drink, and you spill some, and you smile over the memory of Oland with a hot potato in his mouth.
