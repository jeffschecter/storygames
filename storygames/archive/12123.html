I recently I had a handful of groups do some independent playtesting on the con scenario I've been running with for the last two years. The scenario seemed solid to me, but I needed to get some external feedback to be sure. Thus I posted a request for testers and then sent along the following email to those who responded:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/original%20email">original email</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Hello Burners!<br/>\nYour playtest group is to run Trouble in Hochen<br/>\nYour playtest group must provide an after-play (AP) report.<br/>\nScenarios should not run for more than one session -- 2 to 5 hours. If your scenario goes longer than one session, do not continue it. Report it in your AP.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour APs are due May 23rd. People who complete early will get another -- much more fun -- assignment as a bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not send me recordings of your sessions. I do not have time to listen to them. Please provide written feedback as described below. It might be useful to assign a non-GM player the role of secretary in order to note down the play data as it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour AP for each scenario must include:<br/>\nNumber of players.<br/>\nGeneral RPG experience of players.<br/>\nGeneral BW experience of players.<br/>\nSession length.<br/>\nCharacters used.<br/>\n<br/>\nTest Log: ability tested, intent/task, obstacle, pass or fail. (Yes, I want a list of every test in the session, if possible.)<br/>\nDuel of Wits Statements and Comprises.<br/>\nFight/RnC results: number of exchanges, injuries sustained<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief overview of the fictional results of the session. In other words, what happened? This should be no more than a paragraph. Don't give me a blow by blow.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoints of Confusion: As the GM, was there a point in the scenario in which you were lost and didn't know what to do? Describe it for me, please.<br/>\nPoints of Zen: As the GM, was there a point in the scenario in which you made the right intuitive decision and play flowed along? Describe it briefly for me, please.<br/>\n<br/>\nMissing Elements: What is the scenario missing?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer Observation: Was there a point at which the players became bored or disengaged?

I look forward to hearing about your games!</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nSome of you may remember this scenario. I ran it a number of times in the past two or three years. I thought this playtest report was particularly useful. There's a lot of raw data plus good negative and positive feedback. (Posted with the playtester's permission. Names omitted to protect the guilty.)<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/playtester%20response">playtester response</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Just ran Trouble in Hochen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>We had:</b><br/>\nFour players<br/>\nEveryone has done multiple BW campaigns.<br/>\nSession length was ~3 hours.<br/>\nCharacters used: the Knight, the Priest, the Dwarf.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Tests:</b><br/>\n*Blessing (Ob3) Success +1D to Suasion<br/>\n*Theoden Suasion Ob4 to get Rayla to tell the truth, if they fail they get convinced to come out of the Biting cold ...

They suffered four Mortal wounds and one Severe wound. They knocked the Knight down at one point and achieved a 1D Lock. They were then Hindranced.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe then ran out of time and had the demon bear arrive and Bloody Versus'd 7D for the bear and 8D for the PCs (4D Knight + 1D armour + 1D Faith + 1D Persona + 1D Axe help from Fureard). The bear lost by 3 successes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Fiction:</b><br/>\nThe characters arrived and immediately bullied the burgraf into telling them about the cultists. Fureard went searching the ruins, and returned to tell tale of the demon shit that quivered and leant toward him in the ruins. They went searching for the cultists and heard their plans to sacrifice them. They surprised them coming out of the hall and laid into them. Their bloody fight was interrupted by the demon bear; it was cut up badly and retreated to its lair where they tracked it down and dispatched it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Points of Confusion:</b><br/>\nMy explanation of the setup seemed that it could have gone better; the original Belief the Knight put forward was to win a tourney in Hochen. I stumbled there but after reaching for the talk about famine and demons that Belief was adjusted to slaying the demon for renown. The exact procedure for laying out player Beliefs at the start in general made me stumble.<br/>\n<br/>\nTying in the Dwarf's treasure hunting made me hesitate as well. I think a better If You Fail from me could have helped there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Points of Zen:</b><br/>\nOnce the cultists were in play and the situation was more immediate things felt a lot easier and more fluid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Missing Elements:</b><br/>\nThe players agreed that the Dwarf could have used a more solid hook in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Player Observation:</b><br/>\nThey said the fight with the cultists seemed to take a fair amount of time, though they said they were not disinterested at any point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Player Feedback:</b><br/>\nThe player of the Priest struggled to make Faith a rare thing and not throw Faith at every opportunity. It seemed difficult to not have him constantly test Faith trying to harm their opponents and benefit the other players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also said the third Beliefs for the characters seemed somewhat more like Instincts than Beliefs. Proto-Beliefs. One of them wrote it this way: I believe X therefore I want Y therefore I shall Z<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that's helpful -- if you want to know anything more let me know.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAfter receiving a number of responses in this vein, I realize that I've forgotten a key question in the playtest reports. I forgot to ask the groups to log artha spent and earned. That's a very important part of BW play. The data I do have lets me know how the mechanics are working, but not how the players are emotionally responding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh well.

They found that using a methodologically sound instrument, you'll expose 95% of usability problems after a dozen users or less (Nielsen argues for five in some circumstances). Some people take this as gospel and others don't, but in my experience with usability testing of Web interfaces it seems to bear out pretty well. The first time I conducted a quick-and-dirty usability test I had a 20 user sample and I noted the results after ten. It would have been enough for our needs and after that I cut my users in half without any apparent ill effect.<br><br>To extrapolate this for tabletop playtesting, it means you are probably in the sweet spot if you are getting a dozen thoughtful returns <i>and </i>you are asking the right questions. The latter is pretty important, obviously. Talking about instrument design would be really cool - I'd love to get some social scientists discussing that. All my usability work has been pretty specific to Web interfaces, so I'm not sure I'd have much to contribute.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271723/#Comment_271723" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T15:01:14+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  3:01PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2010 3:01PM by jenskot.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone is interested in Usability Testing, I highly recommend...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292" rel="nofollow">Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems</a><br/>\n(short but entertaining)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.amazon.com/Landing-Page-Optimization-Definitive-Conversions/dp/0470174625/" rel="nofollow">Landing Page Optimization: The Definitive Guide to Testing and Tuning for Conversions</a><br/>\n(detailed but dry)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271745/#Comment_271745" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T17:01:18+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  5:01PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty much with Jason said.

Remember that this is a con scenario being tested -- its purpose is at least in part to promote the game to interested parties, some of whom have presumably never played the game before. Consequently, a sample of playtest groups consisting largely (or in the case of the example, entirely) of very experienced Burning Wheel players is going to skew the results. So when you see in the first series of tests that the player has rolled over a success into a +1D on the next test, you have to consider whether a player with no expectations of game difficulty and little or no experience with the system would have considered that option. (I have no idea, this is just an example.)<br><br>There's not a lot Luke can do to correct for this in terms of recruitment -- unless he wants to start paying people to test his con scenarios -- so it's just something to keep in mind when reviewing the reports. If a group of experienced BW players finds a fight too challenging, for example, that's going to be even more worrisome for a con scenario.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272189/#Comment_272189" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T08:49:38+00:00" title="May 20, 2010  8:49AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, ICE, looking at the reports, we had a good mix of experienced and inexperienced players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276736/#Comment_276736" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T02:24:55+00:00" title="June 18, 2010  2:24AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2010 2:25AM by Tim_Gray.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ndp</cite>Assuming that (a) the thing in question is<i>ready to be tested</i>(fully conceptualized, tested in-house, modeled well, etc) and (b) the users that are testing it are<i>representative samples</i>of your target user base, you will probably get all of the useful feedback you need in order to validate and revise the project from as few as 7 users, and you'll probably top out around 12 or so in terms of learning something new.<br><br>That said, you could have a pool of 100 users, and if only 10 of them are representative samples of the target audience, you may have to wade through a ton of useless and non-informative feedback.

A lot of people have a target audience in mind from the get-go, so that makes it easier. But I would say that the first question to ask is "why am I making X"? For the sake of this discussion, X is "a new, original tabletop roleplaying game" Here's some fake examples!<br><br>- If you are making the game because you are unsatisfied with a current game (or selection of similar games), then your target audience is probably going to be people who have experience with that game and may be looking for the same kind of "fix"<br><br>- If you are making the game because you want to explore new ground and push boundaries, then your target audience is probably going to be people interested in experimental and fringe games, and may very well include folks in adjacent "zones" (like larpers or casual digital game players or something)<br><br>- If you are making the game because you had a great idea that excites you, then your target audience is probably going to be people who get excited by the same things that you do, and you can probably find them in the social groups you're already involved in<br><br>- If you are making the game in order to make a statement, then your target audience is probably going to be a mix of people who are interested in statement-making in general, and the people that the statement is aimed towards.<br><br>And so on. <br><br>In terms of finding those people, one way may be to make a list of games that occupy the same "zone" as your game, and try to find fans of those games. Another may be to make a list of non-game-specific demographic and lifestyle attributes, and find ways to get your word out into those adjacent but maybe overlapping interest zones (like, taking out an ad in a BMX online newsletter if your game is about the rad world of BMX, that kind of thing).<br><br>A really effective way, as we see around here all the time, is post content from your game (or a free ready-to-play version) and see who jumps on it. Then you can potentially leverage those initial users social connections to find other like-minded users.<br><br>A big reminder: just because you identify a "typical" or "perfect" user DOES NOT MEAN that you are shutting out other kinds of people. People will find ways to get into all kinds of things you'd never imagine them to be interested in from demographics. But concentrating on finding your ideal user is a good exercise for you in terms of making decisions about your design, and will certainly pay off in terms of playtesting and marketing.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
