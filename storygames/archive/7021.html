There's a bunch of info you can find out about it in other places. Perhaps the best place is on our forums (malladinsgate.lefora.com). You can also download a couple of previews from the forum there if you're interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the rules for this forum says that I should only post here to generate discussion. so here goes:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhilst the mechanics used in Gateway came straight from the heads of myslef and my co-writer, and in my experience are pretty unique within rpgs, I am not so arrogant as to assume that someone else might have done the same before me and I've just not noticed it. So here are the three things that I think are unique about Gateway and, if you are interested in joining in the discussion, you tell me if you know of anything similar already published. My background in gaming is in more traditional games, and I have written a lot previously for the D20 system and played a lot of Storyteller/ing System games, Savage Worlds, and the like, so I am not massively familiar with the indie scene. So just how unique are our ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Backgrounds: These generall fill the roll of skills in traditional rpgs, but are quite general in their use, and relate to what your character has done in their past, or other ways in which they interact with the world. You can use a background for a range of different tasks, including performing some kind of action, having knowledge of related topics, noticing things related to your background area, investigating or researching within your background area, making a "narrative intervention" to make different things happen in the story, and acquiring items or information. You can see this system in more detail by downloading teh first of our previews. Has one score been used in RPGs to do all of these things together?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Equipment: This is perhaps the one that I think someone /must/ have done previously, but I can't think of an example. Gateway uses equipment traits to describe an item you might use. For example a handgun might have the weapon, pistol and firearm traits. These are the only game stats equipment needs. you can apply whichever traits are appropriate to a given action to gain a +1 bonus to a background roll. However, some traits block the use of other equipment traits by your opponent. For example, a Bulletproof trait on a kevlar vest might block the Fiream bonus being applied. I know of games that use equipment traits (or weapon traits at the very least) on top of otehr more traditional game stats (range, damage, etc), but I can't think of a system that uses just traits to describe equipment. Are there any? You can see this system in our second download.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The third item is the biggie and won't be available until the book is released (probably next week). The system's main "engine" is called the Drama Resolution System, and works in a very different way to traditional rpgs. Rather than trying to model the physical position and competencies of individuals within a combat system, the Drama resolution system instead abstracts all dramatic situations and your actions and dice rolled influences the ebb and flow of tension and drama within the scene, recreating the feel of such scenes in films, TV shows, novels, etc. Now I know it may be difficult to discuss this system before the rulebook comes out, but I was wondering if anyone knew of games that at least attempted the same ends?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your comments,<br/>\n<br/>\nBen                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156182/#Comment_156182" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T03:39:13+00:00" title="July 12, 2008  3:39AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Without knowing some more detailed information about the aspects of your game you describe (e.g. the actual rules and some exmaples of their use in play), I would have to say that 'Backgrounds' sounds pretty much like Traits and the 'Drama Resolution System' sounds pretty much like Conflkict Resolution. So in answer to the question, how unique are those ideas, I'd have to to say pretty much every indie game out there has beaten you to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe traits for gear sounds interesting though: i can't think of a system that handles gear in that way, since in most indie games gear is either a)irrelevant or b) its just another kind of Trait  in itself. If you want a unique pitch for your game, thats the aspect I'd focus on, but without knowing a bit more about it, I can't really say for definite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156184/#Comment_156184" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T06:02:00+00:00" title="July 12, 2008  6:02AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Overall, it sounds pretty neat.

Your resolution system may end up being 75% like Dogs but the 25% that isn't may be pure gold. If you still want to check these games out, I would strongly advice you to play them rather than just reading their texts. How they sound may be very different that how they feel in play. You don't want to get to the point where your drawing of a human figure is influenced by the drawing of another person's human figure which was influenced by a book on anatomy which was influenced by technical drawings and become farther and farther disconnected from the actual source material. <br/><br/>Also, what has been common place or old hat in this community for years is likely the new cool thing to most traditional gamers out there. This community in many ways is a creative think tank on the bleeding edge. You likely don't want to test your game for uniqueness here as it isn't a realistic sample of your likely target audience. That being said, this community is filled with excited and helpful people. Use us and give back and use us again!

I think perhaps it will be in the implementation that Gateway shows its "uniqueness" - or at least how it is different from what else is out there. After all, I think it was Descartes who said that there's no such thing as a truely new idea, just new ways of merging existing ideas together (put it has been nearly 15 years since I studied philosophy :) ), and I think I can see how Gateway uses different bits from other things, but merges them together in new ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we're heading for release next week, and at $4.95 maybe some of you might be tempted to download and provide us with some more feedback. We're new to the indie scene, but I think there's certain truths about "good gaming" that indie games designers have realised mechanically that the rest of perhaps just do "around" the systems of our trad games, so we're hopeful that we'll have a game that will appeal to a cross section of both indie and trad gamers. But as we're new to it all, its always a bit of a guess :).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheerio for now,<br/>\n<br/>\nBen<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Oliof - I've fixed the hosting issue so you can download the previes direct from our website (http://malladinsgate.com/products/release.php?Type=ComingSoon&amp;)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156322/#Comment_156322" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-13T11:57:37+00:00" title="July 13, 2008 11:57AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that while it might hold superficial appearance to other games.<br/>\nI find that Gateway implements the Traits and Backgrounds in a way I had not seen before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/malladin_ben" title="malladin_ben"><img alt="malladin_ben" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/malladin_ben">malladin_ben</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156983/#Comment_156983" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T13:08:46+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  1:08PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's now available (http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=56799) and only 4.99.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you got out and buy it, why not post back here and see if your opinion changes...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheerio,<br/>\n<br/>\nBen                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
