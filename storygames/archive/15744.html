What is their motivation?  Before psychoanalysis killed god, all we had to work with was the soul and this disposable physical material to ferret out the mysteries of life.  When all else is stripped away, there sits your somewhat anonymous skeleton.  In the 20th Century, some of this complexity and wonder/horror gets supplanted by Ray Harryhausen where skeletons become fx kindling. Aint nothing wrong there, just sorta taking some of the meat off the bone, as it were.<br/><br/>**extra, extra credit: totally saw Jason Morningstar impersonator dressed like the lead singer to Dexy's Midnight Runner get on the 3 train at 42nd street today.

It'll just make them more dangerous."<br/><br/>I also might suggest: There's no differentiating between a dead skeleton and an animated skeleton until it moves. And skeletons have a habit of waiting until the last possible moment to move - maybe they realize they're not fast runners.<br/><br/>You're looting a dungeon, right? You know what is littered throughout the entire dungeon? Skeletons. And most are loot mannequins, with powerful relics adorning their necks and belt-lines. But disturb the slumber of the wrong skeleton, and it'll re-animate and chew your throat open, right as you're reaching for its trinkets.<br/><br/>Put the PCs in a situation with little to no lighting, with lots of skeletons, and with weird moaning noises that always seem to come from three rooms down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357195/#Comment_357195" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T12:51:56+00:00" title="February  1, 2012 12:51PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of personalizing them.

That's what skeletons should do - there never should be a 'room full of skeletons' encounter you can know before in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat skeletons do is surround you, cut off exit routes, appear from the least expected location, leverage their higher numbers tactically (attack someone from the front and back simultaneously, for example), attack the weakest and pin the strongest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's skeleton tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about their motivation? I'm all for the 'angry spirit' camp of what makes the fellows tick - the more angry, the more tick. But what makes them angry? Clearly, their (or their fellows') tombs or burial places being desecrated. What counts as desecration? Well, the usual stuff - being there, for one, and also taking stuff you shouldn't. But also probably harming what's left of the physical body of the skeleton.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the more you harm a skeleton, the angrier the spirit powering it gets, and the more dangerous it and other skeletons become.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAn all-skeleton dungeon could be an inversion of the usual dungeon-crawl - the problem is not getting deep into the dungeon to get the Fabled Sword of the High-King, it's fighting your way out of it after the High-King and his hundred guardians arise from their slumber after you try to take that sword.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357198/#Comment_357198" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T13:01:10+00:00" title="February  1, 2012  1:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2012 1:03PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of skeletons used for surprise tactics in war:<br><br>They can do things and get places that are very unexpected. <br><br>Maybe they walk across the ocean floor, crossing the Bay and entering the besieged city at night through the Port.<br><br>Or maybe they can be packed into a small space, without air or food, and emerge, attacking, three months later (like the Trojan Horse).<br><br>Or maybe they can be thrown over the wall with a catapult, and are taken simply to be bones (launched over the walls to demoralize the defenders) until they reanimate a few hours later.<br><br>Or maybe the enemy general creates huge walls of flame to deter your troops from advancing... but the skeletons walk right through them, attacking you when you least expect it, their bones glowing with embers, their weapons smoldering with heat.<br><br/>(Do they need to see?

Intact they're worth quite a bit to the right collectors, smashed they're worthless dust.<br/><br/>The centers of the bones, where the marrow would be in a living skeleton, have been surrounded in necromantic energy for as long as the skeleton has been animated. Who knows what's been incubating in there that could be unleashed if you crack the bones?<br/><br/>These skeletons are from a group of people whose religion dictates that defiling a body after death jeopardizes the immortal soul of the person. Permanently harming the skeletons would count as defilement. An adventurer who defiles a corpse would surely earn the enmity of the person's family, etc.<br/><br/>Depending on the magical physics of the world, animated skeletons could be very light compared to a person, and encountered in places where it's hard to get the leverage/hard surfaces to smash them (e.g. rope bridges, ship rigging, etc.).<br/><br/>The bones for these skeletons were leftovers from a magical experiment that was meant to replace the bones of powerful people/creatures with something more durable, but the souls came along with the extracted bones, animating them. If the skeletons are smashed the souls will be able to return to the original enhanced creature, waking it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357206/#Comment_357206" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T13:49:09+00:00" title="February  1, 2012  1:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2012 1:51PM by Krippler.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On topic:<br/><br/>Skeletons with eyeballs.

Once activated, the skeleton feeds on the energies of that person's connection to a particular friend or family member. As the skeleton is energized, the person's connection, no matter how far away they are, becomes tired and sick. Doctors will be mystified as to what is causing the condition if it persists, and no cure will help them. They will eventually die if the skeleton remains animated...at which point the skeleton, too, will "die" as the there will be no energy left to feed.<br/><br/>Defeating the skeleton within a short amount of time will, of course, let the connection regain his or her health. If their sickness has gone on for any length of time, the medical practicioners will declare the recovery a miracle. However, a price is still to be paid, as defeating the skeleton also breaks the connection; what was once a happy, energetic relationship will soon be found to be dull and uninteresting. Marriages will simply dissolve, and friends will quietly part. <br/><br/>If the hero does not make contact with his connection for a long while after the skeleton is destroyed, the memories of each other will simply fade away, leaving a "hole in the soul," a feeling as if there was something they lost, but they can never truly remember what it was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357257/#Comment_357257" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T19:04:40+00:00" title="February  1, 2012  7:04PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>There is a scary skeleton butt, right inside your butt!</blockquote>\nThis thread is kinda creeping me out about my own insides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357259/#Comment_357259" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T19:49:05+00:00" title="February  1, 2012  7:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A skeleton can only be harmed by weapons as old as it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357263/#Comment_357263" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T20:23:10+00:00" title="February  1, 2012  8:23PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skeletons can see only the past and any living thing they encounter appears as a vision of horror, hatred, or pain from their former lives.

The use of skulls and skeletons as a reminder of death probably goes back to the birth of symbolism, but it really hit its stride during the Middle Ages and the Black Plague.  <br/><br/>I think its depictions of the <i>Memento Mori</i> and <i>Danse Macabre</i> that really get at what is scary about skeletons by either juxtaposing them with mundane life (paintings of skeletons and skulls next to domestic objects) or showing the skeletons indulging in behaviors that we associate with the enjoyment of life (dancing, drinking, feasting, etc.) It's the <i>contrast</i> between death and life that really unsettles us. Skeletons that refuse to be simply dead, that refuse to give up their humanity and act like monsters, those guys are scary.<br/><br/>I think the RPG that I've played that best gets this is Bret Gillan's <i>Cold Soldier</i>, although it doesn't deal strictly with skeletons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS" title="L.Trenti MrVALIS"><img alt="L.Trenti MrVALIS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/372/n6DOEFUWMI7ZW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS">L.Trenti MrVALIS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357267/#Comment_357267" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T21:55:42+00:00" title="February  1, 2012  9:55PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2012 9:56PM by L.Trenti MrVALIS.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now THIS was scary.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h03QBNVwX8Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h03QBNVwX8Q</a><br/>Watched it as a child and still creeps me out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mockingbard" title="Mockingbard"><img alt="Mockingbard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.pyresofvam.com/wp-content/themes/piano-black/img/fire32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mockingbard">Mockingbard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357293/#Comment_357293" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T02:14:05+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  2:14AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2012 2:14AM by Mockingbard.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite>Skeletons with eyeballs.

Once adventurers arrive in all their fleshy glory, the skeletons' lack of life becomes clear, the dream is shattered and the skeletons blame the living intruders. Skeletons attack with their hands and teeth, even if using weapons they try to grab you. <br/><br/>Upon being touched by a skeleton, their memories flood into you: playing with their children in a park; marrying their wife; the satisfaction of a hard day's labour and drinks with friends at the tavern. Their touch also saps the flesh from your bones; it crawls off your bones and onto the skeleton, restoring it to a semblance of life but in your guise (or a strange mongrel mix of many people it has sapped). It's disguise is nowhere near perfect. It holds up as human from a distance, but close inspection reveals some irregularities, and it begins falling apart within hours or days. They can't talk, but make rough, throaty noises and their eyes are unfocused or work independently. They can look sort of normal but always kinda wrong or creepy. Like they're wearing an <a href="http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/edgar.jpg" rel="nofollow">Edgar suit</a>.<br/><br/>If the skeleton saps enough flesh to become whole again it seeks out living people and tries to recreate its memories. It approaches children in a park; it crashes a wedding, believing itself to be the groom; it pulls up a chair at a tavern and joins the living there, pouring a drink down its disconnected throat. In close proximity it doesn't take long for others to realise something is wrong. In defence or in anger at the spoiled recreations of its memories, it attacks, drains more flesh and moves on to find another place where it can try again to relive its memories. Hopefully those adventurers it attacked but didn't kill will use the flashes of its memories they saw to work out where it would go and track it down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357296/#Comment_357296" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T04:46:03+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  4:46AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mockingbard</cite>Hopefully those adventurers it attacked but didn't kill will use the flashes of its memories they saw to work out where it would go and track it down.</blockquote>\nNow that's what I'm talking about!

But the meat-head who smashes the old King to bits isn't just destroying a threat, he's erasing vital and irreplaceable knowledge of the past.

And for that to work, I need (a) the skeleton to have a decent chance to actually touch me, even if I've got a staff or other long weapon, thus they probably need to be fast or ignore impact; and (b) my flesh to stay messed up somehow even if the skeleton is defeated and dime-a-dozen healing magic is used on me.<br/><br/>I think the thing that makes the skeletons initially scary in that Argonauts clip is the fact that the heroes retreat from them.

"Oh no brer wizard, please dont bind me in the mundane plane!"<br/><br/>Reason being they are lowest demons on the totem poll where they come from, and in the mundane plane, they are relatively powerful and dont have uber-powerful, uber-nasty demons tormenting and commanding them.  Doesnt mean they <i>want</i> to stay enslaved to an 'evil' wizard, but it sure as hell beats the alternative.  So they make great wizard assistants because they are magical, more or less amoral,  and will do anything to avoid being banished back to where they came.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357473/#Comment_357473" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T23:34:21+00:00" title="February  2, 2012 11:34PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2012 11:34PM by stefoid.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I think the thing that makes the skeletons initially scary in that Argonauts clip is the fact that the heroes retreat from them.

       In the game we're currently playing, the GM used skeletons to great effect by first establishing the preconception that mass-graves with skeletons do not become animate and then switching it up on us in a room carpeted with bones. They weren't strong on their own, but we stood in a sea of them. We could crack skulls easily, it being a fantasy game and all, but the short corridor suddenly became longer than all the long ones put together when the doors at either end started closing on us and we had to rend the ocean of undeath to make it to safety. We weren't really wounded that badly, I think my character was cut on the arm, but it felt more dangerous than the one where they'd messed him up a lot worse because of the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat scenario, of course, might not work in a horror game, or a situation where the skeletons are meant to create an atmosphere of undulating, spine-borne evil. So to a certain extent I'd say you have to pick the right skelly for the job. It's all about what the skeleton can do for your over-arching narrative program.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357488/#Comment_357488" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T05:04:42+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  5:04AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When the players need to squeeze through a tight area that they cannot move easily in hordes coming from the front and back would be scary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357508/#Comment_357508" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T07:35:09+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  7:35AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skeletons are not animated corpses.

If they tear into you with their fingers, then you are almost certainly infected.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen infected, plague quickly lodges in your own bones. You feel hotter and hotter, all over, with no clear source. Your only chance to stay cool at first is to take off your clothes, but soon that's not enough. You can sit in cold water, but in no time it feels like it's boiling (and maybe it actually is). Snow and ice can't soothe the heat. Aching for cool, you begin to tear at your own flesh. With each bloody handful, you feel a moment's release, so you keep tearing. You tear and tear until there's nothing left of you but your skeleton, with the fiery plague still burning inside. The only source of comfort is to tear into others, to pour the heat from yourself into another body. But it never ends. Even when they smash you up, and you are little more than broken pieces of oozing bone, the heat never ends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357515/#Comment_357515" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T07:55:31+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  7:55AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2012 7:55AM by mease19.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The think about skeletons is that they're made of bones and the thing about bones is that they smell awful when you burn them (really, they do).

Glad you like them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'd also point out that Mockingbardian Skeletons<i>know stuff</i>- they remember important details of their lives and transmit that to their victims. So it is easy to imagine circumstances in which a seeker of knowledge might hunt down the living skeleton of the ancient King of the Nau Tuchaninut Dwarves and willingly accept his dry embrace...at least for a little while. But the meat-head who smashes the old King to bits isn't just destroying a threat, he's erasing vital and irreplaceable knowledge of the past. Which of the Three Elven Regents was given the Rod of Selka the Arbiter at the old Dwarf's coronation five hundred years ago? The fate of a kingdom rests on knowing.</blockquote>\nThis is awesome. Full of story potential. I'll be looking for excuses to use the new skeletons in my home game as soon as I can.<br><br>I like that my skeletons could mesh with Graham's idea or some of David's ideas. I'm picturing someone who took a hit from a skeleton, a big chunk of skin and flesh now missing from their forearm and their max HP reduced by however much damage that did until they can get the flesh back. So, that means tracking the skeleton down, subduing or killing it and dragging it to a healer. Meanwhile, perhaps the longer you take, the larger the wound becomes, slowly turning you skeletal, as David suggested.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I would like to see Mockingbardian Skeletons worked up as Dungeon World monsters, complete with custom moves.

Think isolated woodcutters living with illicit skeletons of their dead wives, grieving mothers futily suckling slowly-grasping skeletons of their dead babies. They stay on THIER feet as long as someone has NEED of them, and even if you smash them to pieces, it's that need that compels them, eventually allowing them to rise again and again until theyre not needed.

They're a mish-mash of bones from different bodies, all wired-up and pinned at the joints, maybe a few animal bones thrown in when needed, nothing like clean ranks of uniformed soldiers. They move like the kludged-together marionettes they are, and the life force that animates them is the rent fragments of souls in all those bones raging against each other, a dozen bodies all rejecting each others' grafts.

When someone dies alone in the home, or has a heart attack in the woods, or drowns while swimming in the river... there's some great fodder for a budding necromancer. You could have a great heart-tearing story about a young student of the necromantic arts who finds his grandmother dead in her cabin, and now must decide whether he is willing to defile her memory in order to take the opportunity to actually practice what he has been taught.<br/><br/>And, of course, any kind of natural disaster, plague, or site of battle will sooner or later attract a necromancer (or bizarre, otherworldly creatures interested in the same). Kings and generals will sometimes need to decide whether it is more important to move on and destroy their fleeing enemies' forces, or to take the extra day or two to make camp and destroy the bodies of their dead so they won't reanimate behind their lines later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mockingbard" title="Mockingbard"><img alt="Mockingbard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.pyresofvam.com/wp-content/themes/piano-black/img/fire32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mockingbard">Mockingbard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380938/#Comment_380938" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T04:43:51+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  4:43AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2012 4:44AM by Mockingbard.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I would like to see Mockingbardian Skeletons worked up as Dungeon World monsters, complete with custom moves.

Once killed, their corpses join the skeletal armies, waiting for the next fools to get close enough.<br/><br/>And the valley is littered with the magical equipment and treasures of those foolish enough to risk trying to retrieve the legendary artifacts that the pair of wizards carried with them to try to ensure their victory. Which is why as centuries pass, the valley keeps growing, like a malignant cancer poisoning the lands of the living.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zircher</cite>To turn the gruesome meter up a notch, in such as world as Valamir's, necromancers would just have to rip out the skeletons of living people and use those.  Even worse, perhaps being living is part of the magical sacrifice that goes into making a skeleton slave.  Or, perhaps your skeletons are actually a swarm of flesh eating beetles that use the skeleton as some freakish host.  (Like the Myrmidons in Hellas?)<br/>--<br/>TAZ</blockquote>\nSkeletons <b>are not</b> undead. They are, in fact, still living. The necromantic energies surrounding them is what keeps them "alive", even after all their flesh, muscles and organs have already decayed away. (In fact, the necrotic energies accelerate that decay.)<br/><br/>So they are individuals trapped in an incomplete body, used as glorified marionettes by the Necromancer who denies them their proper rest, unable to perceive the outside world since their sensory organs have been gone for so long... At the very least, they feel no (physical) pain anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381169/#Comment_381169" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T07:57:32+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  7:57AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skeletons are humanity stripped away.
