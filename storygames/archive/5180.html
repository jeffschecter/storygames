Frex, my friends chipped in and bought Steve, my high school DM, the Dark Sun boxed set the year it came out (together we played AD&amp;D 2e for a few years, usually bi-weekly or so). That kind of thing.<br/><br/>Nowadays, though, the game sessions feel far more like collectives of friends, without a single regular GM (save me for my weekly group).  I gave a new player to our monthly D&amp;D 3e game a set of polyhedrals (as he was new to gaming, didn't have a set and was borrowing ours, and I had some extra tubes from an order I made to Koplow Games), but that's about it. In my weekly group, our GM is often Me. Instead, we often buy gifts (usually food, beer or random book/game) to The Person Whose House We Game At Regularly.</blockquote>\nHow about you? XMas/B-Day presents for "The GM"?  presents for other players? Presents for anyone?  Why or why not?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116925/#Comment_116925" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T17:36:53+00:00" title="December 28, 2007  5:36PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We all share food every week and occasionally get each other gifts.

In the gaming culture I was brought up in, we either pooled money, regardless of who is host or the GM, for food or we dealt with food for ourselves -- everyone is always on the same level.<br/><br/>That said, when I go to conventions with a decent dealer's room or hall, I shop for post-con gifts for my gaming group friends.
