I don't like "race separate from class" because it results in min-maxing ("If you want to be a mage, be sure to choose elf"). The solution we adopted for ACKS has neither of these issues. </blockquote>\nThis is true! But I like that demihumans become monocultural. I don't think they necessarily become bland, though. At least not much blander than the four human classes. If you want some variety, you could just use <a href="http://planetalgol.blogspot.ca/2012/08/random-table-what-does-elf-bleed.html" rel="nofollow">a random table to determine what your elf character bleeds</a> (Sean's elf bleeds hummingbirds and you can guess what my elf bleeds).<br/><br/>With race being separate, humans almost never get any real specialization, so for whichever class you choose, there's some non-human race that does it best, usually. And so you get fewer human PCs. ACKS does it the old Talislanta way, where instead of one race being better at a specific class, each race has their own set of classes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424667/#Comment_424667" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T10:49:20+00:00" title="November 23, 2013 10:49AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the ACKS approach it's easy to drop classes you don't dig, to get back to the old monocultured style.

It's like the game is saying that these beings are so unlike humans that we could not even relate to their internal social processes; the best we can do is to group them all under this one label. Very true to life, that, and in an amusingly ironical way, as it's not just us as the audience who are in the dark about the internal nature of the elf; we the creators, and even we the game designers have chosen to leave it as an unanswerable conundrum at the point where we satisfy ourselves with this simplistic archetypal gloss. Anything we'll come to know about the elf will ultimately have to come from actual experiences in play. It also makes for some really cool character classes: you don't need to choose whether your character is a dwarven priest or a dwarven fighter, he can be both or neither, all within a single class.<br/><br/>Of course, not playing with non-human PCs at all is also a fine option. In practice my games tend towards extreme humano-centrism, with the technical possibility of playing some sort of non-human characters as well on the occasion. I do avoid what I see as the supreme thematic weakness of trying to have both non-humans and having them be socially viable player characters - if you want to play some <i>thing</i> from the wilderness beyond human ken, why the fuck would you expect the local sheriff to just nod his head happily as you stroll the main street? (Obviously this logic only works for the sort of fantasy world where non-humans are exceptional. But again, if they're not, then we're back at the question of why not just play with human ethnicities if you want to treat your non-humans as human in all ways anyway.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424679/#Comment_424679" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T14:26:27+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  2:26PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2013 2:27PM by lumpley.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, no, the idea that a character should be <i>two things</i> (an elf AND a fighter, a wizard AND a hobbit) is the weird one.

Somebody else is playing a halfling thief? You can make an elven thief! And then both of you play the exact same kind of halfling and elf everyone else plays except they are also thieves. Which tends to be what a lot of people want.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when your party is comprised of two dwarves and three fighters, there's only so many ways you can differentiate your characters, and actually portraying some semblance of culture (or difference of cultures) is one way to do that. If both dwarf players go with the stereotype, their characters are exactly the same.

In original D&amp;D, race and class IS split, but dwarves and halflings can only be fighting-men, while elves can switch between fighting-man and magic-user from session to session.

The classes are largely socially determined according to 19th century European framework (a big part of the campaign is about dealing with the challenges and possibilities of traditional patriarchal societal roles in a strategic context), so they're things like "Gentleman Adventurer", "Expert Commoner", "Exotic Savage" and "Exceptional Female". The latter two are particularly wide and customizable because while the campaign parses <i>identities</i> in terms of simple labels, <i>abilities</i> are determined in more realistic terms; basically this means that the Female class ends up as a bit of a catch-all, there being no particular reason why a woman couldn't do most anything a man can in the setting.<br/><br/>I suspect that if the above sounds crazy, this does not particularly help anybody accept what I'm planning here, but I feel like clarifying that I consider the campaign in question to be horror fantasy by genre. There are many horrible things in the Gnostidrome (the working title of the thing), and it is quite possible that the monster is us, although one might hope that a true hero would be capable of casting aside the shackles of the demiurge when reason beckons.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424711/#Comment_424711" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T20:18:29+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  8:18PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the very first version of D&amp;D race and class were separate but limited for non-humans.

Elves and dwarves I see as primal, elemental and fey. They are not just in the world, they're a living part of it. They love and despise humans for what they are not--jealous of the freedoms they can never have. They are powerful, yet limited by their own very nature.<br/><br/>This also summed it up pretty well:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/showpost.p...8&amp;postcount=12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.therpgsite.com/showpost.p...8&amp;postcount=12</a><br/><br/>But the real reason I don't want AD&amp;D 1e or 2e or their simulacra is that I want race as class. Shocking, I know, even I was shocked when I realized that. <br/><br/>I want all Elf PCs to be the scions of the dying Emerald Empire, who, after a decades-long adolescency of honing their skills at both swordsmanship and wizardry alike (like their merciless forebearers who crossed the Emerald Portal from Arcadia to Tellus, and dropped half the world to its knees with sharp swords and sharper spells), journeying forth from the crumbling spires of the Isle of Mists in their century-long Sojourn to the Lands of Men. Most return to the Isle after their sojourn, disillusioned with the fleeting lives and the ephemeral works of the Young Races, to spend the remaining centuries contemplating the timelessness of Elven art and philosophy. A few never return, though, and earn from their kinsmen undying contempt, and the derisive appelation of "Half-Elves".<br/><br/>I want all Dwarf PCs to be envoys from Crownstone, the last citadel of the beleaguered folk who once ruled the warrens beneath the Elves' colonies, all magnificent palaces and temples and plazas carved from the very bones of the earth, bedecked with sparkling gems and precious metals, until the Cataclysmic War with the Elves, turning the dwarven race away from magic and towards their current, unyielding theocracy, after which the humanoids descended on their marvellous citadels and their own Dominion of Khazad crumbled into dust. Trained in the ancient ways of the hammer and spear, axe and shield, the Second Sons of Crownstone, those deemed unfit for the prestigious priesthood, seek their fortune in the Lands of Men, to one day return to Crownstone covered in bright gold and bloody glory.<br/><br/>And I want all Halfling PCs to be members of the Ancient and Worshipful Company of Adventurers of Greenmoot, the finest enterprise a young halfling can pledge his hard work to; the troublemakers and mavericks of the typically sedate, secluded, almost idyllic halfling society are systematically carted off to the place where they'll find what they so eagerly seek (adventure! excitement!) while providing themselves and their families with what they value the most (finincial security! creature comforts! quiet neighborhood!). The system's been in place for a while and it works. Those who survive even get to retire as respected members of the Greenmoot community.<br/><br/>Seriously, I don't give a shit about halfling clerics or dwarf bards or whatever. If they exist (and they probably do), they are not PC material. Not ion this campaign, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424722/#Comment_424722" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-24T02:40:39+00:00" title="November 24, 2013  2:40AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OSRIC's <i>Raise Dead:</i>\u201cThe eerie, keening incantation of this spell calls a soul back from the afterlife, literally bringing the dead back to life.

Rather than getting bonuses/penalties to their stat rolls as in AD&amp;D, demi-humans have minimums in certain stats.<br/><br/>B/X, RAW, also has limits on the ways that people can transfer stat points around after the character is rolled up ( 3d6, straight down the line).<br/><br/>It means not only are demi-humans rare, they also tend to start with bonuses in a couple of key stats in addition to their racial abilities.<br/><br/>I mean, elves are kinda the paladins of B/X: You have to roll well to get to play one, they get a bunch of nifty abilities, and no alignment restrictions that make them lose those abilities by behavioral no-nos.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424728/#Comment_424728" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-24T06:59:13+00:00" title="November 24, 2013  6:59AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2013 7:03AM by catty_big.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.. I\u2019m really torn about this. On the one hand, my inner namby-pamby liberal screams at the thought of whole races (Klingon, Vulcan, Ferengi etc.) being summed up by very narrow and inflexible sets of attributes (Klingons- warlike- <i>all of them</i>; Vulcans- suppress emotions- <i>all of them</i>; Ferengi- grasping and avaricious- <i>all of them</i>) but otoh, if you produced a complex and nuanced set of attributes for every non-human race in your SF or fantasy book, film or RPG, the gameworld would be too diffuse and lacking in hooks for players to latch onto. In any case, in most SF franchises (Star Trek and B5 being the ones I\u2019m most familiar with) the other races are mainly projections of specific human attributes, and can work as a way of helping us to see ourselves from the outside as it were (and improve as a result?).<br/><br/>To having 'human' as a class, why not? It works fine in games like WHFRP, probably in MERP too though I haven\u2019t played it myself. I think the only reasons designers balk at having human as a class is the thought of us being reduced to the sort of cardboard cut-outism they inflict on other races in their gameworlds, and because of course humans are superior to all other races in the Universe, aren\u2019t they? Uh-oh, I can feel my namby-pamby liberal hackles rising again, which brings us to... \n<blockquote>in my new campaign currently at planning stage being a woman specifically is a character class</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Eero: please reconsider</blockquote>\nHmm\u2026    Hm\u2026\u2026Hmmmmm\u2026\u2026\u2026<br/><br/>Ok, <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> I\u2019d say probably yes, best not to BUT, if you follow the logic of the discussion above about narrowly-defined non-human races, then, given the stereotyping of the female of our species throughout most of history, the idea of having \u2018woman\u2019 as a character class/archetype is perfectly logical. However, it all depends on who the designer is. If they\u2019re a well-known racist, sexist, homophobic bigot, then clearly the designating of \u2018woman\u2019 as an archetype would be extremely problematic, and for me at least a complete deal-breaker.

(Am I allowed, given that my other posts in the thread were from before the SD?).<br/><br/>I think one way of reconciling the need to represent fantasy races other than in a crassly simplistic and broad brush manner, and the need for clarity in a game, is to have a race- let's call them the Narbok- who <i>outwardly</i> present as cool, dispassionate, unemotional and unbending, but behind the facade there are rebels, misfits, outcasts and outlaws etc. who exhibit more nuanced characteristics, and who you occasionally encounter during your travels throughout the gameworld, but whose existence is vigorously denied by the ruling majority. I'm sure there <i>are</i> examples of this kind of approach in some games, I just can't think of any offhand.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424741/#Comment_424741" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-24T14:59:10+00:00" title="November 24, 2013  2:59PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2013 3:10PM by 2097.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just as an aside, the string "race" in this context is unfortunate given the polysemic usages of the same letter-sequence in recent human history and it's strange that games still use it.

They don't have the exact same jobs or fictional niches as humans.<br/><br/>Looking at Chewbacca or Gimli as metaphors for types of humans, on the other hand -- yes, I can see that there might be a very strong case for that, given the time the pulps flourished in, but that would make me not want to play the game. So given that as a basis, it's already pretty moot (for me personally) whether or not they should be split or not since we'd be discussing a game I don't want to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ToddSpengo" title="ToddSpengo"><img alt="ToddSpengo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ToddSpengo">ToddSpengo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424742/#Comment_424742" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-24T15:07:53+00:00" title="November 24, 2013  3:07PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Specifically, the string "race" in this context is unfortunate given the polysemic usages of the same letter-sequence in recent human history and it's strange that games still use it.

If it were looked at as the adjective, "of or pertaining to the races of humankind," we're left with a "demi-human" being human, either "half" or "lesser" as your campaign would socially identify. Elves would be humans crossed with forest spirits... maybe even changelings. Dwarves would be human but crossed with earth elementals. Halflings would be humans crossed with half... erm... things.<br/><br/>Maybe that's why these demi-humans party up with human folk. They want validation but keep getting kicked aside. Naturally, the demi-human cultures become defensive and shun the humans at every turn. The humans, thinking everything is just fine, are upset because the elves are always so snooty and the dwarves keep all the gold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_424745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424745/#Comment_424745" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-24T15:53:23+00:00" title="November 24, 2013  3:53PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2013 3:54PM by contracycle.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games aren't the only place this happens; Star Trek, for example, although having every possible reason to use species, frequently refers to race.  I suggest it's become a widely used term, for good or ill, in any context which makes a thing of having lots of weird and wonderful "types of people".<br/><br/>Indeed, with a slight squint it's possible to see the division of race from class as being a negative thing in its own right.  It presents a model of <i>tolerance</i>; sure you have a bar in which elves and dwarves and humans mingle, and it all looks happy enough, but what it's also doing is asserting that if people look different then they really are different.  Maybe this isn't not supposed to provoke any animosity and all such difference is "tolerated", but to tolerate something implies that it is in some way provocative or disturbing but which you must make an effort to accept.  That's actually quite different to seeing a universal humanity in which differences (in the real world) are trivial and insignificant.<br/><br/>As such, I don't think that the splitting of class from race really does lead to a better arrangement, and my approach has instead been to sidestep the apparently insoluble probem and use human-only settings.  The only other way, I think, would be to put elves and dwarves and whatnot back into the realm of "monsters", genuinely supernatural, alien beings.  None of this, however, is fantasy-as-we-know-it (although it is arguably quite good <i>Sword &amp; Sorcery</i>).<br/><br/>Or, you just have to day fuck it, my game is not intended to say anything about the. real world, it is should not be read too deeply and over-analysed, it is just a bunch of genre conventions strung together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424749/#Comment_424749" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-24T17:53:15+00:00" title="November 24, 2013  5:53PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Burning Wheel deserves credit for the stock thing, but also for the way it handles gender, specifically among humans.<br/><br/>There are a number of female-specific lifepaths, but there's no rule that those are the only LPs female characters can take (in fact, it's impossible, since there's no "Born Female" Born LP). So it manages to emphasize female gender roles in the medieval world, without in any way limiting the choices of players of female characters.<br/><br/>So if Eero's game works that way, where I can play, say, an investigator who happens to be female, *or* choose to play a character who emphasizes gender roles, that seems fine. But the other way is complete B.S.<br/><br/>As it happens, I kind of feel similarly about "race". I'm fine with Elf-specific Prestige Classes or whatever, but dislike, in general, the idea of all Elves being the same in terms of abilities.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div

(and goes on to list various classes and mentions half-elves and rules for non-human thieves and psionics) ... "However, for a beginning campaign these additions are not necessary, <i>and players should accustom themselves to regular play before adding further complexities</i>."  It then immediately says how, at the DM's discretion, a character can be anything the player wants; a centaur, a lawful were-bear, a Samurai.<br/><br/>  So, race-as-class seems to be a learning curve tool. Make a character, engage the dungeon. Be whatever you want - just don't expect to find any rules for it here. More rules forth-coming. <br/><br/>  And they just kept coming - and coming - and coming!  Did anybody else read the Ecology of the Piercer in Dragon magazine? Anyone? Come on, I can't be the only one who has seen a piercer rectum! More Rules! More Classes! More PC Races! More Powers/Skills/Feats/Abilities!

Likewise a Dwarf Cleric would just be a cleric, etc.  Heck I'm ok with changing it up and allowing a Human that wants to be a Fighter/Magicuser to take the Elf class.   Really in my mind classes are archetypes not professions.  <br/><br/>Of course the other option is that just like with Humans we dont have classes based on shepherds or merchants because they dont go adventuring with Dwarves and Elves etc the types that do go adventuring tend to have these class features and abilities, give them whatever background you like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424791/#Comment_424791" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-25T15:17:49+00:00" title="November 25, 2013  3:17PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think race-as-class works best when you want to emphasize that race's unique approach to combat, magic, or what have you. If dwarves are just fighters with a saving throw bonus, you don't need to worry about it. But when, say, elves uniquely combine the abilities of fighting-men and magic-users, and have unique rules for how they progress in both of those skill sets, it helps to treat them as a distinct class. Ditto when you want to emphasize the guerrilla aspect of halflings, or what have you.<br/><br/>I think ACKS does this aspect of race-as-class really effectively. Dwarves aren't fighters and clerics and thieves, they're vaultguards and craftpriests and delvers. In the ACKS context, demihuman racial limits also have a demographic meaning, and they have implications for how large demihuman domains can be.<br/><br/>Keeping them separate is good when you want to treat each race's approach to classes as a matter of combining general skill sets.

However, I don't think there is really a binary truth of whether fantasy races are really "mechanical racism". I think fantasy races unquestionably do comment on real-world races, but I don't think it is as simple as that they are definitely are or are not bad racism. I think the more interesting question is how to get more variations in how things like race and gender are handled. I had an old essay on this on my blog: <br/><br/><a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/76095.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/76095.html</a><br/><br/>I think it is more interesting to try out more varied ways to handle fantasy characters. Analyses can go back and forth over what it means, but it is easier to see things when you try out alternatives. <br/><br/>Notably, I tried out Sagas of the Icelanders twice now with its gendered character playbooks, and a few more times Monsterhearts with its mainly species-based playbooks. I'm now pondering different ways of handling these.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424843/#Comment_424843" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-26T16:26:14+00:00" title="November 26, 2013  4:26PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2013 4:33PM by James_Fleming.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not a big fan of Race and Class for the blandness and generality reason. It works, I suppose, if dwarfs and elves are meant to be the last of their dwindling kind, and so those that do adventure follow a very distinct set of principles (and perhaps, indeed, their rigid sticking to tradition could be a neat campaign mover for why they are dying out) but it makes them seem monocultural. All elves are x. <br/>For a similar reason, I'm not a big fan of the D&amp;D racial ability bonuses where all elves are nimble and wise, but not so strong. It also, I feel, limits the (Although I really dig the 13th Age, which has an interesting perspective of that mechanic. One ability bonus(from a choice, often one physical and one mental) and a trait is given to the race, then one is given by class from a choice, to represent training.) <br/>I also quite like the ACKS, which does give the races a mechanical cultural distinction, which can be built on in play. I discussed a similar method for a low-ish fantasy earth analogy setting, too, with a set of core classes (Fighter/Rogue/Mage/Priest/Minstrel) that could only be actually taken within cultural archetypes, and so worked very differently (Such as Bard/Skald/Rhapsode/Ashik).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424851/#Comment_424851" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-26T20:12:02+00:00" title="November 26, 2013  8:12PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I think it is more interesting to try out more varied ways to handle fantasy characters.

I\u2019m just saying that it does not make sense to me to say both !p and q.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425217/#Comment_425217" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T11:30:11+00:00" title="December  4, 2013 11:30AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanical differences between races can certainly be troubling. But Race as Class reinforces the idea that the "other" is inherently and unchangably defined by their otherness. <br/><br/>Loose analogy. <br/><br/>In a game modeled on the 18th Century Real World using culture as a race substitute. <br/><br/>A game in which all Characters of the European Culture got a +2 to Mechanics and all characters of the Native American culture got a +2 to Wilderness would be squicky, but I'd take a look at how the game handled the other issues before deciding. <br/><br/>A game in which characters of European Culture got to choose between 5 different classes, but all Native Americans had the same pre defined stats would have a much bigger strike against it. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425219/#Comment_425219" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T12:06:54+00:00" title="December  4, 2013 12:06PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2013 12:07PM by catty_big.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A game in which characters of European Culture got to choose between 5 different classes, but all Native Americans had the same pre defined stats would have a much bigger strike against it.</blockquote>\nThis is what I was talking about earlier when I alluded to the shallowness of the Star Trek races (<i>all</i> Klingons are warlike, <i>all</i> Ferengi are grasping, <i>all</i> Vulcans supress their emotions etc.), compared to the complexity of humans in the same universe.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19019/slow-down-osr-lets-talk-about-race-as-class" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19019/slow-down-osr-lets-talk-about-race-as-class" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19019/slow-down-osr-lets-talk-about-race-as-class/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19019%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19019%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
