The game is a good read, but there's a lot of rules and I wasn't sure if I got the whole thing.  But let's be honest; <b>once the monkeys were unleashed</b>, nothing could stop this steam train of awesome.<br/><br/>Our Sons of Liberty were:<br/><br/><b>John Hancock</b><br/><i>I have a hand of five cards when spending money<br/>I can draw a new hand when on the run<br/>I can claim a joker when with Paul Revere<br/>I can, when signing his name, call for diamond cards<br/>I can always play single spade cards</i><br/><br/><b>Fanny Campbell, female pirate captain</b><br/><i>I have a hand of five cards when disguised as a man<br/>I can draw a new hand when manipulating the system<br/>I can claim a joker when rescuing<br/>I can, when signing stealing British assets, call for spade cards<br/>I can always play single club cards</i><br/><br/><b>Paul Revere</b><br/><i>I have a hand of five cards when riding<br/>I can draw a new hand when tinkering<br/>I can claim a joker when raising the alarm<br/>I can, when asking others to trust him, call for diamond cards<br/>I can always play single club cards</i><br/><br/><b>Deborah "David" Sampson</b><br/><i>I have a hand of five cards when with Paul Revere<br/>I can draw a new hand when making do<br/>I can claim a joker when disguised as a man<br/>I can, when in combat, call for heart cards<br/>I can always play single club cards</i><br/><br/><br/><b>Travel Hand</b><br/>The Patriots started their trek from the Grand Lodge in <i>New Jersey</i> to <i>Bunker Hill</i> to meet the correspondant.<br/><br/>I played the Tories, choosing as my first Tory Figure, <b>Major John Andre</b>, Head of British Intelligence.<br/><br/>Major Andre found out the Patriots travel plans and set up a series of checkpoints on the road from New Jersey from Bunker Hill, searching the colonists' baggage and confiscating all sorts of weapons.  The Patriots had a slow start with their hands, and I followed up by narrating a box hidden in the trees overlooking the road.  The box had a hole cut in it so the <b>sketch artist monkey inside</b> could make accurate drawings of who was passing through the checkpoints.  The monkey suddenly jumped down and ran a drawing of Fanny Campbell (in men's clothing) over to Major Andre with a note at the bottom saying "that's no man!"<br/><br/>Trust me when I say I set a precedent for weirdness that just kept going and going.  At one point Deborah Sampson (dressed as a man) kissed Fanny Campbell (also dressed as a man), and Major Andre instituted a "Gay Tax".<br/><br/>The Patriots won the Travel Hand, but just barely.<br/><br/><br/><b>Opportune Objective <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a></b><br/>"The Sons of Liberty can <i>monkeywrench an ornithopter while</i> the British <i>replace supporters</i>!"<br/><br/>My Tory figure for this objective was:<br/><b>General Cornwallis</b>, savvy tactician<br/>He can <i>Deny Safety</i> for a New Hand <br/>He can <i>Deny Supplies</i> to Lock Jacks<br/><br/>I am a little faint on this part of the game.  But I seem to remember my surveillance monkey getting replaced with a mechanical Patriot monkey.  And then suddenly there were many mechanical monkeys.  I think I remember John Hancock getting thrown in jail and then signing his name to a get out of jail free card.  And the tables were turned on General Cornwallis who was thrown in jail and was going to be put on trial for...something.<br/><br/>The Patriots kicked my ass in this hand.<br/><br/><br/><b>Opportune Objective <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a></b><br/>"The Sons of Liberty can <i>inspire a lawyer while</i> the British <i>dissemble colonists</i>!"<br/><br/>My Tory figure for this objective was:<br/><b>General Henry Clinton</b>, Commander-in-Chief<br/>He can use <i>Tory Connections</i> to Steal a Queen<br/>He can <i>Take Command</i> for a New Hand<br/> <br/>I got a crappy hand, so I narrated General Clinton flying into Bunker Hill in his personal zeppelin (to the strains of Led Zeppelin) to take command of his troops.  All sorts of mayhem took over at this point, and I could barely follow the story.  I seem to remember installing a mechanical metal detector into the entrance of the courthouse to deprive the Patriots of their weapons.  And Deborah Sampson got put in the stocks, but slipped away and was replaced by an automaton by the time Cornwallis came outside to give her 50 lashes with the whip.  Cornwallis had stocked the jury with Tory sympathizers, but of course this plan was fooled by the Patriots as well.<br/><br/>I got my ass handed to me this hand as well.<br/><br/>(cont in the next post)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154782/#Comment_154782" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-04T00:05:33+00:00" title="July  4, 2008 12:05AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2008 12:09AM by Caesar_X.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cont)<br/><br/>We were running a little short on time, so we decided to move straight to the <br/><b>Primary Objective</b> <br/>"The Sons of Liberty must <i>dissemble a Liberty Tree lest</i> the British <i>deliver a sailing ship</i>!<br/><br/>My Tory figure for this objective was:<br/><b>Major Banastre Tarleton</b>, Psychopath with an Army<br/>He can use <i>Excessive Force</i> to Block Spades<br/>He can <i>Slaughter Civilians</i> fto Lock 8s<br/><br/>Major Tarleton was not screwing around as he drove into Bunker Hill in his steam-carriage bristling with blunderbusses, which boomed to clear the colonists out of the roadway.  I seem to remember the Major banning trees, so the Patriots dug up "Liberty Saplings" all over the land in order to build a sailing ship to defeat the British.  Major Tarleton's balloons unleashed a torrent of clockwork spiders across the land.  King George the III appeared in the skies in his airship.  And that's when Paul Revere <b>ran all the way across the Atlantic Ocean</b> to appear in Parliament and announce the British government as not having a King and thus being null and void.  Luckily Major Tarleton's hovercraft beat Paul Revere back to the colonies and was able to warn the Tories.<br/><br/>The Patriot players absolutely destroyed me this hand, and they were nice enough to give King George back to the British in exchange for <b>leaving the colonies the hell alone</b>.  Oh, and Fanny Campbell had herself instituted as Prime Minister of England.<br/><br/><br/><b>Thoughts</b><br/>I'm sure we didn't play 100% by the rules, as I didn't really understand the Tyranny points.  And everyone was on the honor system for using their Patriot favored circumstances, because I certainly couldn't follow it all.<br/><br/>But make no mistake, this game is crazy and <b>fun as all hell</b>.<br/><br/>I suggest you run, not walk to your FLGS and buy this game now.  Or else those damn Patriots will unleash a horde of mechanical monkeys on you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154785/#Comment_154785" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-04T00:28:05+00:00" title="July  4, 2008 12:28AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wha'?
