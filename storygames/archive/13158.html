Fighting and Magic!<br/>Back in the old days, we asked the question, "Why does every rule set inexplicably have rules for drowning and for falling, even if these things really don't come up that often?" Nowadays we ask highfalutin' questions like "why are there separate rules for fighting? Or for magic?"<br/><br/>My answer to this is a game in which every scene must have a fight OR spell-casting in it (or both). Essentially, every single conflict must be resolved by fighting, or by casting magic spells. <br/><br/>That's all I got. Does that strike anyone else the way it strikes me?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296394/#Comment_296394" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-09T22:38:01+00:00" title="October  9, 2010 10:38PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2010 10:38PM by jason.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Knee-jerk response: We already have D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Though, in D&amp;D, casting magic spells is really just a different way to fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296435/#Comment_296435" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-10T13:58:56+00:00" title="October 10, 2010  1:58PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2010 1:59PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe the game is just called BUT NOT FIGHTING, and it has rules for everything but fighting.

I'm imagining a game with cons on probation, or just a situation in which all characters on-stage are effectively immortal.

The idea was that the players were Knights in service to the King, who would give them the most horribly mundane tasks he could possibly think of to try and keep them out of trouble. It was then the Knights' job to solve that task... but could only use violence to do so. The 'puzzle solving' in the game was mainly in how to use violence to solve tasks like unblocking the toilet, going down to the pub for a packet of dry-roasted peanuts, or making a birthday cake for the princess.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296479/#Comment_296479" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T08:08:33+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  8:08AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Ash, I remember that game!

In fact, the title would maybe allude to fighting and spell-casting, but the game itself wouldn't even mention either of those topics until, y'know, chaper 8 and chapter 9 (rules for fighting and rules for magic). At that point the game would inform the reader that every scene must include either or both. <br/><br/>Possible settings: <br/><br/>Bookish Canadian middle-school children on a school exchange in Switzerland.<br/>Caregivers working in an understaffed special-needs adult home.<br/>A strategic work-together-against-the-system game about any simple-to-describe job, ie city garbage collection.<br/><br/>Maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
