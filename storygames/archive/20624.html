But I didn't want to complicate rules unnecessarily so I tried several different approaches and used some google-fu to see what cool combat systems were out there. I ended up finding some really cool stuff I hadn't thought of, or at list, didn't paid enough attention before and now I'm seeing it in a different light.<br/><br/>For example this advice, found <a href="http://sinisterdesign.net/12-ways-to-improve-turn-based-rpg-combat-systems/" rel="nofollow">here</a>\n<blockquote><br/>(1) Use space. Adding a spatial dimension to combat increases its complexity exponentially without making it substantially harder for the player to understand. Most people have played  games like Candyland or Monopoly, to say nothing of Checkers and Chess. Everyone (even your mom) intuitively understands the concept of moving pieces between spaces.<br/><br/>By using space in your battles, you add a new dimension to combat both figuratively and literally: the concept of attack range comes into play, and the player gains direct control of actions like fleeing and protecting weaker characters behind stronger ones.</blockquote>\nWhich got me thinking into giving elemental mages a number of markers equal to their elemental magic skill level, that they can place over the grid and move to create the effect of terrain control. Using ice? You can pile up those markers to make a tower or walls, give cover to your allies, throw them at your opponents, etc. Range at which you can use this abilitie again depends on how much levels you have on the elemental magic skill.Totally intuitive to use and doesn't require much explanation, yet increases the tactical component.<br/><br/>Then I found this<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/261698/7_combat_systems_that_every_game_designer_should_study.php" rel="nofollow"> other article</a> and went to analyze <i>Guilty Gear Xrd</i> gameplay. I didn't knew sidescrolling fighting games were already reaching this complexity. Ok, too much of the stuff from this game would require tons of additional rules, but things like the <i>tension</i> bar got me thinking.<br/><br/>So, I ended up with my old 2d6+skill system, but then you can get bonus dice to replace bad rolls, add them to the damage or make additional actions. The bonus dice come from two sources, one is your own daily allotment and the other a communal pool of dice. From the latter, you can only pick one die and give it to another player when you're doing something to give them support, like tanking, flanking, distracting the opponent, etc.<br/><br/>This morning I went to analyze Devil May Cry and notices how explicitly the designers added an obvious danger on the stage, but not too much to threat you character as to give you a chance to use it against your enemies. Sure, we all have used the trap or abyss close to the battleground to add tension to the game, but most of the time as GMs we found out players ended up using it to dispose of important NPCs and then stopped using them, at least for final fights. Why shouldn't things like this see more use in specific ways?<br/><br/>Well, I'm almost done with the basics of my game, but I think I'll definitely keep looking at videogames for inspiration, despite not everything can be translated quite well to boardgames, as it's a fine inspiration source. So please, if you have more stuff about videogame design that you find interesting and feel can be applied to tabletop RPGs please share it here!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452729/#Comment_452729" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T23:22:20+00:00" title="April 27, 2016 11:22PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting ideas!<br/>I have to say, I am more on the narrative side of the rpg spectrum and don't care too much for combat grids and stuff like that.<br/>But I've been poaching ideas and concepts like crazy from the "Extra Credits" series of vlogs for one of my games, and I sure will do it again in the future.<br/>It's a golden mine of game design, and most concepts I see could be somehow ported from videogames to tabletop rpgs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452745/#Comment_452745" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-28T17:35:52+00:00" title="April 28, 2016  5:35PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I was actually looking for anything that could me help model combat in a mechanical way with the less amount of rules and more open variables, yet add a tactical component easy to learn but hard to master... because heck, I want more roleplaying moments in combat.<br/><br/>I ended up using a mechanic where to beat a challenge is more useful to support another player to give her extra dice, something that can be done in lots of ways besides rolling dice. Like, old D&amp;D flanking, for example. So I included Tanking, a concept more used in online RPGs where a character draws the aggro of the enemy and keeps it busy, while all the other ones cast spells or make ranged attacks. <br/><br/>The mechanic in my game then became like this: you can give a dice to another character if you interpose between her and the enemy. Yes, you will soak any damage directed at her<i> if</i> the worst happens, but until then you don't need to roll dice or waste an action to give support.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452770/#Comment_452770" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T06:59:40+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  6:59AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, but I just don't get one thing...\n<blockquote>I want more roleplaying moments in combat.<br/>[...]<br/>you can give a dice to another character if you interpose between her and the enemy</blockquote>\nNow I'm all in favor of a boardgame-y and fun to play combat sub-game.<br/>But I just don't see the connection between your first statement, and the rule you then describe.<br/>Or the rule about using a combat grid and "elemental tokens" to represent terrain manipulations.<br/><br/>I say this not just to criticize, but to try and understand.<br/>One of my current projects is all about dungeon crawling (of which combat is an important element) but I am trying to produce a system that is mainly fiction-based but somehow feels a bit tactical, and also pretty challenging.<br/>(oh and it has to work in a gmLess way, because personal obsession :P )<br/><br/>Obviously I'm having some difficulties, and am therefore very interested in other people solutions and ideas <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452804/#Comment_452804" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T20:17:35+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  8:17PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All right, allow me to explain further!<br/><br/>By "more roleplaying moments" now that I'm thinking it better I actually meant a mix of "mechanics that produce story-like details" and having players react to those and roleplay it. My bad, I phrased it in a terrible way when I didn't even had the whole concept clear in my head.<br/><br/>So, while practically every RPG uses a mechanic to represent how chances or effects of actions improve when two players collaborate, I've only recently been exposed to a game where this collaboration is crucial to overcome the game challenges. It was a friend's design and I totally loved the effect it produced. <br/><br/>Before this game, on other campaigns with other systems we often focused more on our character tactics instead of our group tactics, since there were more options for the characters operating alone and we felt that fighting alongside each other meant fighting together.<br/><br/>So now I went to try and put more variables to empower that atmosphere. Method is somewhat like this: First, by design, the difficulty of the challenge is graduated in a way that no PC alone can face it. Then, the mechanics come into play by giving each player the chance to make their action <i>and</i> do something else to support another player. That support ends up being represented by the player giving a dice from a common pool to the player supported, which can be used in different ways depending on how is built the character and his specialty.<br/><br/>For example, a powerful character can do more damage, but the character can be either a mage, a thug, a warrior, a martial artist, etc. A dexterous one can use those dice to make more attacks, a fast one can move further, etc. While each PC has a personal pool of dice to use in the same ways, this pool doesn't recharge until the PC rests, so supporting the best positioned and more suited PC for the task soon becomes the best tactic. The group can tank small opponents and distract their boss until the mage has enough dice to make a barrage of fast attacks and free everyone to get to the boss later. Or they may buy time for the archer to focus and headshot the boss. A gunslinger may provide suppressive fire while the frontliner cover the distance and charge with a mighty blow towards the enemy, etc, all with the same basic mechanic.<br/><br/>While all this isn't something that doesn't already happen in RPGs, it requires players to be in the particular "teamwork mindset" (which honestly, my group didn't experienced this deeply until my friend's game), so I'm using the system to empower this aspect a bit more. I'm still giving finishing touches to the rest of the game for playtesting, so I can't tell for sure how will exactly work, but I feel it has some  potential.<br/><br/>In the case of elemental tokens, it would be best if they were cubes or anything that can not only be lined, but piled up to incorporate height to the spatial representation. It's more intuitive to have a pile of blocks you can use to represent how your earth magic allows you to create a stone tower under your feet to gain elevated terrain advantage for your next attack, and then crumble it upon your foes. Otherwise you would have to implement a set of rules to describe this effect, another set to define how you can create walls, etc, etc. Instead I'm giving the pile to the player to use as she sees fit and logical. If she can do it with the blocks, the character can do it with it's magic. All this means less rules to check and remember and more time to roleplay, besides of more tactical depth.<br/><br/>Good luck with making it GMless! I've tried it before and while I do consider it doable, I ended up finding in the process a way of GMing with full impro, using player ideas and building upon them in a way that I like better than going full GMless, as it's almost zero effort on my part. What kind of difficulties are you having? I may have ideas to help you solve some of those.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452811/#Comment_452811" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-30T08:02:41+00:00" title="April 30, 2016  8:02AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gamasutra is a video gaming site with news and blogs.

Every weapon maneuver leaves you vulnerable in some way, protected in another way. A <i>big</i> part of the game is predicting enemy attacks and compensating accordingly. In practice, rpg combat that gets too granular is a headache, but the idea of exploiting openings and weaknesses turn by turn is fun. Combat is never just the dreaded 'hack and slash,' it retains deep tactics on a very small scale ('duck to avoid the claw, roll in and slash the leg' as opposed to, say, 'don't let the squadron get flanked')<br/><br/>Also, every weapon handles differently and the playstyle is substantially different for each. More than getting just +1 defense from a shield, the shield actively changes the way you play. This could be modeled by your <b>weapons opening up new Moves</b>, as opposed to granting bonuses.<br/><br/>Next, <b>your inventory is incredibly important</b>. You have limited slots for utility items (smoke bombs, potions, etc) and the more you bring with you the less 'loot' you can carry back. These days it's en vogue to handwave the inventory bookkeeping, but games like Torchbearer successfully make your carrying capacity a legitimate choice.<br/><br/>Finally, the game has <b>rewards that directly represent your accomplishments</b>. The premise of Monster Hunter is <i>Kill Giant Monster, Make Armor From Its Hide</i>. Very rarely do tabletop games do this. After a battle, loot is collected, sure, but it's loot that is only tangentially related to your fighting prowess. In Monster Hunter, you get to wear Red Dragonscale Armor because you hunted many Red Dragons. It's obviously satisfying to earn a mechanical bonus, but it also serves as a very tangible reminder of your past accomplishments (plus bragging rights! always important).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452863/#Comment_452863" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-02T17:45:07+00:00" title="May  2, 2016  5:45PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2016 11:10PM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks a lot for the link Rickard! I think I'll dig on the articles you commented for a while.<br/>And you're right Scrape, I just checked one gameplay video of Monster Hunter before, but now you got me really interested on how it handles weapons.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>Ok, I've been investigating how Monster Hunter works and I still have a lot to go through, but so far  I get the <i>getting too granular</i> problem. Things like a Sharpness stat that acts as a multiplier that can augment or reduce the damage output of the weapon are cool but doesn't have to be modeled that way to see use in a tabletop game. You can perfectly include a critical fumble table where one of the possibilities is that "your weapon loses it's sharpness, -1 to damage" to get the same gameplay effect.<br/><br/>A great part of the deal of taking advantage of videogames is that <i>you don't need your model to be exactly like the one the videogame is using</i> but just to make the same fun things happen in your tabletop game.<br/><br/>So well, I won't model weapons to work exactly like the MH game in mine, but I do like the concept of having weapons opening different opportunities at the exchange of accepting different risks. I'm setting a list of tags for advantages and disadvantages and giving the weapons a price according the amount of tags they have. Also, I'm definitely adding a reach stat to determine who gets to act first when attacking or defending on the same conditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455634/#Comment_455634" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-17T17:26:38+00:00" title="August 17, 2016  5:26PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2016 5:26PM by Rickard.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2EQim6AnQRgIBuYsDlwCDQ" rel="nofollow">Game Whisperer</a> is a video game theory vlog from a guy working on Ubisoft.
