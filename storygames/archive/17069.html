The idea is that you wear a ribbon, at conventions, to show you're available for support if anyone gets harassed.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.backupproject.org/" rel="nofollow">Back up project</a><br/><br/>And here's the Dragon*Con announcement:<br/><br/><a href="http://dragoncon.livejournal.com/2953722.html" rel="nofollow">Dragon*Con</a><br/><br/>I think this matters. Campaigns about convention harassment have been growing in profile recently and this is a major test of them. By my reading, Dragon*Con have smacked it down heavily ("Quite frankly, scary to us...We have asked the individual to stop providing ribbons").<br/><br/>If you are going and you disagree with their position, you might consider dropping them a line. This is the sort of thing that can be changed, if enough people express an opinion. Their contact details, which I've taken straight from their website, are:<br/><br/>Email: dragoncon@dragoncon.org <br/>Phone: 770-909-0115 (M-F 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. EST) <br/><br/>I'm also interested to hear your thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387626/#Comment_387626" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T06:00:39+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  6:00AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2012 6:01AM by David Artman.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah...

There's one person's somewhat vague/bombastic post in the first answer, and then the question is begged in the third answer. OK, "groping without moaning" is one qualifier--granted.<br/><br/>Without a clear definition of the behaviors which will trigger them to butt in/back up, this is a serious landmine. And without the right people involved and organizing it (e.g., Community Watch organizations are coordinated with and--to an extent--trained by the police), you're guaranteed to step on at least a few of those mines.<br/><br/>On the one hand, you've got escalation of conflict by amateurs untrained in conflict management... or worse, amateurs untrained in conflict management but trained in martial arts... and with potentially lethal weaponry on hand! And before you say "WTF" to that, recall the number of "cosplayers" who show up as fully packing SWAT or Spec Ops dudes, except for the Airsoft gun (i.e., real combat knives, real combat boots). Now recall the number who carry perfectly functional swords and daggers (peace-binding be damned).<br/><br/>On the other, you've got the risk of misreading a situation and being an ass. Yes, I'd rather err on this side, too--but how many miscues will an individual be willing to make before reactivating the SEP field? Or before the individual is the one talking to security/police, instead of suspected perps?<br/><br/>And on the gripping hand, some of the verbiage of the FAQ suggests that these enforcers will gang up, as necessary--calling over friends to help. Awesome. Hope the perp doesn't have more, bigger friends with similar ethics as him. "Groping without moaning" becomes a gang fight amidst otherwise-innocent con goers.<br/><br/>No matter how it's sliced and diced, it's vigilantism in venues where there are at least two recourses: calling venue security over or calling in the police/sheriff. Vigilantism by amateur volunteers who have a thing for heroes, no less....<br/>-----<br/>I would love to see trained law enforcement officers and even maybe social workers volunteering for such roles at cons, for sure! Coordinating with venue security and local law enforcement. Using known-good techniques for both recognition and containment of conflicts.

I'm really concerned about common hyper-vigilance as Dave notes, but this project looks really solid: It's not encouraging people to punch others. Given that it has men as an <b><i>auxiliary team</i></b> and clearly explains why (which I think also diffuses that situation; as long as testosterone-heavy dudes actually read the FAQ and actually ACT/LIVE by it), and the fact that it's leaderless/diffused and not promoting someone's specific agenda, it's a worthwhile effort.<br/><br/>Looks like DragonCon says "we can't support this officially; we won't tell you to stop, either". <br/><br/>And thatwordgrrl's response is excellent:<br/>=-=-=-=-=<br/>Just to be clear -- as per discussion with the Dragon*Con concom, this post will be linked on the Backup Ribbon Project website, as well as on its Twitter feed. We feel it is only fair to Dragon*Con attendees why may have ribbons to know the concom's position on on this. At this point, to our understanding, Dragon*Con will NOT be imposing sanctions on those who wear or distribute Backup Ribbons, nor will the ribbons be confiscated.<br/><br/>The Backup Ribbon Project, after discussion with the Dragon*Con concom, will NOT be targeting its message to any specific con/event. In essence, if you feel there is a need for ribbons at an event, that is all we care about. We do not ask for what event and we do not track that information. <br/><br/>While we appreciate the concerns of the Dragon*Con concom, we believe the value of making the Backup Ribbon Project accessible to as many people as possible outweighs the possible risk of a few bad apples. We are certainly open to discussion on this matter, via our website. <br/><br/>We would also ask that if there is an unfortunate incident of somebody with a Backup Ribbon taking advantage of the situation to please let us know. <br/><br/><b>Our goal in this is NOT to replace the con's security efforts, but merely to add to it and give fans a way to help each other out.</b><br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>The Backup Ribbon Project<br/>=-=-=-=-=<br/><br/>I think that last bit explains the crux of the issue. I think Dragon*Con's scare-scenario is far-fetched ("what if someone puts this pillow IN THEIR EYE?

I saw tons of sausage being made at Otakon. While it had maybe 10,000 less people, it had Cosplay EVERYWHERE, making things more potentially problematic. But from what I've seen they did not skimp on security and staff to evaluate and judge harassment:they had a whole area set up which looked like a futuristic court system (called "THE AREA OF <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO</span>"), staffed by women and men with (if I heard correctly) real legal experience.</sup> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387687/#Comment_387687" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T13:10:22+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  1:10PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2012 1:22PM by Mcdaldno.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On the one hand, you've got escalation of conflict by amateurs untrained in conflict management... or worse, amateurs untrained in conflict management but trained in martial arts... and with potentially lethal weaponry on hand! And before you say "WTF" to that, recall the number of "cosplayers" who show up as fully packing SWAT or Spec Ops dudes, except for the Airsoft gun (i.e., real combat knives, real combat boots). Now recall the number who carry perfectly functional swords and daggers (peace-binding be damned).<br/><br/>On the other, you've got the risk of misreading a situation and being an ass. Yes, I'd rather err on this side, too--but how many miscues will an individual be willing to make before reactivating the SEP field? Or before the individual is the one talking to security/police, instead of suspected perps?</blockquote>\nHey David,<br/><br/>I don't think the Backup Ribbon project really asks its supporters to do conflict management, just conflict detection. This is a common strategy in responding to sexual harassment: be present, speak directly to anyone you feel might be being harassed, make sure everyone feels safe. If it turns out that no, this person isn't feeling safe, and no, this other person isn't leaving or backing down, your responsibility isn't to chase this person away - it's to get an authority or additional support. Nobody's asked to be a hero, just to be there. A lot of the time, that's all that is needed - a third wheel that disrupts a victimization scheme.<br/><br/>It doesn't take making an ass out of yourself to intervene. "Hey, are you enjoying the show? Cool. Do you know this guy?" If the person's body language and response signal that they're totally comfortable and safe at present, then all you did was made some conversation. If the person's body language and response signal that they're uneasy, you can easily offer support in a non-intrusive way: "Do you want me to stick around for a bit?"<br/><br/>Lots of people don't need an orientation on how to step in, just a sense of permission.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387689/#Comment_387689" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T13:15:51+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  1:15PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And thatwordgrrl's response is excellent:<br/><b>Our goal in this is NOT to replace the con's security efforts, but merely to add to it and give fans a way to help each other out.</b></blockquote>This is the right attitude on the part of the Backup Ribbon Project. One possible option a con organizer could take is embrace the effort and reinforce it by giving them venue to get this message clearly explained. Not really for others, for those wearing a ribbon. <br/><br/>My personal take is, if they're going to keep your con safer then offer them a free food voucher for wearing the ribbon. Of course then people would be wearing the ribbon just to get free food which might make it not so good an idea (but it would raise awareness). Maybe to get the ribbon you need to sit through an orientation about the problem.<br/><br/>Yes, I realize this is a decentralized grass roots movement and that I'm way over thinking what they can or should do and their methods are probably easier and more effective. Oh well I'm trying to be helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
