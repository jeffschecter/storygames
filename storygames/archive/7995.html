You know, just have players make their skill checks normally, just treat the conditions of requiring a check and interpreting the results in a conflict resolution manner; basically like you'd do in Sorcerer. For example, when the characters have to get through a social situation, you don't <i>have to</i> put in a skill challenge - just ask the player to pick a suitable skill, perhaps run some support checks out of the other characters or other skills, and then have a single check to resolve whether the character gets what he wants out of the social situation. You don't actually have to switch the dicing and skill system of the game to make this work, and it barely touches upon the game balance - it might even improve, considering that individual skills are much better balanced when the player has some say in picking the skills to use.<br><br>To give this sort of approach some teeth, have failures cost Surges or, indeed, cause ability damage. The way I do this sort of thing in my own primitive D&amp;D campaign is to count off degrees of success in steps of five points - so missing a DC by five is a level 2 failure, that sort of thing. Degreeing that failure costs the degree in Surges would be a simple rule of thumb to use, and it's easy to change that in individual situations to better match how perilous the situation is. And, of course, you can narrate all sorts of adverse conditions instead of the Surge loss; more enemies to an incoming encounter, an extra hazard, closing off a route of approach and so on. Lots of options.<br><br>(Of course, successes give benefits of various sorts. In the context of 4th ed. you could give out information that allows the characters to avoid or weaken off encounters before the fight, for example - whatever basically was the stakes of the conflict is fine, I'd imagine. That's what conflict resolution is for, to determine why you're rolling the dice in the first place.)<br><br>I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have characters get removed from play without an actual fight in D&amp;D 4th. Actually, I think that it's probably a terrible idea - better to weaken the character and set him against a more difficult challenge, and then kill him off in the fight if he fails to escape or triumph despite the odds. D&amp;D is not happy with easily killed characters, chargen is so onerous. Also, sidelining the combat mechanics to kill a character in 4th ed. seems perilously close to cheating.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176812/#Comment_176812" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T13:27:47+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  1:27PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>\n<br/>\nVery wise words.

If I would, then I guess the baseline of negotiation for monsters and NPCs could be... I guess they don't do negative levels anymore? If it were 3rd edition, I'd give negative levels to the NPC equal to the degree of failure. Sounds pretty sweet, actually. 4th edition doesn't have anything similar off-hand, but perhaps simple hitpoint damage would suffice? The only powerful and ultimate conflict resolution system in D&amp;D is combat, and hitpoints are the primary resource for that, so it kinda makes sense to just leech that power from the characters as cost for all sorts of conflicts. If it needs to be justified somehow, call it "humiliation damage" or "losing focus" - no stranger than losing hitpoints for exhaustion out in the desert, after all. Shame somebody in front of his family, and he'll make stupid mistakes in the fight to come, costing him his life... The formula for determining how many hitpoints are lost could be something as simple as the difference in check results multiplied by any force multipliers that were brought to bear in the conflict - so it's just x1 for speaking unkindly to somebody, but x4 if you managed to make him lose his honor in front of his father, or something of the sort.<br><br>Of course, you could also make the default negotiation baseline be about benefits for the player characters instead of harm for the opponent. Heck, make the default benefit experience points, should put some zing into the players. "Take 200 xp for being cool or actually find the key you were looking for." Actually doesn't make any sense for the xp system as I understand it, though. In general, the negotiating idea is a bit of a problem in a game where you usually run the mechanics to overcome problems - if the player is rolling dice to get a door open, it's sort of weird to have the negotiation baseline be anything but getting that door open.<br><br>I just realized, by the way, that interestingly enough my brother Markku runs his 4th edition campaign with at least some negotiation systems similar to what you're proposing here. He's sort of big on indie stuff like you, and consequently wants to engage the players more with the game. For example, he had the characters travel through a dangerous forest and pretty much just suggested possible encounters to the players, trying to find out what sort of content the rest of the group would like. Instead of declaring a random encounter he'd ask the others if they'd like to fight with wolves now, that sort of stuff. I find this extremely ass-backward in something like D&amp;D (takes away the subgames and goal framework related to taking up a challenge), but perhaps it works for some groups.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176815/#Comment_176815" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T14:18:30+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  2:18PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2008 2:19PM by Ry.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Rust, I can probably help if I can rub two braincells together.

The part I missed on the first go-around was the notion that negotiation would be used to replace GM judgment. I don't know if it's a good idea, however, to put the judgment aspect into the negotiation pot, because the negotiation is essentially in-character priority shuffling, while the traditional GM judgment required in D&amp;D is objective world-running. Perhaps this is not a problem (if, for instance, you don't really care about the neutral, referee-controlled world at all), but if it is, then you'll want to distribute the authority on some other manner than conflict negotiation.<br><br>I've actually played a traditional rpg similar to D&amp;D without a GM, with distributed power. We made it work by leaning heavily on "reasonableness" (and by playing with a strictly simulationistic, agenda, I might add) in our decisionmaking: all the normal GM stuff was just narrated by whoever felt like it, and the others questioned it only when there were reasonable grounds for that. I don't know that a group without lots of harmony could do this sort of thing without more rules, though.<br><br>Also, about skill checks and such, I think you can make them interesting with a bit less drastic modifying of your technique. I'm just guessing here, but it seems to me that you're not staking your skill check situations with enough significance if they feel like distractions instead of a crucial part of the pre-combat maneuvers. When I call for skill checks (ability checks, actually, in my primitive D&amp;D campaign), it's <i>always</i>, without exception, to either resolve a challenge, provide (or not, in case of failure) the players with more information to make reasonable decisions, or to provide (or not, again) the players with resources or other advantage for overcoming a challenge to come. So it's all geared towards the challenges. Taking that to 4th edition, perhaps the skill checks wouldn't seem so useless if the difference between success and failure were in facing three orcs more in the in-coming fight?<br><br>(I should note that the sort of game I run deals with failure in this context by having the players make their own calls as to the pace and direction of their adventuring. One failure in the preparatory stage ability checks rarely leaves them with too little information or resources to encounter the challenge, but that call <i>has</i> to be made by them - I provide reasonable alternative courses of action, but if the players decide that they'll go into the dragon's cave despite screwing up their information gathering, resupplying, seeking allies and planning, that's on their heads and not mine.)<br><br>The idea of making failure interesting is a bit awkward for D&amp;D skill checks, by the way. Often enough that "interest" is something that messes with the flow of the challenge. Better to have the failures entail clear risks the players are aware of before making the check. For example, have the check cost time or money or other limited resources, and leave it up to the player whether he wants to make it. Or make the check determine who gets a surprise round in the in-coming combat. As long as the check has something real at stake, and the player has some basis on which to judge whether he wants to take the risk, I seem to have little trouble with it. I don't even need to balance the risk vs. reward in any way, because the player will certainly do that for me by refusing the deals that seem too hazardous. I might even say that it's the job of the player to do exactly this.<br><br>Anyway, that's just some more random thoughts. I can certainly sympathise with being frustrated by D&amp;D, I only managed to verbalize the basic principles of how to make the game work last winter.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176832/#Comment_176832" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T17:48:40+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  5:48PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rust</cite>Just playing 4e, failed skill checks generally results in distractions and frustrating obstacles before getting to the big fight.</blockquote>Sounds like the dice just get in your way outside of combat, so what you want to focus on is creating situations which the PCs explore.  In line with the old school document, my instinct would be to ban all the rolls outside of combat (or the immediate leadup to combat).  Keep a list of PC passive perception checks and vision abilities so you can be sure to describe things appropriately.  If your players trust your GMing this can work very well.<br><br>This would let you play non-combat obstacles aggressively; you know the parameters, and because they can't try to roll their way through it, working it out becomes essentially an extended negotiation with the GM.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176834/#Comment_176834" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T17:51:37+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  5:51PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rust</cite>I like how IAWA distributes the GM's power with the use of "negotiation with a stick."</blockquote>Maybe I don't understand this, actually.  That on its own doesn't distribute the GM's power; it just limits the degree the GM can ask for in a given conflict, and even that is tied in with the limits on the GM to play to the scenario in the Oracle.

I agree with it to a point, but part of 4e's power is the balanced combat challenge.  In the above instance, I don't think it is a balanced combat, which means I'm flushing the main compelling reason to play 4e down the toilet.  The XP reward does not include the pre-fight roll play.  So, I'd have to factor in other possibilities: If they win without the info do they get more XP? If they win with the info do they get less XP?<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted, I just drank a double mocha latte, and my brain is a bit freaking out now, so these are more quibbles than anything.
