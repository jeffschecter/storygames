I love how easy it is to hack and run Lady B!  A couple of questions came up, though, and I was wondering how other people would answer them...<br/><br/>1) Say you're playing in a group without a PC Snargle and the Captain wants to get all jiggy with the piloting.  Without Snargle, no PC has piloting traits or tags.  What do you do?  <br/><br/>In our case, we had previously established that Snargle was along as an NPC and so when our captain ordered evasive maneuvers, we let the captain use Snargle's traits with his own pool dice.  It didn't feel right to penalize the group or to remove cool skyship maneuver scenes because there's no Snargle.  But I was sorely tempted to say that when things are put in an NPC's hands that they're put into the GM's hands, and then conditions and escalation can flow from that.<br/><br/>2) We decided that players could trade XP for dice if they got excited about something and wanted to supercharge their pool.  Has anyone experimented with eliminating the XP / pool dice divide, and just awarding pool dice for hitting keys and then charging pool dice for advances?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310247/#Comment_310247" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T09:17:54+00:00" title="January 31, 2011  9:17AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Me, I would have made it a roll of the captain's command skills - "Can he convince Snargle to do something dangerous?"

This is something I borrowed from Microscope and 1001 Nights.  It makes refreshment scenes nice and short and one-shot friendly while keeping their conflict-contextualizing coolness.</blockquote>\njohnzo,  would you mind expanding on this?

The backstory is that the Jedi are sending an expedition to Franter's distant homeworld and they've paroled Franter so he can serve them as a guide.  Vaud needs to refresh, but we're running low on time, so we have to  be efficient.<br/><br/><b>Vaud</b>: My refresh scene is about when I first met Franter.  I pulled him out of the spice mines of Kessel.<br/><br/><b>GM</b>:  Did you have to bribe the warden?<br/><br/><b>Vaud</b>: Yes. <br/><br/><b>GM</b>: Do you have to bring Franter back to the mines?  Did you purchase his freedom or is he more like a library book?<br/><br/><b>Vaud</b>: (thinks for awhile).  Yes.  He has to go back  and serve his sentence.<br/><br/><b>GM</b>: What's at stake if you don't?<br/><br/><b>Vaud</b>: My good name as a Jedi.<br/><br/><b>Franter</b>: (profanity).

Hm. But most failures on the dice don't result in conditions. <br/><br/>This ties into a mild complaint of mine about Lady Blackbird - a lack of clarity, presumably in the interest of conserving space in the text. I think it's clear *enough* to make the game playable without much trouble, but there are spots that felt like they could use a touch-up. <br/><br/>I house-ruled that if you succeed by a margin of two or more, you get -1 difficulty on the next, related action. Kind of like Sorcerer. It felt too flat, or like the players were losing out, to do nothing with those extra successes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327829/#Comment_327829" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T14:27:15+00:00" title="June  5, 2011  2:27PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2011 2:30PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing with conditions is a separate thing from who describes the failure, as Zac pointed out.<br/><br/>But, yeah, Jamie, sorry, I should have said, "LB doesn't <i>specify</i> who narrates what." The group gets to decide how they do it (any way is fine for LB). So players can narrate their failures if that works for you -- it's not required, though. The only thing specified is that players get to say how they get a condition.<br/><br/>So, the GM chooses the condition, "Oh, so I think this makes you Angry, yeah?" and the player fills in the details. "Oh, yeah... I think I'll blame Snargle! Stupid goblin flipping the shacklin' boat all around while I'm trying to work!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
