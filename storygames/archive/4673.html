It reminds me of ... what's Scott McCloud call it? The thing where Tintin is almost featureless, to better our identification with him?<br/><br/>I can feel how the game would play. It'd play fun, cool, surreal, a little intense but always thoughtful. Meg would play it like <i>this</i>, Em like <i>this</i>, Joshua like <i>this</i>, Julia like <i>this</i>. Me like however I would. <br/><br/>The suspension of notice brings to it a different kind of immersion than we're used to, it's evident when I think about how Em would play it. Fun.<br/><br/>I like that it's when an issue has evolved up to very large, not to resolution, that the road is open. That's evocative. The issue rules overall are very good.<br/><br/><b>What I think is funny about Transantiago:</b><br/>It's funny that the movement rules take up so much pagespace, for being so simple. They're essential, though, so there they are.<br/><br/><b>What I wish about Transantiago:</b><br/>I wish that the watch thing had more explicit significance.<br/><br/>Here's me free-associating: whoever's watch says the earliest time, that's whose turn it is, right? This means that we've already seen events that, from this person's perspective, have yet to happen. a) It might be worth it to note down the times of significant, especially significant <i>weird</i>, events. As the other characters catch up with these, they can or can't experience them themselves, as called for. b) It's possible, at least in principle, for a person who gets a later turn to mess up causality for a person who's already taken their turn. This is excellent. I wouldn't try to prevent or mitigate this a bit.<br/><br/><b>What I wonder about Transantiago:</b><br/>How easy will it be for us to come up with, then grow, issues?  I have an answer, of course: easier for some of us than for others. What would help the people for whom it'll be less easy? Are they just on their own, good luck to them?<br/><br/>GMed or not, or what? You mention "the GM" just once in the text, which is either not nearly enough or one time too many.<br/><br/>Would characters-as-characters just naturally develop? Is it avoidable? It seems like a bad thing if they do - how would you, like, recover from it?<br/><br/>Along those lines, if I say, "I buy a newspaper at the little newsstand coffee-shop kiosk," is anyone allowed to say "your pockets are empty"? More generally, how does the suspension of notice reach into how my avatar and I deal with issues? Can I say "I perform CPR on her," or does that violate?<br/><br/>...But I guess that brings me to the space in the game where the rules don't exist yet.<br/><br/><b>What I'd suggest for Transantiago:</b><br/>Psi Run, Adventures in the Land of 1000 Kings, and Ganakagok. You may have already played all these, Jonathan, but if you haven't, you might find them informative. They might illuminate the place in Transantiago where the rules don't exist yet.<br/><br/>Also, what if each of us had our own deck of cards and a sharpie?<br/><br/><b>How I rate Transantiago:</b><br/>use of terms: <b>lively</b><br/>completeness: <b>near</b><br/>design qualities: <b>evocative, cue-light, nonviolent</b><br/>want to play: <b>enthusiastic</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105394/#Comment_105394" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T12:01:03+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 12:01PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2007 12:02PM by J_Walton.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the review, Vincent.  It makes me smile and chuckle a bit, which is awesome.  The game is <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/transantiago/" rel="nofollow">posted here</a>, if people are interested.<br/><br/>Your suggestion about how variable time / watches work is dead-on how I would run it.  That stuff just never really made it onto the page.<br/><br/>I was agnostic about whether to make the game GM-agnostic, like TSOY, so I just made it GM-confusing instead.  I get the "making and developing Issues would be harder for some people" thing, which is why I was thinking about having a GM who really wanted to lay down the magical realism.  But I can also imagine some groups playing it with various players being Station Masters of various stations or just taking turns framing or developing Issues for each other.  I think, when it comes to playtesting, I'll try GMing it first.<br/><br/>In my mind, "I preform CPR" is fine, you could "buy a newspaper" as long as you picked up some money somewhere in Transantiago (remember you can't have anything you don't pick up there), but "Your pockets are empty" is only cool if it's actually true, if you haven't picked up any money.  I don't think players (or the GM) can arbitrarily declare things about other characters (that's covered by Suspension of Notice).<br/><br/>I'm pretty cool with characters being gradually defined by the things they accomplish in Transantiago, if people gradually come to know them for what they've done.  Whether this happens or not, I think, would vary depending on how individual players and groups wanted things to happen.  Suspension of Notice is supposed to put a tight cap on character identity initially, to force players to focus externally, on other people's problems instead of their own, but I think having a bit more characterization as the game goes on is not necessarily a bad thing.  Maybe you disagree, though.  What is this "bad thing" you potentially see happening?<br/><br/>I'll definitely check out the games you mentioned.  I know of them but have never read or played them.\n<blockquote>Also, what if each of us had our own deck of cards and a sharpie?</blockquote>\nCan you elaborate on this one?  I cannot see through your beautiful madness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105395/#Comment_105395" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T12:15:13+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 12:15PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2007 12:16PM by lumpley.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So like, I have a deck of cards. I shuffle it and put it nearby. Then I'm in let's say Macul station and I buy a newspaper. I deal myself a card (3 clubs) and I write on it "a newspaper from Macul station." Later on I'm in Rondizzoni station and I see an angel walking in the crowd. I deal myself a card (9 hearts) and I write on it "there's an angel in Rondizzoni station."<br/><br/>Since cards fit with each other in multiple ways, this'd create connections between apparently unconnected things, for possible use in evolving issues. "Hey! The angel in Rondizzoni station and the handmade rock band poster in Belquedano make a pair of nines."<br/><br/>...And that's where my what-if ends. No idea how to implement it or anything. But now having written it out that way I think it'd be better to share a deck than for everyone to have their own.<br/><br/>The "bad thing" is just a feeling. It feels different when I think about playing, like, a guy who learned CPR that one time, instead of an everyperson. Maybe it's not a big deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105398/#Comment_105398" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T12:40:02+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 12:40PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, interesting.  I like the concept.  It's a lot like this thing I do in one version of the Exalted hack, where you staple / tape / glue pieces of paper together (the bits of paper have images and themes written on them) to create a big collage over the course of the game.  You could do the same thing with your playing cards, especially if you're already gonna deface them, attaching them together in various ways as the roads begin to open.  Transcendence would be when everything is connected to everything else.<br/><br/>Ha, well knowing CPR doesn't really make people stand out to me.  In my mind, most people can do basic CPR, but that's probably naive.  So maybe there's a certain suspension of disbelief thing going on here, and we could allow players to call down the Suspension of Notice rule to ixnay stuff that seems too specific for them.  Playing an everyperson is definitely the point, in my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105664/#Comment_105664" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T09:28:12+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  9:28AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just finished reading the game.
