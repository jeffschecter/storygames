Specifically: Player characters are meant to be young -- 10 to 14 years old. Probably street urchins or orphans of some kind, though they could simply be young adventurers. I like the system I've devised to represent this: certain skills are handicapped when you're younger, and you are less able to lend assistance to other characters, though on the flip side you heal more swiftly, enjoy better "luck," and get second chances on more occasions (plus may throw a tantrum from time to time). And if you play a long campaign, this shifts over time as your character ages.<br/><br/>My problem is this: As I back up and look at who the audience might be for a game like this, it occurs to me that there may not be a lot of people who are interested in playing as young / weak characters. While I haven't yet trotted this system out to friends, I'm finding it hard to imagine someone getting excited about taking on the role of an underpowered 11-year-old street urchin (even if it's in an interesting semi-magical, semi-steampunk, semi-Victorian setting, though that might help). I personally think it could be interesting, I'm just not sure how broad a gaming demographic I represent.<br/><br/>I've given just a little thought to alternate frameworks for a similar system (e.g., you're cursed by angry gods and are on a quest to throw off your handicaps while also completing whatever tasks they've set you -- or something), and while I'm seeing some promise in some of those, I still find myself questioning the premise of playing as a weak character.<br/><br/>So I guess I have two questions:<br/>1. Can you point me to any other games in which players take on weak / underpowered characters?<br/>2. Do you think such a game could be at all broadly interesting? (I.e., certainly not as broad as Pathfinder or D&amp;D, and perhaps not even as broad as Fate or Savage Worlds, for example, but maybe approaching something in the junior leagues of the latter.)<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!

(And I find that kind of D&amp;D very enjoyable, personally.)<br/><br/>In any case, when dealing with "weak or incompetent" characters, the real question becomes:<br/><br/>* Are they capable of making meaningful decisions and achieving goals in the context the game presents?<br/><br/>Is the idea, for instance, that these "incompetent" characters manage to accomplish great things, as in a lot of fiction about children or young adults (e.g. fairy tales, Harry Potter, or the hobbits in Lord of the Rings)? Perhaps through luck, courage, insight, moral strength, or by cleverness and collaboration, they manage to achieve meaningful victories.<br/><br/>Here, the appearance of "incompetence" is belied by an actual ability to do great things: the incompetence is entirely a facade created to make the victories all that more amazing. In game turns, I'd expect characters in such a story to be anything but incompetent (although a good game designer could make you feel like you had little chance of winning, if that was desired).<br/><br/>That's entirely different from a game where you fully embrace your character's inability to achieve anything meaningful, like <a href="http://www.halfmeme.com/nicotinegirls.html" rel="nofollow">Nicotine Girls</a>. Here, the entire conceit of the game is to find meaning in your character's struggles and failures.<br/><br/>Which one are you talking about? They're very different, to my eye.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markwallace" title="markwallace"><img alt="markwallace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markwallace">markwallace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449316/#Comment_449316" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-08T08:02:16+00:00" title="November  8, 2015  8:02AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Paul. While I really enjoy the conceit of games like Nicotine Girls, this is definitely meant to be in the other camp. The so-called "incompetent" characters should be able to achieve great things through (to borrow your list) "luck, courage, insight, moral strength, or by cleverness and collaboration."<br/><br/>That list is actually very interesting. I have accounted (mechanically) for a couple of those. Luck and collaboration, certainly. Cleverness, to an extent. But courage, insight, and moral strength would be interesting to incorporate as well.<br/><br/>To explain briefly: In some situations, you have the option to improve a failed or poor roll by using a different skill. You'd have to narrate how you're able to use your Investigate skill to defend against the slingshot stone that's coming your way, of course, but if you can do it, and if you have any more of your (fairly abundant) luck currency (Slugs), you get a chance to improve your result.<br/><br/>Your list makes me think that this mechanic, which at the moment is almost exclusive to combat, could be interesting if it were available throughout. Any time you want to try to supplement a roll you don't like, you can spend a Slug, bring another one of your skills into the narrative, and roll to try to improve your result. In that way, you could let a good storyteller use his or her moral insight, for instance (Empathy skill?), to sneak by the dozing factory boss. A player who likes to fight but has rolled poorly in a negotiation could figure out how to use Strength to add conviction to an argument (short of literally strongarming someone, which would presumably be its own roll).<br/><br/>I don't know if that completely answers my questions, but it helps me think about this in a different way. And hopefully helps focus my request, for anyone who's read this far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449317/#Comment_449317" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-08T08:29:38+00:00" title="November  8, 2015  8:29AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2015 8:35AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's a sizable audience of gamers who don't care about fictional character power level for its own sake.  What really matters is effectiveness in the situations at hand.  If you march a bunch of 11-year-old orphans into a battle designed for Space Marines, now <i>that</i> would suck.  But if your 11-year-olds have to deal with the sorts of things that 11-year-olds can actually deal with, then "underpowered" isn't an issue.  I would love to play an 11-year-old n a game about stealth and lies and courage and teamwork and friendship and imagination.  Maybe I'd even get into some combat -- against rats, dogs, small monsters, asshole 11-year-olds, etc. -- though that wouldn't be my first choice.<br/><br/>If your aim is a <i>broad</i> appeal, then no, I don't think roleplaying kids will get you that.  However, many games that shoot for "broad" wind up achieving "generic" and get <i>no</i> audience.  At least with kids your game is distinctive!  (Not offering any "do"s and "don't"s here, just matters for your consideration.)<br/><br/>Other games where you play kids:<br/>- The Magical Land of Yeld (start as mundane and very young, but can gain very effective powers reasonably quickly)<br/>- Monsters and Other Childish Things (your monster effectively makes you a badass, but, y'know, there'll be times when you're just a kid)<br/><br/>I can also name you games where you play wimpy goblins, second-class citizens, dungeon cannonfodder, slaves, minions, toys, puppets, and many more "underpowered" characters.  Most of these have audience numbers that many sole creators would <i>love</i> to get for their games.  Nowhere <i>near</i> being on the Fate / Savage Worlds map, though.  Few games are!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449319/#Comment_449319" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-08T11:58:44+00:00" title="November  8, 2015 11:58AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so there's <i>Little Fears</i> obviously, about children surviving in a horror fantasy milieu. <i>Princes' Kingdom</i> is about the young princes and princesses of a fantasy kingdom. <i>Dreaming Crucible</i> is about a single pre-teenager getting stuck in the fairy kingdom. <i>Grey Ranks</i> is about teenage boy and girl scouts fighting against Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. <i>Under the Bed</i> is about a child and the toys that help them adapt to the problems in their life. <i>Urchin</i> is about homeless children and adults in horror fantasy New York severs. <i>Ars Magica</i> has a whole supplement dedicated to playing child apprentices of wizards, and it's far from the only game attempting to cash in on the Harry Potter craze.<br/><br/>That's just a quick run-down of what came to mind with two minutes of thinking - there are a lot of games out there that feature children, and even more games that feature characters in positions of weakness. Not everybody likes these games, but those are generally the same people who basically aren't interested in dramatic games anyway, and always and only want to play adventure games in the D&amp;D mold, so I don't know if that demographic is relevant to a designer who isn't making one of those games. "Broad appeal" is a red herring, because being compelling is so much more important that a game designer can rarely afford to sacrifice their originality and vision in exchange for supposed broadness of appeal. As David said, broad appeal is often no appeal at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markwallace" title="markwallace"><img alt="markwallace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markwallace">markwallace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449324/#Comment_449324" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-08T18:31:55+00:00" title="November  8, 2015  6:31PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a><br/>Goblin Quest this is not, though that game looks awesome.

(I'm using it as a metaphor, mind you - actual 11-year-olds fighting in war sounds terribly grim.)<br/><br/>Once again, it's not that different from old-school D&amp;D: a group of underskilled and underprepared bumpkins go to confront enemies much more powerful and dangerous. (Consider that in old-school D&amp;D a typical character has 1d6 hit points, whereas a typical monster has <i>at least</i> 1d8, and better odds of hitting in combat, never mind rules like doors opening automatically for them, but being stuck when the PCs try to open them.)<br/><br/>The key, if you're looking for an adventure genre kind of thing, is to give the "underpowered" characters some way of overcoming that difference. Then they can really feel heroic in action (if that's the design goal here).<br/><br/>Here's another example: in <i>Mouse Guard</i>, you play little mice, who often go up against far more scary opponents, like cats or owls. You have little chance unless you're clever and can use the mechanics to your advantage. In Mouse Guard, that means working together as a team to get bonuses - so you can actually win most of the time, so long as you work as a team. The mechanics support the theme.<br/><br/>Exploiting human cleverness is also a good technique. The opponents may be more "powerful", but they have relatively little smarts. They probably just do the predictable thing - the GM has limited attention and time to devise anything better, after all. The players, however, all put their heads together and come up with the smartest plan they can, and thereby have an advantage. This is how a lot of games (especially old-school D&amp;D) work, and it's quite satisfying when the group is committed to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449329/#Comment_449329" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-08T22:05:42+00:00" title="November  8, 2015 10:05PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was also going to say <i>Little Fears</i>.

You have to poke at the environment a lot, but if you're unlucky in that, you can quickly wind up mutated in a way you might not like.<br/><br/>I actually don't know Goblin Quest!  I was thinking of <a href="https://goblin-uprising.obsidianportal.com/" rel="nofollow">Goblin Uprising</a>!  This is the only one on my list that is not published, but I can certainly talk about it if you want.  It started as a Pathfinder hack and is certainly more traditional than the others I've listed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449338/#Comment_449338" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-09T00:47:53+00:00" title="November  9, 2015 12:47AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2015 12:54AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, having listed so many other people's games already, I might as well list mine.  It's not published, but I can certainly describe it at length.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  In <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/" rel="nofollow">Delve</a>, you start as mundane medieval peasants, armed with only your wits and your willingness to face perils others won't.  By facing such perils and learning from them and acquiring magical stuff along the way, you eventually grow to be anything but mundane.  <br/><br/>Perhaps there's some commonality there, in that you want your 11-year-olds to "achieve great things".  <br/><br/>Some of the other games I mentioned have a similar "start with nothing, work your way up" arc -- Goblin Uprising, Sign in Stranger, and most old-school D&amp;D clones.  Land of Yeld also, sort of; you start as mundane kids, but there's a big jump in power level that presumably happens fairly early on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markwallace" title="markwallace"><img alt="markwallace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markwallace">markwallace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449347/#Comment_449347" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-09T05:23:33+00:00" title="November  9, 2015  5:23AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So much good stuff here, thanks you guys! Thanks <a href="/forums/profile/Chroma">@Chroma</a> for mentioning the The Warren. I actually backed it on Kickstarter <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> but had all but forgotten about it. And <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> thank you for reminding me of Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>Thanks for all those links, <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>. Lots of great material to add to my reading list. (I haven't played <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gshowitt/goblin-quest-a-tabletop-rpg-of-fatal-ineptitude/description" rel="nofollow">Goblin Quest</a> yet, btw, but it looks fun.) Looking forward to checking out Delve.<br/><br/>I'm actually very interested in the more "story" end of the story games spectrum. It's what led me to this forum in the first place, and is a form I've tinkered in just a little bit. I'd considered it for this game at one point, but I think this is a more traditional tabletop RPG -- though hopefully with a few elements that make it interesting in its own way.<br/><br/>I actually think I'll learn the most by just getting it on the table at some point soon. Should be interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449354/#Comment_449354" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-09T10:17:13+00:00" title="November  9, 2015 10:17AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2015 10:19AM by phoenix182.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well first off, this is pretty much the definition of the playstyle of most groups I've been in for 30+ years. Not all, and not always, but most often. In Battletech we always started poor, cobbled together industrial robots or frankenstein mechs. In Shadowrun we cut starting points by 1/3 - 1/2. In D&amp;D we used 0-level rules (frequently playing specifically as children to young teens). In fact, when we customized D&amp;D for our own version the first thing we did was made 1/6 of the game about exactly what you describe...the years that came before making it to '1st level' in a standard game. It's also a big part of the basis for Miserable Goblins in a Hole (another project in the works around here). <br/><br/>I don't know of too many games where this is the total focus, but I've found most can function for it with optional rules or a little hacking. Will be very interested to get this input however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449373/#Comment_449373" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-10T02:34:54+00:00" title="November 10, 2015  2:34AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            World of Darkness: Innocents and Grimm are both worth a look.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
