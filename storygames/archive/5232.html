I get to direct, too <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>We had previously talked about the show, <i>No Man's Land</i>, and what we want out of it.  The main influence is Carnivale: we wanted a gritty early 20th century setting with mystical threads throughout.  We figured out that NML is about an ensemble of American soldiers in the trenches of France, 1917. Added to the horror of trench wars are inexplicable events out in the zone between opposing trenches, where death saturates existence--that zone was historically known as No Man's Land. The timeline is set before the October revolution caused Russia to pull out and thereby allowed Germany to shift troops West and overrun the trenches.<br/><br/>You can find the character stats <a href="http://www.berengad.com/nomansland/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I haven't put up episode guides yet, but some other character pictures are there. The protagonists in short:<br/><br/>David plays The Mick, an Irish staff sergeant with access to supplies, both officially in the supply tent and under the hand. He's also a brawler and all-around tough guy. He's realizing, over the course of the show, that his stealing and dealing is actually costing soldiers' lives, and his issue will be atonement about this. The local Commander, Swanson (Clancy Brown), is on his case and is his nemesis. In the show, The Mick is portrayed by Sean Penn (as seen in Mystic River).<br/><br/>Colin plays George Hale, an upper class doctor now serving as a field surgeon. He was an athlete in med school and is still in good shape. His issue is self-worth, caused by the inability to save so many soldiers who come under his knife. He is portrayed by Jeffrey Combs.<br/><br/>Matt plays Nathan Kaminski, a field sergeant whose issue is grief over the friends and soldiers he's lost. It's triggered a death wish of sorts, making him reckless. He is portrayed by Luke Wilson. His girlfriend, a French girl from the local village they are protecting, is called Elise. She's serving as a nurse under Hale. She is portrayed by Audrey Tautou.<br/><br/>I've suggested Apocalyptica's <i>Cohkka</i> as the theme song, but that hasn't been accepted or rejected yet <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Pilot: "The Exchange".  Orders come in that Nathan is to lead a (somewhat shady) prisoner exchange between the trenches, Hale is to go along to care for the prisoners on the way, and The Mick is to provide them with supplies. At the same time, the hospital is out of morphine--Hale confronts Mick about this in a tense character scene. Mick persuades the others to stage a sneaky raid on the Commander's tent, taking a barrel of Schnaps that Mick can then trade in for morphine. Mick taunts and fights the guards to distract them--cut to the tent inside, a scalpel cutting a line, and Hale's head poking through. They wake up the orderly and have to run. Commander Swanson punishes Mick with a suicide mission across enemy lines, and denies Nathan decent supplies for the exchange run. <br/><br/>Elise pushes to get assigned to the mission to stay close to Nathan. Despite going under the flag, they draw enemy fire out in the field. Nathan charges ahead, risking Private Brewer's (Adrian Brody) life and leaving the others behind. Hale has to calm down a panicking Elise, creating a first bond between them. Nathan takes out the machine gunners, and they move on. In the meantime, Mick and his group are crawling through an ancient tunnel of unknown origin, which leads to one wall of a German supply bunker. They get inside and find that all the German soldiers are dead--in fact, they are frozen solid, without visible wounds. As Mick plants dynamite, an unnatural fog gathers. Mick barely escapes it as it whispers French names behind him, with a bit of frostbite on the back of his neck. The explosion of the supply depot comes just in the middle of the prisoner exchange. The Germans smell a setup and open fire. Nathan and the others manage to save the prisoners and kill the Germans. On their way home, Nathan has a vision of a familiar-seeming female figure in No Man's Land.<br/><br/>Episode 101: Four villagers were brought to the church. They are alive but unresponsive, pale and with wide open eyes. Elise brings Hale to the church because one of them is her aunt, her only living relative. Hale persuades the priest to let him take Aunt Marie to the medical tent where he can examine her more closely. Elise later confronts Nathan about having more feelings for his dead comrades than for her. Mick, using morphine stolen from the German depot as a bribe, persuades Hale to come back there with him. They find the place cleared except for one remaining body bag with a frozen corpse, and after Mick savagely kills two Germans with his trench knife, they make off with the bag.<br/><br/>After their return, Elise joins Hale in the examinations of the corpse and her aunt. While Hale is bent over the microscope and shares his findings with Elise, in the background, we see the body bag sitting up. Outside, Mick and Nathan get into a fistfight over Mick's reckless behavior (including his mission and the return, risking their surgeon). Mick shares his suspicion that Commander Swanson had set them up, and they form a shaky alliance against Swanson. Inside, Hale fights off an attacking frost corpse, creating a fire. He makes it out with Elise, then runs back in to save her aunt. Mick barely escapes the brig for (allegedly) repeated fighting, but gets reamed by Swanson. The episode closes with a shot of the inside of the church, panning underneath the three remaining paralyzed townspeople, who are leaking a heavy, frosty fog.<br/><br/>Next time on <i>No Man's Land</i>: Nathan recklessly storms a bunker, and Private Towns is shot right through the chest as Nathan watches helplessly (this will be his spotlight episode). Mick wines and dines Elise. Hale is in the church, telling everyone that they'll be alright, when a frozen hand reaches through the church doors.<br/><br/>Thoughts and reflections to follow soon, I just wanted to get the fictional part out first while it's still somewhat fresh.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118087/#Comment_118087" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T12:17:35+00:00" title="January  5, 2008 12:17PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sgt.

Green who needs amputation and talks to Elise about the morphine shortage and the pending prisoner exchange mission.  She want to go with them on the exchange to watch over him and to help care for the POWs.  He initially refuses, but later, during the "hook the viewers" sex scene realizes he can't refuse her anything.<br/><br/>Episode 101: Nathan awakes in a sweat from a nightmare in which comrades are dying all around him.  The grief is eating him up.  Elise tries to comfort him but he is cold and distant.  He leaves abruptly saying, "You don't know what it's like out there."  Elise dresses and looks at her expression in the mirror, her face impassive, enigmatic.<br/><br/>The camera follows a bullet from Nathan's Enfield into the eye of a German Maxim gunner during the field mission.<br/><br/>Pvt Brewer's helmet has been hit by bullets innumerable times and Nathan is always having to tell him to keep his head down.<br/><br/>Nathan doesn't notice that Elise is in the med tent and upon hearing from Hale about the frozen corpses, complains that everyone is seeing crazy things lately, that Elise had earlier been "babbling" about some crazy curse her aunt seemed to have fallen under.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the session and have AP thoughts, but am off to run errands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118090/#Comment_118090" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T13:00:36+00:00" title="January  5, 2008  1:00PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds great, guys.

Picking your music, tone, themes, framing your weekly opening sequence, etc. it just feels natural to me to pick the actor that will play your character.  I'd be more likely to choose from less well-known actors next time, TV or smaller movie actors, (as Colin did with Jeffrey Combs), but I don't know many off the top of my head and just wanted to get rolling.  I just thought, "Who has sad eyes and and could play a sympathetic soldier character?" and thought of Luke Wilson from the Royal Tenenbaums for some reason.  I don't personally feel constrained because it's just sort of a mental touchstone and expect the characters will come into their own visually.<br/><br/>I'd probably recommend against actors you feel are frequently playing versions of themselves or have such strong screen presence you have a hard time forgetting it's them, in spite of their craft (Nicholson and DeNiro would be two examples for me).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118106/#Comment_118106" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T15:52:23+00:00" title="January  5, 2008  3:52PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a cool session!

I'm really tired of getting my indie fix entirely through one shots.<br/><br/>Jason asked about choosing actors:<br/><i>Does it kick-start your shared vision of the show? Is it constraining at all?</i><br/><br/>Umm...yes?  I think the constraints in this case are just enough to stimulate creativity.  And I admit that Jeffrey Combs is a bit creepy...I have a penchant for somewhat creepy characters.  I'm trying to play him a bit more like the Jeffrey Combs that Matt posted a picture of, though.  Combs usually gets cast as a) creepy, b) a bastard, c) all of the above, but I'm trying to play against type.  I imagine the producers of the show wanted to give him a break and offered him a slightly more sympathetic role.<br/><br/>AP observations...I've noticed there is this impetus to plot out the whole scene and not do any of the talky roleplay thing unless we <i>really</i> make an effort to stop ourselves and play it out.  It becomes more like plotting out a TV show than roleplay sometimes.  I wonder if other people have this experience too.<br/><br/>Another half-question half-observation...when we set stakes I find that I usually find both options to be palatable.  Maybe this comes from me not minding if awful stuff happens to my character if it makes a good story.  I feel less like one person is challenging another and more like we're just presenting two story options that we're voting on with cards.  It's wierd...you have to totally collaborate at the start of the game to actually *make* the concept for the show, but when playing it out there's supposed to be adversity and opposition.  Or is there?<br/><br/>Regardless, I'm having fun and looking forward to the next game ^_^<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118210/#Comment_118210" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-06T21:24:03+00:00" title="January  6, 2008  9:24PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, when I ran The Professionals at ACNW each character had an actor and a print-out of a photo from the net.

This is easily one of my favorite games ever. I smile and reminisce every time I hear the theme song, as if it was a real show.<br/><br/>It'd be a bit too much to recap everything that happened, but there are two things I'd briefly like to talk about.<br/><br/>First, I tried something different in episode 104. One of the characters, the Mick, had a dream vision. See, he broke into the house of Madame Aurore, whom they think is a witch who is involved in the issue of the catatonic villagers and the frozen German soldiers. He found a tunnel system with an occult room. A human-like creature, like a feral child with horrible teeth and claws, was bound in a magical circle. A list of German names, written in blood, was nearby. The creature broke free, chased down the Mick, and beat him up bad. He was then taken prisoner by Aurore. That was the end of episode 103. Episode 104 begins with Mick in a dark cell, a pale hand touching him and setting off a vision.<br/><br/>I played out the vision by assigning Colin and Matt an NPC role each. I gave Colin a note that said: "Your loyalty to your captain is strong, but so is your conscience." Then I gave Matt a note that said, "You are meeting the General's lover. She thinks it's to take her to him, but your orders are to kill her." Then I played the lover, a young woman, set up the scene, and off we went.<br/><br/>I thought the scene went great. The woman brought the general's bastard baby. The captain asked her to follow him to a foggy river (in the dark of night) and to cross it. The soldier realized what was going on, and while the woman walked ahead, he pleaded with the captain to at least spare the baby. They get to the river and she figures out something's wrong. The soldier tries to take her baby away. The captain swipes with his sword, hitting the soldier and the woman both, and they and the baby fall into the water. The scene cuts to the soldier emerging from the river carrying the baby in his arms; the captain is standing by, pistol drawn. The soldier cries over the dead baby, while the camera shows its one brown and one blue eye just before the soldier closes them.<br/><br/>Cut to the Mick's eyes opening. Suddenly the creature from the magic circle charges at him, but it's chained, and its face stops just inches before his, biting and hissing. Before it withdraws back into the darkness, the Mick looks deep into its brown eye and blue eye.<br/><br/>That was basically the whole scene. I thought letting the other players take the roles of NPCs and giving them "secret" assignments added to the dynamic, but I'd love to hear what Matt, Colin and David thought of it and if it's a technique to be used again in the future.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Second thing: We do kibbitz during each other's narration. At one point, Matt's character was trying to save Colin's from the Germans. Colin was captured by gas-masked special forces and tortured by Erwin, a scrawny middle-aged German fellow. Matt strangled a guard and busted into the place, facing Erwin. Matt wanted to shoot him in the leg (I think), but I suggested he shoot him in the throat just as he was calling for help. Matt did that--but I felt like I might have steamrolled over his playing of his character.  Matt, your thoughts?  Anyone else's thoughts on proposing actions for other people's characters?  We did this a lot in Shock:, too, and there I sometimes felt like it was overwhelming the original player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135405/#Comment_135405" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T12:19:07+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 12:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The dream sequence was very effective in providing a justification for the various story elements that had been collectively cobbled together over the course of play.  I have used dream sequences quite a bit in the past, but in a different context - the characters are drawn into the dream together and react to what happens.  Using a dream sequence as a flashback, as you did, is something I'm not very good at doing (though a bunch of games explicitly include the flashback in the tool box).  I'm only starting to get a grasp of how to create flashbacks that are dynamic (i.e. have meaningful input by the players) as opposed to static narration of a past event.<br/><br/>As for the kibbitzing...it's probably not ideal, but a necessary growing pain when learning how a game works.  As a group, we are collectively better able to understand the focus of the game.  Kibbitzing is a way of sharing viewpoints (maybe a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bad</span> way of sharing, but sharing nonetheless) during play.
