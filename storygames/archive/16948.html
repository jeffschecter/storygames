You've turned a cardboard puzzle into a shared experience, a reason to gather around a table instead of a TV."<br/><br/>What is "fun?" Modern board game designers unpack this mysterious word in new ways, and distill it into playable works of art. Recent shifts in board game design philosophy -- and technology -- are ushering in a boom of innovation that pushes the limits of cardboard chips and wooden bits. Plus: how tension, suspense, immersion, meaningful decisions, and social interaction can be used and combined to meet design goals and boost player experience."<br/></i><br/><br/>We give Story Games a shout out about 4/5 of the way through, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dbrown" title="dbrown"><img alt="dbrown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/133/nMWVBVRKLGUBK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dbrown">dbrown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385857/#Comment_385857" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-26T23:08:43+00:00" title="July 26, 2012 11:08PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice talk.

I think we're seeing a major shift in both aesthetic and technology right now. We discussed this a bit in the talk. The current climate is very conductive to innovation. One designer has a good idea (Like Donald X's Dominion, for example) and other designers take it and run with it, spawning a host of new games that expand upon a mechanic or theme. It's also easier than ever for designers to communicate with one another -- and their audiences. This is extremely beneficial. It's the global city. The Internet puts everyone within reach; it makes it extremely easy to share ideas. So I'd say the future of game design is that it will become more collaborative and inclusive. For examples of this happening now, look at the Tempest project going on at Alderac Entertainment Group, or the D&amp;D Next playtest.<br/><br/>AEG has created a highly thematic game world called Tempest and is using this world as a backdrop not for RPGs or CCGs, but for heady Euro games. They've given a huge toolbox of design resources to designers all over the world to create content (i.e. games) for this game world. This leads to a ton of varied games with different mechanics, couched within a unified thematic set. I really hope it's successful, and that more companies start doing this. It's a good marriage between euro aesthetics and American attitude, but I love it because it's so collaborative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
