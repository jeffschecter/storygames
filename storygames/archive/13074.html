The example you give in the show of a character using an "I Know a Guy" aspect to find an NPC to help with something seems to me to step on a big chunk of the Contacts skill. I think I'm more interested in mechanical elegance than the Evil Hat guys, but I sometimes wonder if this muddiness makes the overall system harder to understand and/or explain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294658/#Comment_294658" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T12:03:06+00:00" title="September 26, 2010 12:03PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always took that to mean that you were rolling your Contacts skill and then invoking the aspect on top of it.

When aspects also sometimes act like skills it makes the game more confusing to engage with. Since you can already "make things true" via declaration skill rolls, and you can already make yourself score well on a skill roll via standard invocation of aspects as Jason described, I don't think there's a need for this mechanic, and I think the existence of this option can confuse and distract people learning the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294666/#Comment_294666" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T13:45:24+00:00" title="September 26, 2010  1:45PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...

The "Invoking for Effect" section in SOTC is pretty clear that this is essentially a minor Declaration, with the invocation allowing it to be less minor. It is there to give the players a bit of narrative input, rather than to make skills meaningless. It's not about "bypassing" rolls.<br><br>Contacts is about getting information from knowing people. In the case of "I know a guy," invoking for effect could very well mean that you know the guy and he's around. That doesn't necessarily mean you find him. And it doesn't necessarily mean you get the info from him.
