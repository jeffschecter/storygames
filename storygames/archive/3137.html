The last days of the Devil Dogs (or whatever gang) is captured in this fast and deadly game of gang members alpha dogging one another across the scandinavian landscape. Steadily, the law gains on the gang members as they draw closer and closer to their end. Run without a GM, the game is almost an antithesis of George's Children, telling instead the story of youth gone wild.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight was my third attempt at playtesting this. This is my first post about the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaytesters: Aaron, Colin, Josh, Mark, me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game opened tonight with the death of the previous gang leader (as is normally the case; the players fight for "dominance" in the leaderless gang). During a turn, the active player sets up a challenge for the entire gang. The player who rolls the best for the challenge describes the failure of the person who rolled worst. And the person who rolled worst suffers "damage" getting them closer to being caught by the law.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis person then becomes the active player and sets up a new challenge. This continues again and again, as the story escalates.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we had an "okay" time, there were a number of flaws with this design... which I am ironing out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you continue to fail, you'll never really be involved in the story and while I wanted an alpha dog-like design reflected in the game, this was too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo. I'm going to be fixing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game needs a reward system, even if everyone dies at the end. Which presently, it does not have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there needs to be opportunities to affect the story, even if you're not "involved." Which I'll also be adding.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, I can get more feedback on Saturday at Kubla Con and then have a better read on the mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone who participated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71581/#Comment_71581" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T03:15:31+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  3:15AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Why Sweden?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Olle%20Jonsson" title="Olle Jonsson"><img alt="Olle Jonsson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://olle.1av10.nu/pics/site/face.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Olle%20Jonsson">Olle Jonsson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71587/#Comment_71587" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T04:31:00+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  4:31AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>+1, why Sweden?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71624/#Comment_71624" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T08:04:52+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  8:04AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2007 8:09AM by markv.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From what Jim told us, he was inspired by the cycle scenes in Luigi Scattini's 1968 film \xe2\u20ac\u02dcSweden: Heaven and Hell\xe2\u20ac\u2122 (which used to be all over youtube but has been mainly removed)<br/><br/>I loved the premise and color and setting of this game and how players dropped like flies. Colin's cycle rammed an RV, then he jumped inside to brawl with the driver, then the RV was hit by a truck. Later we fought with some brawny gay finnish sailors, who returned later to firebomb our hideout shack and Jim's biker was set ablaze, and, still wreathed in fire, ran to his cycle and revved off to explode. Aaron and my characters lasted longest. In an intentional bergmanesque counterpoint to the rest of the game, we bled to death in a hospital waiting room.<br/><br/>I do agree that players need to be able to narrate more equitably for this game to work consistently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71660/#Comment_71660" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T10:11:00+00:00" title="May 24, 2007 10:11AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really good sumation of the game session.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah. I need to get the "voice" into everyone's hands. Even if it's an alpha dog game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Sweden... yeah. Jon Hodgson and I were floored by how "bad" that film promo on You Tube was. And we were excited to do a game that was the opposite of George's Children... youth with everything lost vs. youth gone wild. I may have to steal some toys from GC in order to make Murdercycles play a little smarter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
