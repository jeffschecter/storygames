                    As a GM in most games you have (roughly speaking) three types of authority:<br/><br/>Propaganda - the social expectations of your role, including the "GM is God" rhetoric, but also includes more benign aspects, such as coordinating or hosting the game.<br/><br/>Ownership - the ownership of aspects of the fiction, in many ways this is analogous to the player's main source of authority, as well.<br/><br/>Ubiquity - the facilitation role of the GM in the system, this includes both arbitration and instigation. <br/><br/>It's clear that keeping all three of these forms of authority poses a significant risk of abuse. <br/><br/>Propaganda is the most obvious form, hinting of unmitigated exercises of power. Ownership tends to be a common source of problems, as it leads to possessiveness - GM's character, GM's setting, GM's story, or even just GM's theme. Ubiquity seems to be something that gets clouded over by the ownership and propaganda, but ultimately it is the the thing the GM does that is unique to the role.<br/><br/>A Vow of Poverty is to try to give up the first two forms of authority: propaganda and ownership. Focus on your role as arbitrator and instigator. Let the rhetoric of power lie, and treat your possessions (characters, settings, and stories) as communal property - at most given over to your safe-keeping. <br/><br/>As GMs, its easy to ignore the importance of our facilitating role, to focus on what we have or what is said about us. But ubiquity is an authority that is qualitatively different, one of synergy and buy-in. If you give up everything else, you might just find something you never knew was there.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                </div>

                            The problem is that someone has to have that authority and if others don't want it, your giving it up will kill the game (and, given the social aspects of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, possibly friendships). <br/><br/>But if they do want it, that's another story.                        </div>

                            I have to agree, at some point <i>someone</i> has to be willing to step up and accept the authority, and the odds that you're going to get five or six people who can agree to share it equally and smoothly (let alone five or six people who actually <i>want</i> it in the first place) is...well, I think you're more likely to win the lottery.  If you've got players who want it, awesome: share away.  If you don't, your experiments in leaving it up to everyone else are doomed.<br/><br/>What might be better advice for GMs is this:<br/><br/><i>DON'T BE A JERK.</i><br/><br/>It's succinct, and probably more useful in the long run than coming up with a bizarre propaganda/ownership/ubiquity triad.  If you're not a jerk, then you don't make insane comments about wearing the viking hat and how rocks fall and everyone dies.  If you're not a jerk, you know that you can be possessive about things in the game without being completely inflexible and/or unwilling to accept letting the players mess around with 'em.  If you're not a jerk, people will be willing to accept you as an arbitrator and instigator without a lot of fuss.  If you're not a jerk, then when you've got a gaming group that's itchin' to take on some of the GM's role, you let 'em.  It's great when the GM isn't a jerk.<br/><br/><br/>Mind you, I might have missed the point here.  I've re-read Mendel's post a few times now and I'm still not sure what he's trying to get at, unless it's just a more complicated way of saying "Don't be a megalomaniacal GM who refuses to let the players participate as anything other than observers in your precious game," i.e., "Don't be a jerk."  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            Buh?  That's pretty strange names for the GM's roles, and it also groups those roles differently from what comes readily to my mind.  Besides, when I'm a player I don't always want the GM to pass the roles you group under propaganda and ownership.  It varies with the game and the group.  I definitely prefer the "Don't be a jerk" rule of thumb.                        </div>

Oh, absolutely; there's probably at least one definition for every gaming group, since every group's going to eventually have to figure out what behavior they find acceptable, unacceptable, or just plain annoying.  No doubt that's why it's one of those topics that is constantly being discussed in one form or another on just about every RPG forum and mailing list out there.  I suppose it's due to be taken out of the barn and trotted around the pasture once more, so feel free, good sir.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            JD, two things. First, what you're talking about can probably be covered entirely in the one area that Mendel is talking about the GM neccessarily keeping - ubiquity. So he's not saying to give that up.<br/>
<br/>
Second, to the extent that it's not covered by Ubiquity, and the GM is required to delve into the other areas, he's not saying it's not the GM's responsibility. It is. He's saying that it should be treated like you're a priest collecting money at church. It's being given to you not to exploit, but to use for the good of the group. A power to be given back immediately when it's not neccessary to be using it.<br/>
<br/>
Do I have that right, Mendel?<br/>
<br/>
You're absolutely right that you need to have leaders in games, JD. But the point is to be a reluctant, though enthusiastic leader. So that you don't fall into some bad pattern.<br/>

Hell, I've had that happen when I asked for a little bit more pro-active play from character players, much less more GM-type responsibility.<br><br>Out of curiosity, have you seen it more in those familiar with gaming or noobies? In general, I've gotten much more hassle from experienced gamers in this regard, but that's strictly my experience.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hi!<br>
  I like the analysis, BUT, I think your terminology is stilted. By giving the hosting duties of the GM job a name with a negative connotation like "propaganda" is maybe starting off on the wrong foot...<br>
  Seems like you should aim for a neutral or even positive connotation:<br>
Propaganda - Try moderating or coaching?<br>
Ownership - Might want to pick something more intuitive like authorship or control<br>
Ubiquity - Try Referee, arbitration.<br>
  I don't think you can really divvy them up so easily. I mean, in the purest role of just interpreting the rules and possibly initiating some scenes, you exert the other two kinds of powers automatically. I think the best anyone can do in a game with a GM is dial the three around. I don't think you can turn it off or on like a light, you know?<br/>

                            I dunno that our current game group has any of the two authorities (and possibly even not the third) distributed specifically to the GM. The person running a particular week's session is rarely the person to initiate organization, and is the host only randomly (we have two places we play and generally rotate back and forth.) Ownership of the fiction seems to distribute itself according to whoever happens to care more about that part of the fiction, independent of who happens to be GMing (though I can think of exceptions.) <br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is, this side-discussion sounds like anarchism vs. authoritarianism to me, and I'm willing to say that anarchy is easily achieved by a small group of people.                        </div>

Fair enough. It's something I'm curious about, but I can't foresee any practical way to test the idea and get good info either way.                        </div>

                            One of the terms I like for GM is <i>Facilitator</i>--the GM is there to <i>facilitate</i> play. That means taking the steps necessary to husband it and enhance it while not being the dictator or (certainly) tyrant of the game. We've had some questions about how to handle ownership-of-fiction come up recently in games (situations where a very knowledgeable <i>character</i> is reliant on the GM for insight into the situation--something that is less than optimal).<br/><br/>My conclusion (as the Player with the character) was that I was still interested in the GM's "ownership" of some of the elements of the fiction since he had a freakin' stunning situation dealing with a take on eastern religions I found educational, fascinating, and, well awesome. I was interested in seeing what he did with <i>that piece of it</i> which made it less optimal to just make up my own stuff and try to fit it together (note: although certainly a socket for the game, the exploration of this concept is not my primary purpose for playing or the central part of my enjoyment of the game--but having to use the GM as the source of authority means my philosopher-character has some difficulties in playing as an expert without referencing the GM).<br/><br/>So I think there may be some work to be done there--but I conclude that even in a situation where there <i>is</i> an issue--and where things are not optimal--the presence of good will on the part of the GM is a <i>more preferable solution</i> (to me) than a vow of poverty (if I understand that right) would be.<br/><br/>(which is not to say I strongly disagree with the post, just that it's not the end of the story).<br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            Mike is pretty much right. <br/><br/>I think the main disconnect here is that authority and responsibility are not the same thing. While responsibilities need to be met, the authority under which they are met is not as inflexible. This also makes the naming for Propoganda clearer - translating "I'm the GM" or "This is my house" or "I bought the pizza" into game authority borrows from the social awareness of the roles. <br/><br/>The key thing is that most authority is unnecessary, and in my personal experience, ubiquity is largely enough to meet your responsibilities. The problem is that the GM role is rich with authority, making it easy to be heavy handed or rely on one approach to excess. Ubiquity is underutilized precisely because it is more subtle and often requires more care in its use. <br/><br/>The purpose of a Vow of Poverty is to learn how to be a GM differently, to expand your set of tools and skills. It's not saying that propoganda and ownership are irrelevant or abusive by nature, but to reveal that other means exist, and to explore their use. <br/><br/>The more options you have the easier it is not to "be a jerk". If you wanted to be a jerk, then not much prevents that. If you didn't you likely do not have the tools to know what you were doing or know another way to do it. The purpose of a vow of poverty is to ease that problem, among others.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>
