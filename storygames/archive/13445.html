The themes of the game, young making life alter choices and sacrifices, appeal to me greatly. I have yet to play a multi-generation campaign, but I am certain I would enjoy it greatly. I love multi-generational sagas.<br/><br/>I wish, however, to set it in real-world Qu\xe9bec history. Starting with New France, a little after the foundation of Qu\xe9bec City, and onwards from there.<br/><br/>(I am Qu\xe9becois and interested in my culture and my roots).<br/><br/>I've been reading up about the history and life in New France. I find it very interesting and inspiring, if a little (or alot) depressing. Depressing, because it seems most leaders we had in this period until the Brittish conquest (and possibly/probably later, too, I'm just focused on times prior for now) most leaders were incompetent and corrupt and got away with it because no one in France <i>cared</i>! The few genuinely good people tended to have downer endings. But that all fits with the overall mood of the game : you can't have it all, you've got to choose what matters most to you, and never look back.<br/><br/>So, overall, I think it would work very well. Of course, it adds some limits in narration. Historical facts cannot be altered. Which adds to the tragedy of it all, or makes you focus on personal matters. All cool stuff.<br/><br/>Any thoughts? Anyone tried something like that before? What system do you use for historical games?<br/><br/>For experienced Hero's Banner players, how long have you been able to sustain a campaign before it grew stale? Quebec's history spans 400 years since colonisation started, even further back if you start counting with the "discovery" of Canada by Jacques Cartier. That's 20 generations, a potential 20-sessions campaign... A bit much, perhaps?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303251/#Comment_303251" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T17:20:44+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  5:20PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played more than two generations of Hero's Banner, so I have no idea what covering 400 years of history in an unbroken chain would look like. I think for such a grand project the weight of sacrosanct history would become a burden. <br/><br/>For a shorter run, though, absolutely, I would personally love it. I think Hero's Banner would handle history very well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303258/#Comment_303258" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T18:04:01+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  6:04PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find playing within "real" history to be really intimidating.

So you can start with historical knowledge and the starting situation, but I think you'll have a better experience knowing who the personages are and what they want, rather than replicating events. You can use the historical information with the other players to inform events, but you'll have to interpret them increasingly abstractly as the events you cause take place.</p>\n<p>Also, 20 sessions feels like a lot to load upfront. I suggest you enjoy every session on its own merits, not as a delayed gratification thing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calithena" title="Calithena"><img alt="Calithena" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calithena">Calithena</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303338/#Comment_303338" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T17:22:46+00:00" title="December  5, 2010  5:22PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you probably should plan the number of Hero's Banner character group-arcs (are they called 'sessions'?) you play precisely, any more than you can plan the exact number of towns your Dogs will go to over a narrative arc. At least if you're going for thematic pressure. But I mention the two games in connection here because for me what you do from town to town in Dogs and what you do from character group to character group in Hero's Banner are similar - at least they would be similar to me - the point of connecting the stories rather than just playing a new set of Dogs towns or HB characters would be to press harder on the moral issues you had confronted in the previous cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, with the new Hero influence being your old character, it seems that the point of the series of connected cycles would be to figure out what issues you were trying to express/explore with the original character and go after them in new ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nTanith Lee's <i>Storm Lord</i> trilogy is an imperfect example of the sort of thing you might try to do with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to blow my old school cred if I say any more so I'm out. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303343/#Comment_303343" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T18:39:59+00:00" title="December  5, 2010  6:39PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2010 6:43PM by Cedric P.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it will be wiser to keep the 3 generations arc and not try to cover everything.<br>You could maybe aim for 5 generation if you want a big campaign.  <br><i>De Remarquables Oubli\xe9s</i> is a great radio emission for inspiration: <a href="http://www.radio-canada.ca/radio/profondeur/remarquablesoublies/accueil.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.radio-canada.ca/radio/profondeur/remarquablesoublies/accueil.html</a>.

Completely fictitious. They would however be contemporaries of historical figures, and the will be a part of actual events.<br><br>Like, if you lived in the colony anytime between 1608 and 1635, they would have met the fouder and commander, Samuel de Champlain. Because the colonists were few and numbers and it is likely that everybody knew everybody back then.<br/><br/>Now, few people know what Champlain was like. Historians don't agree on his looks, early history, or personality. This allows me some creative freedsom as GM.<br/><br/>Some things are set in stone though. Like, Champlain caputilating to the Kirke brothers in 1629. (The territories would return in French hands a few years later).<br/><br/>Now, I could tell players to create characters, tell them this session will start in 1624 and will climax with the capitulation in 1629. But the game is not about the capitulation. The players mark down story goals that have little or nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>It's like the movie Titanic. You know, going in, that the ship will hit an iceberg and sink. If you are well-versed in the history of the event, you might even know wich historical characters will perish and who will escape. But it doesn't matter, the story is about Rose and Jack's forbidden romance.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
