I did some quick internet research and thought, "Hey, <i>The Mountain Witch</i> is already set up like that... more or less."<br/><br/>1. Introduction<br/>2. Building Tension (Development)<br/>3. Fates Revealed (Twist)<br/>4. Conclusion (Reconciliation)<br/><br/>Granted, by default fates in tMW are set up as a tension that must be resolved, but with some mindfulness on the part of the players, fates could easily be brought up in a more twist-y and less conflict-ly way. The GM could also emphasize the twist by having the first two acts revolve around the journey up the mountain and fighting monsters/bandits/etc, and then introducing the Witch and his personal servants (Yuki-Onna, etc) in the third act, who are nothing like the players/characters imagined (that's something I actually do quite often).<br/><br/>Setting up the game like this was definitely something I did intuitively when I wrote it, and now I'm wondering if this is something I should emphasize in the future, and if so, how do I do that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384615/#Comment_384615" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-09T13:26:17+00:00" title="July  9, 2012  1:26PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tie it in to the reference material?<br/>You already mentioned certain movies or stories that would be inspirational to tMW.  Maybe you can sidebar some information on how they fit the kishotenketsu structure.<br/><br/>Rashomon, for instance, doesn't have any present conflict, per se.  It revolves around developing a truth from previous testimony, then we twist that testimony with the final testimony of the woodcutter.  We see all of this has upset the traveler, the woodcutter, and the priest.  Reconciliation comes when the woodcutter comes to face his guilt over the theft, and the priest decides to trust the woodcutter with the child.<br/><br/>My example is poor, but perhaps others can help with their own?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
