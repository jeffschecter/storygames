This would be like a guestbook in a bed and breakfast or something, usually they just have lines in them.<br/><br/>But <a href="http://knockknockstuff.com/product/car-guest-book/" rel="nofollow">this had choices</a>, pick the type of music that was listened to, what did the driver do wrong. It was mildly clever, but it reminded me of the game Space Alert New Frontiers which included achievements you could earn when playing the boardagame, and each achievement gave you points to leveling up a character.<br/><br/>It was stuff like "Everyone agrees your leadership was great," or more specific stuff like "Make it to each room in the ship during one game." If you haven't <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/61492/space-alert-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">played this boardgame</a> you should its a ton of fun.<br/><br/>But yeah It made me think that you could make a cool set of achievements for a roadtrip and maybe even leverage that into a sort of passive roadtrip or car RPG.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455310/#Comment_455310" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T22:12:38+00:00" title="July 26, 2016 10:12PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like an excellent idea, but I'm not entirely sure where this kind of thing becomes an "RPG". <br/><br/>That would be the really interesting part of it, for me. Anyone can create a game with a list of achievements to be played on a road trip (which could be fun!), but how do you turn that into something which creates roleplaying, stories, narratives? Definitely an interesting space to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455318/#Comment_455318" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T23:38:05+00:00" title="July 26, 2016 11:38PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its possible you could use various different aspects of of the road trip, millage, make model and color of car, to generate prompts for stories.<br/><br/>Other than that Im not 100% I guess that's why im throwing it out there to see anyone else has any cool ideas.<br/><br/>I would also be cool with just achievements....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
