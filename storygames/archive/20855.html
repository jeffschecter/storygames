It's meant to emulate and parody James Bond films while being approachable and intentionally diverse. I'm interested in any feedback anyone has. I'm still in the design phase so I'll be editing phrasing and names later.<br/><br/>------------\n<h1>Main Rules</h1>\nI Have Just the Thing is a storytelling game about a superspy which is meant to emulate spy movies like James Bond. The game is intended for 2 to 8 players.\n<h3>Setup</h3>\n\tFirst pick a starting location which is where the superspy is from. The starting location must be outside the United States and the United Kingdom, and the superspy cannot be a white man.<br/><br/>\tPick a codename. If you can't think of one, choose a color and an animal:<br/><br/>Black\t\tTiger<br/>White\t\tFox<br/>Green\t\tSnake<br/>Red\t\tEagle<br/>Blue\t\tElephant<br/><br/>\tThen pick one mental descriptor from the following list:<br/><br/>Clumsy, Sauve, Smart, Comedic, Impulsive, Doubtful, Romantic, Silent, Violent, Pristine, Refined, Skittish<br/><br/>\tAnd pick one physical descriptor from the following list:<br/><br/>Old, Young, Saggy, Greasy, Attractive, Jovial, Stone-faced, Buff, Quick, Unattractive, Lanky, Plump<br/><br/>\tNext, come up with a supervillain name, such as Dr. Villanous, Colonel Pain or Lady Moneybags.<br/><br/>\tNext, create the plot deck. Without looking at the text of the cards, draw the number of scene cards for the number of players you have:<br/><br/># players\t# scene cards<br/>2\t\t3<br/>3\t\t3<br/>4\t\t5<br/>5\t\t7<br/>6\t\t9<br/>7\t\t4<br/>8\t\t5<br/><br/>\tCreate the plot deck by placing the Final Conflict card face down to make the bottom. Then place a scene card. Then place the Plot Reveal card. Then place the rest of the scene cards. Top it off with the Briefing Card and finally the Last Mission Card.\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n\tThe game is played in turns. The player who most recently saw a superspy movie goes first. Each player will take a turn narrating a scene and then control will pass to the player on their left. <br/><br/><b>Turns</b><br/>\tOn a turn, the controlling player draws an Item Card and a Function Card. This defines a cool gadget in the form of: \u201cIt\u2019s a [Item Card] that [Function Card]\u201d such as \u201cIt\u2019s a form fitting tuxedo that poisons sharks.\u201d The player does not reveal the cards to the other players. The player narrates a scene with the superspy in it continuing the story. The scene must involve the superspy getting into a type of trouble or conflict where their gadget (the cards they drew) is the perfect thing to get them out of trouble. A scene should take about 1-2 minutes.<br/>\tFor example, with the form fitting tuxedo that poisons sharks, the player would narrate a scene where the superspy goes to a fancy party to gather information. Then the villain floods the room and releases sharks. The superspy saves the partiers by jumping into the mouths of sharks and poisoning them. <br/><br/><b>Tokens</b><br/><br/>\tEach player starts with one token. Tokens can be spent for the following effects:<br/>* Redraw a card<br/>* Change a detail in a your scene or someone else's scene<br/><br/>----------------------\n<h1>Item Cards</h1>\nBaseball Cap<br/>Belt<br/>Boombox<br/>Briefcase<br/>Camera<br/>Car<br/>Cellphone<br/>Clear Liquid<br/>Condom<br/>Diamond Necklace<br/>Form Fitting Tuxedo<br/>Full Martini Glass<br/>Glasses<br/>Golf Club<br/>Gum<br/>Handbag<br/>High Heels<br/>Makeup<br/>Motorcycle<br/>Pen<br/>Rubber Duck<br/>Silk Bed Sheet<br/>Skin Colored Cream<br/>Skis<br/>Straw Hat<br/>Surfboard<br/>Tampon<br/>Umbrella<br/>Underwear<br/>Watch<br/><br/>----------------------\n<h1>Function Cards</h1>\nCauses Blindness<br/>Conceals 50 gold coins<br/>Conceals a Blade<br/>Conceals a Parachute<br/>Creates a Mask to Impersonate Someone<br/>Creates an Exact Replica of an Object or Image<br/>Creates a Smokescreen<br/>Deciphers Codes<br/>Detects Radiation<br/>Electrocutes Everyone Touching It<br/>Explodes Violently<br/>Fires a Flare<br/>Fires a grappling hook<br/>Hacks into Traffic Cameras and Lights<br/>Is a Gun<br/>Is a Jetpack<br/>Is a Rebreather<br/>Poisons Sharks<br/>Reflects lasers<br/>Repels Alligators<br/>Shoots a Knockout Dart<br/>Shoots a Laser<br/>Shoots Flames<br/>Summons a Boat<br/>Transforms into a Plane<br/>Transmits its Location<br/>Turns You Invisible<br/><br/>--------------------------\n<h1>Plot Cards</h1>\nLast Mission - The superspy finishes their mission.

It works well in practice. I always have fun and the other players usually have fun. There are still spots that I want to improve though such as character creation, organization of the text, and the structure of how cards are handed out and when.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
