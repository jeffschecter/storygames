However, I was amazed to find a treasure chest of great random tables in <b><a href="http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/BasicRules_Playerv3.4.pdf" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D 5 Basic Rules (free)</a></b> (Character Backgrounds, p.37-42).<br/><br/>It provides very useful random tables such as Personality Trait, Ideal, Bonds, Flaws.<br/>You could quickly set up interesting character backgrounds and play a story-oriented game, without caring much about the hack &amp; slash mechanics or even ignoring the setting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts" title="Hybridartifacts"><img alt="Hybridartifacts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts">Hybridartifacts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449281/#Comment_449281" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-05T16:47:01+00:00" title="November  5, 2015  4:47PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that got me looking at 5e because I love random tables. I still prefer more open ended/interpretative approaches like the one I have been using with tarot... but overall these are not bad...I like the way they link in to a theme like acolyte and criminal (with a suggestion one might be able to mix those up a bit with class perhaps - like an acolyte thief or a a criminal priest). Its vaguely reminiscent of some of the Pendragon games background generation (and of course the two could probably be used together if you wanted to create a small fiefdom for a fighter for instance).<br/><br/>My main response is that 5e doesn't look too bad at first sight (I got a bit fed up with 3e options and 4e just seemed a big no). I shall take a deeper look, and thanks for the post!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449362/#Comment_449362" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-09T16:56:28+00:00" title="November  9, 2015  4:56PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5E is great... *if* you actually play with the story stuff mattering. You have to have the players write their Bonds, Ideals, Flaws, and Traits (BIFTs), you have to have them visually apparent at all times, say on character placards, and you have to award Inspiration for players making tough / interesting decisions based on them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
