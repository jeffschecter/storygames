So forgive me for being brief.<br/><br/>The apocalypse isn't a natural or political breakdown, but a technological one. Civilization has reached a post-scarcity state, very similar to Freemarket, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, etc. The Aggregate goes crazy, creating the Psychic Maelstrom. Play takes place on one of the few remaining hotspots, a city that still projects the Aggregate's signal. The city works like a broken version of the Donut- people collect and spend flow, interface wireless, replicate things, but all through interacting with the psychic maelstrom. The farther from the city you go, the weaker the signal, until you can just barley hear screams through the loose static.<br/><br/>Don't know if that makes sense to anybody else. Good night.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
