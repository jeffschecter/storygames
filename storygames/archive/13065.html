It struck a chord with me.  Action Points have always bothered me.  They are cool in principle but something always seemed a little off about them.  They are pretty limited as written in the rules and keeping track of them is kind of a pain.  So I took some of Ralph's ideas and have decided to incorporate them into my 4e game.  Here's the rules I've instituted.<br/>------------------------------<br/><b>Action Points Uses:</b><br/><br/>   1. A free Standard Action.<br/>   2. Take a Second Wind.<br/>   3. An additional 1d8 of damage.<br/>   4. A +2 to your defenses until the end of your next turn.<br/>   5. Refresh a Daily Power or Encounter Power.<br/><br/>A player can spend 1 AP per turn at Heroic levels, 2 per turn at Paragon levels and 3 per turn at Epic levels.<br/><br/>A character no longer gets 1 Second Wind per encounter.  He simply spends an AP to get the Second Wind.<br/><br/><b>Getting Action Points:</b><br/><br/>   1. You get an Action Point every time you fail a roll during an encounter.<br/>   2. Action Points reset to 1 at the end of each encounter.<br/>   3. You may carry over AP\u2019s equal to the number of Healing Surges you have used.<br/><br/><b>Example:</b><br/><br/>Grog, the Halfling Barbarian, has 8 healing surges.  At the beginning of Encounter <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> he has 1 AP.  He fails 2 rolls for +2 AP during the encounter, uses no healing surges and leaves the encounter without using any AP\u2019s.  His AP total resets to 1 so he enters Encounter <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> with 1 AP.  In Encounter <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> he whiffs 3 rolls for +3 AP, spends 2 healing surges and spends 1 AP.  At the end of Encounter <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> he loses 1 AP because he can only carry over 2 AP since he has used 2 healing surges.  In Encounter <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> Grog fails 7 rolls for +7 AP, uses 2 AP and uses 6 healing surges.  At the end of Encounter <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> Grog can carry over 6 AP to the next Encounter.  However, after Encounter <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> the party decided to take an extended rest.  Everyone\u2019s healing surges are refreshed so Grog loses all but 1 of his Action Points.  Yay for Grog!<br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Has anyone else tried anything like this?  How did it turn out?  Anyone see any glaring holes in these rules?  Any way to tweek them that would make them cooler?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294501/#Comment_294501" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T06:51:42+00:00" title="September 24, 2010  6:51AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you get all of those effects when you spend an AP?  Or just pick one from the list?  Because "Take a standard action" already covers the second wind option.  And the second wind option is way better than +2 to defenses, because second wind already gives you +2 to defenses.  (It's also redundant, as the standard action option already covers this, in that Total Defense exists as a standard action that you can take.)<br/><br/>The 1d8 damage doesn't scale well as you go up in level.  Of course, the complaints that you describe only really apply in Heroic tier anyway: by Paragon you'll have interesting stuff to do with APs.<br/><br/>Do you need to spend the AP for extra damage before you roll?  Or is it "add damage to an attack that already hit"? If you spend before the roll, it sucks as an option (better to get another standard action).  If it is afterward, can I spend more than one?  Can I blow all my APs to gain +10d8?<br/><br/>Refreshing encounter powers is a superstrong ability.  4e avoids ever refreshing daily powers, and only has Daily options for refreshing encounter powers.  If you combine "refresh a daily" with "gain an AP on a miss" you basically have made all powers Reliable, and will have PCs doing 2-3x as much damage as they are supposed to do. There's no way you could rely on existing monsters to challenge a party using these rules.<br/><br/>Giving away APs every other turn seems ludicrous.  It means that people will accrue APs and spend them like water.  This plus infinite second winds means that Leaders are obsolete (at-wills are also obsolete).<br/><br/>Characters who make more attack rolls (wizards and rangers and the like) will be getting more APs than other classes under this system.  I don't think that that is intentional.<br/><br/>You will tend to get fights that are blockier: since I'll have more APs, I'll spend them in chunks. So instead of it being me, you, me you, it's me you me me me me you.<br/><br/>If you're annoyed at the amount of bookkeeping required now, I don't know why you'd want a system that requires more bookkeeping and more frequent bookkeeping.<br/><br/>Those are the issues that I see off the top of my head.  With as radical a change as this would be, you probably also mess up other stuff I'm not seeing right now.<br/><br/>Oh one more: humans become really nice for all their AP feats and Action Surge totally incredible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294504/#Comment_294504" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T07:11:08+00:00" title="September 24, 2010  7:11AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that seems pretty unbalanced, Nick has a good run-down of the basic issues. I like the notion that you'd get some sort of currency out of failed rolls, and the idea of tying it to spent healing surges is interesting as well in how it compensates for resource drain, but those effects are much too strong for something like that. In fact, I'm a bit dubious about whether this sort of thing is salvageable at all - the standard action points are already such a quirky thing that expanding on the mechanic seems unlikely to improve matters in a game this complex and fragile. Were it some other game I'd be all for a more dynamic action point mechanism, but here it seems that everything you do has direct impact on the tactical virtues of the game.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be entirely defeatist, though, as I really do think that the default action point system is pretty lame - were I playing 4th edition routinely, I'd most likely mess about with fixing that part of the system as well (unless I just decided to drop it entirely, that is). I fear that the game is too complex for me to even speculate about the proper way of going about it without thoroughly refreshing myself on it, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294507/#Comment_294507" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T07:47:28+00:00" title="September 24, 2010  7:47AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did work out an alternate action point mechanic for my Maho Shoujo 4E variant, but enough other elements changed as to make it difficult at best to relate it to D&amp;D 4E. Some simple ideas were to split Action points in half, into Reserve points - which let you spent variable numbers for different results: 1 reserve point gives you advantage or lets you stunt to use a power you have in a situation which it would not normally apply, 2 gives you an extra action. Even larger expenditures let you freeform a new power right there - although I'm back to the drawing board on the exact mechanisms for this.<br/><br/>I'd have to go back to my notes to remember if there was a refresh rate, but the default story (similar to daily for D&amp;D folks - except the story ends when it ends, not at some arbitrary time interval) quantity was based on a wisdom like ability score and your class (in a similar way to how constitution affects your number of surges). <br/><br/>I was aiming for making a default 3 person Maho Shoujo group equivalent to a 5 person D&amp;D group, so increasing the availability of extra actions was very consciously a power boost. But my primary goal was to give players a direct way to take control of page 42 style stunting so that it was less of an add on. Which is something I'm still working on.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294520/#Comment_294520" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T09:25:09+00:00" title="September 24, 2010  9:25AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2010 9:26AM by Michael Pfaff.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As mentioned above, APs are so ingrained into other mechanics in the game (especially at Paragon+ levels) that adding this kind of mechanic would add serious complications to the game.

It'll hopefully speed up combat cause those missed encounters can be used again. I wouldn't go with recharging Dailies in my game (mostly because I think dailies are too good, and people would spam dailies in the beginning and expect recharges and because some classes have better dailies and others no dailies [new essentials classes]) but it might work in your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294521/#Comment_294521" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T09:34:46+00:00" title="September 24, 2010  9:34AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2010 12:18PM by cy.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are some pretty far reaching changes that would basically change the whole face of the game.  <br><br>The one change I would suggest is giving everyone the ability to re-roll a d20 with an action point (ala Elven Accuracy.)  That might mitigate the miss problem it seems like you're concerned about.  You might have to replace some paragon path AP powers that replicate this.  It also gives AP some use in skill challenges, where the action economy is non-existent.<br><br>If you're trying to add stunts, perhaps "spend an AP and expend an encounter or daily to use any encounter/daily from your class of that level or lower"?  Might be a lot of looking stuff up in books, but probably easier than making up new encounter powers on the spot without making all the classes kind of blur together.<br/><br/>I've considered just adding a second class of AP (Story Points) that don't refresh/reset.

I was very busy yesterday afternoon and evening.  Thanks for all the insightful comments.  I agree with John.  I probably need to spell out what it is I'm attempting to accomplish.<br><br>1.)  One of the things I dislike about D&amp;D of any edition is the whiff factor involved.  As a player you wait 10 minutes for your turn then you roll 1 die and whiff on the attack.  Now you get to wait again and hope you don't whiff next time.<br><br>2.)  Daily Powers should never be totally ineffectual.  They are your big guns and they should do something.  I'm okay with some of the Wizard Powers that do something a little less impressive if you fail but I really hate the Daily Powers that just fizzle because the d20 rolled too low.  Encounter and At-will Powers that do this don't bother me.  Failure in general don't always bother me but the complete failure of a Daily Power is an un-fun failure.  <br/><br/>3.)  Action Points as they are written are fairly lame.  In fact, most of my players completely forget about them unless I remind them.  If you had more AP's and they did more (and more interesting) stuff than just get an extra Standard Action, then maybe they would be worth keeping track of.<br/><br/>Okay.... On to the comments.<br/><br/>I completely forgot about some character classes having a bunch of AOE powers that would require multiple attack rolls per round.  I definitely wouldn't want to give out AP for every single miss.  I also didn't consider players just firing off Minor Actions with the intent of failing in order to get AP.  I will have to rethink that a lot.<br/><br/>I'm not really worried about the players getting too many actions.  They can still only spend 1 AP per turn.  That means they get 1 extra Standard Action.  If they use their AP for the Standard Action, then they can't use their AP for anything else that turn, including a Second Wind.  This is why I'm not worried about someone dumping 10 AP to get a +10d8 to damage.  You can only spend 1 AP per turn (at Heroic Tier anyways).<br/><br/>I am a little concerned about affecting the Leader characters abilities.  Here's the tradeoff.  If I spend an AP to get a Second Wind then I can't do anything else that turn.  Remember, I can't take the AP to get an extra Standard Action and then take a Second Wind.  I can only spend 1 AP per round.  If the Leader character takes an action that give me the use of a healing surge, I still have my regular action and the use of my AP for something else during the round.  I'm just not certain how that tradeoff will work out in actual play.  Will the lure of using AP for something else be enough to keep the Leader character's abilities relevant or not?<br/><br/>Thanks again for the responses.<br/><br/>Andrew                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294615/#Comment_294615" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-25T21:22:48+00:00" title="September 25, 2010  9:22PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2010 8:03AM by johnzo.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>3.)

Think of them as extra move actions instead, or perhaps an extra in-combat skill roll, and look for opportunities to provoke their use in that way.<br/><br/>Try to spread the characters out and then look to create crises or opportunities in the encounter, where an extra action is critical to success.  Death saves are the best example -- I think the  most exciting play in D&amp;D is when a player spends an action point on a double move and a Heal roll-to-stabilize, or (even better) a triple-move and a healing minor.<br/><br/>Ticking-bomb skill challenges are another good opportunity to provoke AP usage.  Give the characters some things to do in the encounter besides kill the monsters, and suddenly action points can become very important indeed.<br/><br/>That said, our table does use the Elven Accuracy hack, allowing action points to be used for straight rerolls.<br/><br/>Looking at your proposed hacks -- I would be hesitant to allow extra healing opportunities into the game.  Extra player healing = DM grind.  I might just be paranoid, though, because our party has a full leader (Warlord), a hybrid leader (Bard) and a multiclass leader (Warlord) and I have a hell of a time knocking anyone in our party down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294709/#Comment_294709" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T23:06:34+00:00" title="September 26, 2010 11:06PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite>3.)

It would essentially compress more action into less time.  While that may impact the relative values making some things worth more and others less, that would be no different than now where you have to judge every time to take a new power or utility or feat what the relative value for that is.  Since all of the powers and such are only half assed balanced to begin with, I don't see this as all that damaging.<br/><br/>That said, Andrew I'd recommend the following changes to you <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.<br/><br/>for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> Second Wind, I'd make it take all of your accumulated APs to do.  Choosing when and when not to take your Second Wind should be a choice not made easily.  By the time you need it you will probably have more than one so the desire to maybe delay your Second Wind until you can spend some of those other APs on cooler stuff should make for an interesting trade off.  I don't think this will over shadow the healer role, though it should make healer light parties more viable choices.<br/><br/>For <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> the damage boost, I'd stick with using whatever damage die you use for your basic attack.  A Slayer throwing a d12 should get more bang for that AP buck than a Rogue throwing a d8...just like different classes get more bang for their Healing Surge.<br/><br/>on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>, I'm not sold on refreshing Dailies.  Unless you actually trying to hack the Short Rest vs. Extended Rest model, I think allowing APs to refresh Dailies is probably too much.  The choice between getting an Encounter Power back or taking a second action though I think is one that is balanced, in the sense that in some situations one will be clearly better, while in others, others will be clearly better.<br/><br/>Would spending an AP to Aid Another be a good use here?

I understand whiffing is frusterating (believe me, do I understand - a monk I recently started has a great encounter power, which hasn't hit yet - 1,2,5,6 - I'm hoping there's some kind of progression there), but I'm very skeptical of approaches which ameliorate this by fiddling with game mechanics.  The possibility of missing is an essential part of the tactical properties of the game.  If you get rid of it, what would you do for Avengers - whose striker ability is based on having higher accuracy than everyone else?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile D&amp;D is certainly not perfectly balanced, I think it would be a big mistake to assume that it wasn't a lot of work to get it as balanced as it is.  A lot of the suggested AP uses don't seem to understand this:<br/>\n1) Standard Action<br/>\n  What APs do now - giving players an extra standard action every time they whiff would significantly increase their damage output.  You can compensate for that partially by increasing monster hps, or increasing the number of monsters, but that will reduce the size of the sweet spot between trivial fights and party kills.<br/>\n2) Second Wind<br/>\n  Second wind is largely only used by Dwarves anyway.  Changing it to an AP cost would reduce the strength of Dwarves a bit, but that's not necessarily a bad idea - Dwarves are very strong as it is.  Other than dwarves, I don't see this option being widely used.<br/>\n3) d8 damage<br/>\n  If your character can't do quite a bit more expected damage on a standard action than d8, then it is significantly underperforming.  (And rather impressively so - I believe you would need to deliberately design a poor character before an additional d8 damage would be a better option).  More generally, you can't use a single value here because it will need to increase as players average damage increases.  Assuming you did find some point at which it was approximately as useful as a second action, you would make this option overpowered for critfishers, and incredibly overpowered for coup-de-grace (There's a 9th level rogue daily that knocks the target out - a crit specializer (RRoT build, maybe) would be easily able to one-shot monsters using this option)<br/>\n4) +2 defenses<br/>\n  Very weak - and also redundant, considering that I could just use an extra standard action to do the Total Defense action .  (I have never seen anyone use Total Defense)<br/>\n5) Refresh Daily<br/>\n  Ridiculously overpowered.  Dailies are good.  They are literally fight-changing.  If players are able to use them like encounter powers by spending action points, then you will need to hugely increase the difficulty levels of your encounters (to the point that a slightly challenging encounter for a party which can spend APs for dailies would be a guaranteed TPK for a party which can't).  Party composition would have a big effect here too - daillies which are intended to heal the party can have a stronger effect than dailies which are intended to do damage.  Here's just a sample of the things you might have to deal with when dailies can be refreshed like that:<br/>\n   Everyone in the party has resist 5 to everything, all the time.<br/>\n   Every enemy starting it's turn next to the fighter takes d12+4 damage, automatically<br/>\n   The cleric's healing powers always heal an additional 5 damage<br/>\n   The entire party receives a +4 to hit the big bad guy for the entire encounter<br/>\n   There is a 5x5 cloud of poison that the wizard controls that automatically damages everything starting in it<br/>\n   (Those are all level 1-5, cause I'm most familiar with heroic tier - just for fun, here's some level 29:<br/>\n    The fighter deals +1W damage on all at-wills and encounters, and automatically attacks every enemy that starts it's turn adjacent<br/>\n    The warlock can control at least the standard action (and possibly all the actions) of one of the enemies<br/>\n    Everyone has +4 to all defenses, and resist 5 to all damage<br/>\nThere are 2 problems with this increase in power - firstly, it makes it harder to balance fights, since you also need to increase the monsters power to match.  Secondly, it's even harder to balance fights because you can't count on the party having those particular powers (strikers especially, tend to have dailies which are more devoted to damage, which are less susceptible to abuse in this way.  The rules as written have this reasonably balanced with other dailies, but once you increase the number of uses available, the balance gets broken).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI've spent a lot of time writing all this down, so obviously, you've pushed a button in me :)  I'll see if I can try to summarize.<br/>\n1) Whiffing is frustrating, but it's a fundamental part of the system.<br/>\n2) D&amp;D, while not perfectly balanced, is very well balanced for such a complex system.  This was not easy to achieve. *<br/>\n  2a) One of it's features is the ability to create relatively balanced encounters very easily<br/>\n3) Trying to remove the whiff factor by a minor change to the rules is practically guaranteed to fail, either by breaking the balance, or by not   <br/>\n  actually removing the whiff factor - removing the whiff factor would take a lot of work.<br/>\n4) This is not a weakness of D&amp;D, it's just how they chose to design the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf whiffing in D&amp;D is a big enough problem for you, you should probably look for a different system.  If you stick within the system, there are some alternatives for you which tend to reduce the whiff factor.  Play an avenger (make 2 rolls for attacks against one target you chose), an elf (reroll 1 attack once per encounter) or use an inescapable magic weapon (every time you miss you get a cumulative +1 to hit).  It would probably not be unbalanced to make the elf ability available as a feat as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for going on at such length.  I enjoy D&amp;D, and while I'm ok with people who don't enjoy it I'm obviously very worried (and I'm not sure why) that someone is going to make a 'minor' tweak and then complain when it breaks horribly.  Thanks for bearing with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Part of my perspective on this comes from previous editions of D&amp;D, in which it was possible for one character to make the entire rest of the party irrelevant.  In the current edition one character can be stronger than another, but they will still be significantly weaker than 2 others.  Everyone in the party is guaranteed to be making a significant contribution to the success of the party.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294829/#Comment_294829" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T16:10:41+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  4:10PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grover, I think you're missing at least some of the point.

Monsters have far far too many hps as it is so "compensating" by increasing hps is WAY not desired.  You could simply cut the HPs of all monsters in half and call it a day...but that doesn't add any excitement.  Doubling the damage output does the same thing with the added fun of super cool guy combos of death.  Death by attrition is not heroic.  Death by inflicting catastrophic amounts of damage is heroic.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">2) Second Wind<br/>\nSecond wind is largely only used by Dwarves anyway.

Using it as a minor action certainly makes it alot easier for Dwarves to crank through them, but perhaps you've been playing in healer heavy parties.

Whiffing is not a fundamental part of the system...where fundamental = designed on purpose because its more fun that way.  Whiffing is an artifact of how the game derived from table top minis.  In mini wargames you had two basic resolution types.  1) Ye olde tables, precursors to the hoary CRTs of wargame fame and 2) Fiat.  Fiat was actually the more common in refereed games (at least in the circles I've traveled in) where the ref would just decide...what made sense.  This is actually how Arneson drove alot of Blackmoor play back in the day.  Dice were introduced to add more of a risk element but unlike with wargames where some minis always died it was just a question of how many, the dice mechanic introduced in original D&amp;D; was of the "hit or miss" variety.  If you read some of the history of Blackmoor you'll see that it was not "designed" so much as "cobbled together" piecemeal over many a session.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey didn't "choose to design" 4E that way because it was fun.  They chose to design it that way because the d20 was "backwards compatable" and considered part of the D&amp;D; brand identity.  It was something they chose to live with in order to keep continuity with the D&amp;D; brand, not something they did because it worked particularly well for the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhiffage is never good design...ever.  Every edition of D&amp;D; has suffered from it and thus every edition of D&amp;D; has spawned numerous house rules to deal with it.  Whiffage sucks.  It *IS* a weakness of D&amp;D;, always has been.  As proof...look at how many classes and feats 4E came up with to give special "anti-whiffage" powers to.  Cuz it sucks to whiff.  So would changing the game to make whiffing less problematic for everyone (rather than those who choose to opitimize a build around it) mean that some of those anti-whiffing builds are no longer as effective as they used to be...sure.  Absolutely...so what.  Right now there are ass kicking builds and not so ass kicking builds.  You have to judge based on numerous factors (not the least of which is understanding what kind of encounter your DM likes to throw at you) what builds will be effective at your table.  So now that equation changes a little bit.  So what.  You're still picking what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you enjoy waiting 10 minutes to take a turn only to have nothing happen so you can go back to waiting another 10 minutes to take your turn...that's cool.  I don't, at all, ever...I expect something cool to happen every single time I take my turn.  If it doesn't I'm willing to be mollified by the promise that next time my turn will be even cooler.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294836/#Comment_294836" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T17:16:19+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  5:16PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite>As a player you wait 10 minutes for your turn then you roll 1 die and whiff on the attack.

Agree that if someone is going slowly they will get (kindly) yelled at - you've only got 45 minutes! Step 2: after you've played a dozen of these, agree that play-fast is now <i>default</i>, and that everyone will apply social pressure to anyone playing slowly, and follow through, even if you're not in a Timed Delve.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294848/#Comment_294848" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T19:32:37+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  7:32PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2010 7:36PM by Gaerik.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, thanks for all the comments.  Even if I don't mention you specifically I really did read what you wrote and digested what you said.  I may not agree with you but I do appreciate you putting your opinion out there for me to mull over.<br><br>Just to clarify, I think whiffing on Daily Powers is bad.  Whiffing is defined as "having no effect".  I don't mind at-Will and Encounter Powers missing.  I can reuse them fairly quickly.  I think Daily Powers should always do something, even if it is half damage or just secondary effects or something.  I generally get to use them once a session.  They should do something all the time, dammit.<br><br>Numerous people have pointed out that refreshing Daily Powers is too much.  I can see that now.  Thanks for bringing it to my attention.<br><br>Gaining an AP for every miss is a bit much.  I'll be changing this.<br><br>I'm not sure increasing the speed helps after a certain point.  We're already working on keeping the pace up so that things don't drag.  Pushing at it harder would really be a pain and rather un-fun.  A timed delve would be interesting and cool from time to time but when I'm playing my regular game with an ongoing campaign, I like things to move at a little more comfortable pace.<br><br>Here's how I'm thinking of modifying my original changes.<br><br>1.)  You get +1 AP for each failure of an attack power that is at least a Standard Action.  If the power affects more than one target then the power must fail for every target in order to get the +1 AP.  After all, if your power is affecting some of the targets, it isn't failing.<br><br>2.)  You can carry over a number of AP from one encounter to the next equal to the number of healing surges you have used.  An extended rest that refreshes all your healing surges causes you to lose all of your AP except 1.<br><br>3.)  Heroic Tier may spend 1 AP per round.  Paragon may spend 2 per round.  Epic may spend 3 per round.<br><br/>4.)  You may spend AP on the following...<br/>   a.)  Reroll a roll.<br/>   b.)  Refresh an Encounter Power.<br/>   c.)  +2d8 damage.<br/>   d.)  a free Standard Action<br/>   e.)  Use your Second Wind by spending all your current AP.<br/><br/>I'm still looking at c.) above.

When my choices lead to suck that's bad play, that's getting schooled.  When random dice lead to suck...that's lame.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have a roll and there is a binary outcome and 1 outcome is "Something Cool Happens" and the other outcome is "nothing happens at all" that is a design that is inherently vulnerable to whiffage.<br/>\nWhen that roll is mechanized such that there is a high degree of unpredictability inherent in the outcome (such as the linear probability scale along the wide range of a d20 vs. the bell curve of GURPS or FUDGE) that mechanic is inherently vulnerable to whiffage.<br/>\nWhen you call for a die roll repeatedly during the game because you're essentially recreating the probability curve of a die pool by rolling a series of individual dice, that mechanic is inherently vulnerable to whiffage.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you put all three of those things together in a game...whifftasticness commences.  Basic Role Playing (BRP) suffers all of these same problems substituteing the linear curve of an even wider range %ile for the d20.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMissing a roll is not itself whiffing.  Missing for a completely random reason (regardless of how skillfully you played to optimize your odds) that results in nothing interesting happening usually is.  As evidence witness the typical  D&amp;D; game where a missed roll is responded to with nothing more interesting than "That sucks, who's next in the Initiative"...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe granting of an AP on a miss doesn't magically transform a miss into something interesting, that would take a much larger reengineering to accomplish.  What it does is give you a rain check.  Rather than "that sucks, nothing interesting happens on your turn" you get "ok, nothing interesting happened on your turn, but here's a rain check that increases the likelihood of something even more interesting happening on a future turn, sorry for the inconvenience thanks for shopping at Dungeons 'R Us".  Not quite the same thing, but easy to implement without a complete overhaul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grover" title="Grover"><img alt="Grover" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grover">Grover</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295042/#Comment_295042" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T16:39:56+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  4:39PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What would be a better alternative?
