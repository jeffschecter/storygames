Maybe it's just that you're a charismatic podcaster and feel uncomfortable personally with some of the attention you get at cons because you are also humble.<br/><br/>One of many really neat things about this community is that we have the opportunity to sit down and play games with the people that made them.  Or talk with them on forums.<br/><br/>What kinds of activities/behaviors would you like to see more/less of that would mitigate some of these uncomfortable feelings?<br/><br/>I know you don't want to drag designers or podcasters down.  I tried to necro that awesome players thread a while back, but it didn't really take.

I agree entirely.<br/><br/>So here's a thing: people who have a lot in common tend to become friends, right? And people who are embarked on similar artistic agendas tend to talk to each other about what they're doing. I don't know why it's a surprise to anyone that a bunch of folks (myself included, of course) who are doing the same thing in the same geographical region know each other, like each other and play games with each other.<br/><br/>I mean, I moved to Chicago and literally didn't know anyone in this city except one friend from high school (who's an actor), and four game designers that I've met through conventions. Why is it surprising that I'd hang out with those guys? And, y'know, play some games with them?<br/><br/>Hold on, I have an idea for a thread.

Unless you're playing FreeMarket.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, designers are special... at designing. I think it would be weird if people were all like, Jared is so good at design, I bet he would be good in bed. Now that's weird!<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that great players are easily overlooked for what makes them special. It's harder to point to and share what makes them special unless you play with them. So they get less attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said (and some game designers may want to slap me for saying this) I think many hardcore RPG gamers are beginning game designers in the making or hope to be, so active designers get special attention from them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289405/#Comment_289405" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T14:20:46+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  2:20PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Judd%E2%80%94To">@Judd\u2014To</a> be honest, I felt kind of uncomfortable <i>starting</i> that thread, but felt compelled to, as kind of a check-in.   Also, admittedly, as a reaction against all the designer-bashing from JD and others.<br><br><a href="/forums/profile/Jenskot%E2%80%94And">@Jenskot\u2014And</a> yeah, all those designers are friends or at least acquaintances\u2014in fact, that's kind of the point.  They're not better than me even if I admire the designs they've done and what they've contributed to gaming through their work.  I feel pretty confident that I'm doing my part too: by GMing and facilitating a lot of games, introducing both new gamers and veterans to new ways of thinking.  But while I don't deify designers, I do respect what they do and think it has importance and what they intend shouldn't casually be tossed aside as it often is.<br><br>I dunno.  Lately I've just been frustrated by a lot of misinterpretations of games\u2014here, and in real life.  Knowing the game's designer or having played the game with them doesn't necessarily prevent all such erroneous implementations, of course, but it can really help to internalize a game's design or to clear up questions about how the rules are intended (there's that word, sorry, but it is actually relevant) to work.  Like, wow, it really is that simple, or even, wow that one thing really is kind of counterintuitive but works well when you do it that way.<br><br>Knowing or playing with a lot of designers isn't all that unusual in this community and shouldn't necessarily be a means of gaining status.  But I do think it confers a measure of credibility when discussing games and their designs.  I think I'm saying something like, "I'm part of this community, and I get what these games are about and how they work."<br/><br/>Matt                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289410/#Comment_289410" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T14:42:31+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  2:42PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>I wasn't at all trying to criticize you for starting the thread, more about what it became and it piled on other behaviors I have observed over yonder years.<br/><br/>I don't want to make it all about your thread anymore than I want to make it about bending the knee to the Burning Lord, Luke Crane, long may he reign from BWHQ.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289416/#Comment_289416" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T15:02:19+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  3:02PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, "Burning Lord," I like that sound of that.

I don't know, it seemed pretty straightforward to me. If that's not what it was, though, I don't get what's wrong with getting excited about knowing or playing games with people who make things we like. Like, George R. R. Martin wrote some books that I loved and if I got to meet him and talk to him about those books that would be really cool. When I first got into indie gaming and found games that let me play the types of games I've always wanted to play, it made me really enthusiastic about meeting the people who made them (I will not name them lest it put them on a pedestal).<br/><br/>This seems like stomping on people's enthusiasm just in case the dread STATUS GAMES start rearing up their head. It's cool to play games with the designers. It's cool to play with other people too. The difference is we can have a conversation about gaming with those designers because their heads poke up out of the crowd. I can't talk to you about gaming with my friend Shael because you don't know who he is (well, you do, but most people don't).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289442/#Comment_289442" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T16:10:02+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  4:10PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2010 4:13PM by Teataine.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's great people get excited about stuff. Even irrationally so. Of course we could descend into some spiralling debate about the enlightement and the evil of cults of personality and totalitarisms but I think that's really stretching it.<br/><br/>I was never a real fanboy of anything. I don't want to be, I don't feel the need. Fanboys ruin everything. But I have often felt a great respect or perhaps some deep mutual understanding for people who created things that resonated with me. Burroughs and Ulver being two. It's not a rational thing. Art is about barring emotions and ideas and sometimes those hit all the right chords with another person, and that's great. <br/><br/>Games aren't art, I don't think so, but we share a lot with writers or moviemakers. Or even musicians. And just like when you watch a brilliant movie that resonates with you, you want to go to the person who made it and say "Holy shit man, you've done a <i>great thing</i>." <br/><br/>Maybe it challenges you, maybe it makes you think, maybe it makes you feel funny, maybe it's just beautiful, or fun or even meaningful or whatever. The bottom line is, it excites you. Excitement makes you get up, do things, talk to people, make stuff. And sometimes it makes you act stupid.<br/><br/>Still, thank you, Wo/Man Who Made Something Exciting. Thank you for making that thing.

Partially because it's funny to see his face when I ask, partially because it turns the game into not just a game, but a fond reminder. I have a signed copy of Mist-Robed Gate, and I'm <i>married</i> to the author. It's one of my most treasured books.<br/><br/>That said, I get where you're coming from, because signing books always feels a little surreal. I always do it when asked, but I never offer, because it's important to me to interact with people who are interested in my games as enthusiastic peers, and not as fans. That's why my email address is in every book, and why I'm playing Blowback on Skype with whoever asks. I want to talk about stuff and have fun with people who share my interests. <br/><br/>Back to the OP: with most of my friends who designed games, I was friends with them before I ever really interacted with them in design terms or played their games. I don't think of them as game designers except when I'm engaging in their games or talking design with them. But I don't think there's any problem with me being excited that I get to play games I love with the people I admire who made them, any more than there's a problem with me going WOOOOOOO while applauding after my brother does a set with his band.<br/><br/>Frankly, I think there's a problem when it's WEIRD to be excited to enjoy something a friend made with them. It's like if I go over to Joshua's house and he made carbonara, and I'm like FUCK YES CARBONARA and then I'm like "Wait, let me go eat this on the porch so it doesn't look like I'm idolizing you for being a badass chef."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289495/#Comment_289495" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T22:25:57+00:00" title="August 28, 2010 10:25PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Folks,<br/><br/>I don't think its weird to like to meet people who create cool shit.<br/><br/>I don't think its weird to enjoy playing a game with someone who made the game.<br/><br/>There is something deeper at work, here and that thread just kind of reminded me of it.<br/><br/>I see it more in podcasts, when podcasters treat designers with kid-gloves and are too in awe to properly question them or challenge their ideas or disagree at all.<br/><br/>I am having trouble putting words to it but I know that plenty of people are whispering to me and saying that they are seeing it around too.<br/><br/>So, I ask that you please read charitably, don't assume I think that its lame and/or strange if you like X or Y designer's work, or e-mail them and tell them that their game rocks or get a book signed.

Something about it bugged me but my criticism is not leveled at anyone who posted in that thread, nor with the awesome guy who started it.  <br><br>So, our hobby is absolutely about people connecting.  It is about that when we sit to game, it is about that when we sit down to type about gaming and send it out onto the internets.  I get that.  I have seen and experienced and am in love with that journey where I connect with someone on a forum, IM with 'em, talk to them, meet them at a con, share meals with them and game with them and become friends with them.  That is a nice thing, in all of its forms with all manner of gamers.<br/><br/>I am not someone saying that there is "something wrong with the community" and crossing my arms and making dire pronouncements with monkey poo flinging.  I am not someone who comes to Story Games once a year to tell everyone here how wrong they are.<br/><br/>What I was talking about, with the pedestals and the bending of the knee to the Burning Lord is a feeling I get.  It is something I don't want to be solved or killed or stopped.  I don't want any one person to stop any one thing.  Elizabeth's dinners at Joshua's house are safe.  Everyone's signed copies of games can be spared the Bradburian fireman (especially the books signed by game designers that I have on my shelf).  <br/><br/>I just want the idea that hierarchy putting designers over gamers is bullshit and stupid.  I want to just look over at that hierarchy and let it know that we are watching it.  On a personal level, I want to find more time to celebrate play and find new ways to do so.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289506/#Comment_289506" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T23:00:53+00:00" title="August 28, 2010 11:00PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "working on my <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">screenplay</span> game"<br/><br/>This so needs to be a shirt.<br/><br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289507/#Comment_289507" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T23:12:05+00:00" title="August 28, 2010 11:12PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd can you point to something specific that typifies what you're getting at?

Before Gamestorm, when I knew Vincent was coming, internally I was like, "Should I bring Dogs and IAWA and KPFS and get him to sign them? That would be awesome!" Then I decided against it, mostly for ego reasons, because I wanted to seem cool and normal and just treat him like a dude. I don't regret that decision, and I think I'll forego getting designers to sign my games in the future*, but I also realize that a large part of my decision was just ego, like, "I want to look cool to Vincent." Which is probably worse than just asking him to sign my game.<br/><br/>And Judd: Woo! Great stuff, man. Love it.<br/><br/>*I think I'd treasure much more getting a picture with them.

Here's are the bullet points:<br/><br/>* I get the impression that somehow folks have gone from "System Matters" to "Design Matters" to "Designer Matters".<br/><br/>* In the functional sense of "thinking about and doing game design, like tweaking or creating rules or settings" most people here do game design.<br/><br/>* Yet the label is applied only to people who want to write up their designs for other people to use. (Which is cool, I like it when people do that.)<br/><br/>Finally:<br/><br/>The AW Tone thread is an excellent example of the authority of "game designer" in action:<br/><br/>In <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=288861" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=288861</a>\n<blockquote><cite>Will Hindmarch</cite>I'll bet the game is sturdier than it purports to be. I'll bet I can rename all the stats and classes and moves, change the tone a bit, and the thing will still run. Otherwise I'd run the thing ASAP to test it out, but that I'm not that interested in another dusty-wasteland vision of the apocalypse right now. I'm much more interested in this thing's thrumming engine than I am in its attitude.</blockquote>\nSometime later, in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=289034" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=289034</a>\n<blockquote><cite>Sage</cite>If these rules seem to constraining, maybe it's a way of figuring out it's not the game for you. Will, do you think it would be possible for another game with similarly specific GM moves to work for you?"</blockquote>\n(Not to pick on Sage in particular, this was just such a great example.)<br/><br/>Seems like a total disconnect to me.<br/><br/>People know not to say BadWrongFun, but at the same time they are inclined to offer <i>another game</i> instead of talking about <i>deconstructing or tweaking the setting or the rules</i>. The only exceptions to this seem to be threads with "Let's hack X" or "My Game, Please Comment" in the title.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm misreading this, but every time I see this happening it, I see the cult of the designer in action. The idea that you need someone else to design the game in order for you to play it. The desire to customize is seen as an illness instead of a virtue.<br/><br/>Not everyone does it, and probably most people who do it don't mean anything by it. It's still tremendously irritating to read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289539/#Comment_289539" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T05:47:54+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  5:47AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Judd.

Of course, you can get this simply by playing with people outside of your regular groups--I played a game of 3:16 with Tony Dowler that transformed the way I saw that game significantly--but there's something special about sitting down with the original creator and gleaning some new insights.

Based on the threads that have gone on in the past, I think this is something a lot more people are interested in but nobody knows how to really fix it. The different contests centered around play have been cool, but they get nowhere near the attention of a game design contest (unless a noteable game design or podcasting personality participates in them), and there was just a thread where people were saying they don't like reading AP.<br><br>How do you celebrate play if it's something for you and your group and is understandably difficult to appreciate by people who were not participants? That's what I keep coming back to whenever I'm trying to 'be the change I want to see in the world' and post about play. Then I pop out an AP post and it sinks away with no responses.<br><br>Edit: I think Game Advocates is the best thing going for this right now.

And it really makes sense if you like a certain type of game, ie, really indie. If you like the types of games that are geared towards one shots but have a rather small target audience, chances go way up that you'll end up playing them with the designers. If you spend a lot of time going to conventions where designers also go to demo their games, chances go up even higher that you'll play them with designers. Now if people start dropping names like Rob Heinsoo, Gary Gygax, Jeff Grubb, Kevin Siembieda, Sean Punch, Mike Mearls, Monte Cook and such names of designers they've played with that might be a bit unusual, but if you've played a bunch of games by designers nobody's heard of until you mention it - what's out of the ordinary about that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289616/#Comment_289616" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T13:53:15+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  1:53PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Judd ... you're someone who people probably know from the internet before having met you in person (thanks, of course, to the greatest RPG podcast of all time).

They consider it fun and rewarding, and their time is theirs to spend. Telling them not to tinker because they are not game designers writing games for other people to play is borderline offensive. It's like saying "You should not swim if you don't do scuba!" - nikodemus<br/>\n<br/>\nWell sure some people are interested in balancing a game, we call them game designers...<br/>\n<br/>\nThats not me being exclusive, that is me being as inclusive as possible. Even if your just tweaking a game someone else built you are engaged in game design and are for that time a game designer yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n"People know not to say BadWrongFun, but at the same time they are inclined to offer another game instead of talking about deconstructing or tweaking the setting or the rules. The only exceptions to this seem to be threads with "Let's hack X" or "My Game, Please Comment" in the title.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I'm misreading this, but every time I see this happening it, I see the cult of the designer in action. The idea that you need someone else to design the game in order for you to play it. The desire to customize is seen as an illness instead of a virtue." -nikodemus<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it's a misread, some people dont want to spend the time it takes to balance or make a game, for them it's work they are not interested in. some people also feel modifying the work of another is either not worth the time (find something else or start from scratch) or maybe even a little strange or weird like editing a movie for TV.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289711/#Comment_289711" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T23:10:28+00:00" title="August 29, 2010 11:10PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>I think Judd's warnings are on target.  The storygames/indie scene in our hobby sometimes feels very much like high school to me, with a group of cool kids and then a lot of other kids trying to get into that group by doing and acting in ways they think the cool kids will like.  It's not always like that and that doesn't negate the great amount of actual gaming and gaming ideas that also exist in the scene here.  But it's there and I am far from alone in being aware of it and not liking it and it is not like that in the various other sectors of the hobby.<br><br>edit: to put it even more broadly, social stuff seems more important than gaming stuff.

It's more about a dominant culture with hierarchies of acceptance.  If you don't see it, you may be just oblivious to those things or so deep in it that you can't see it.  I'm being very vague and general because it's not all pervasive or obvious, but it's there.  <br/><br/>One specific example that is rather trivial, but mildly annoying is this new trend of swearing and using super aggressive cartoony language to describe one's enthusiasm (often for someone, quite often a designer).  This seems to be a cultural behaviour very specific to this board.  If you speak this way, you will be more easily accepted, your posts may get more responses.  We don't say "I just played a great session of Freemarket."  We have to say "Fucking Luke Crane and Jared Sorenson stepped out of the Freemarket box and curb-stomped my fucking brain with awesome!"<br/><br/>Again, a minor example, but it is specific.  I could continue with more substantive examples, of the way certain things are emphasized, of ensuring to include one's own liberal personal values in posts.  The point is that certain behaviours are rewarded and while this is always the case in any community, the behaviours here are narrower and tend to be social when compared to other gaming sites on the internet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289821/#Comment_289821" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T09:31:35+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  9:31AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can start an even bigger fight by saying "I fixed Freemarket and it worked great!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290169/#Comment_290169" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T19:27:01+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  7:27PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 7:27PM by DannyK.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Waiting for Lumpley</span>, a play in one act<br/><br/>Vladimir: Why can't we just play the game right now?<br/>Estragon: The designer will be here soon, he will run it for us.<br/>Vladimir: We've been waiting a very long time.

It was all cute and enthusiastic. We would decorate, we would prepare food, we would write scenarii to be played with the popular games of the time. The reasoning behind the scenarii was that local game stores wanted to sponsor our little event but they mostly wanted to give gaming material rather than money. We sure could have handed out these books and accessories through a lottery but it wouldn't have been very exciting or made anyone feel special. A lottery wouldn't have channeled the enthusiasm of our little community. Instead we made it a competition. That was it! All we needed was some referees to walk around and observe every tables and a spreadsheet to rate players and GMs (for instance how good is a GM at describing, impersonating NPCs, keeping the players excited, using rules without breaking the flow etc..)<br/><br/>It was an interesting experiment. It was far from perfection, and all of us knew it. There was a good dose of rating people you knew better than others. Or rating tables playing your favorite game better than others. But in the end it felt like we were indeed celebrating gamers. And a few strangers managed to impress everybody with their awesomeness, leading to more contacts and cross group pollination. And it wasn't at odd with celebrating our special guest, game designers or illustrators who accepted an invitation.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's the only way to celebrate players, but it's possible to bring the spotlight on them. 15 minutes of nerd fame if you want <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290319/#Comment_290319" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T07:28:05+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  7:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>If you can have one of two badges, "I've touched Jared Sorensen" or "Jared Sorensen has touched me", which would you choose?</blockquote>\nI would not have to choose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290327/#Comment_290327" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T07:55:38+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  7:55AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><br/>I just want the idea that hierarchy putting designers over gamers is bullshit and stupid.

And though I talk in a funny voice, I'm serious here. Really I am. And the more I say I am, the less you'll believe me. Count your spoons but do not question my honor.<br/><br/>You know what? I think game designers ought to be put on a pedestal. Not a very tall one. Like four or five inches high. Because they did something cool and we should recognize that. Fuck this idea that they're just gamers like the rest of us. They're not. <br/><br/>You know how hard it is to make a decent game? We all like to say that anyone can design a game. That's true. It's true the way that anyone can learn calculus, become a fireman, or get a hole in one. With a tremendous amount of work, a ton of skill, a lot of luck, and a certain amount of innate fucking ability, you too can be a game designer. In other words, it's really fucking hard.<br/><br/>If people want to celebrate that a little bit, that's all right by me. I don't know what you mean by "hierarchy putting designers over gamers." I have never seen that. I didn't see that in Matt's thread. Not in any power-control way. I saw homage. I saw respect. I saw a certain amount of hero worship, but it seemed healthy. When I go to conventions, I don't really see any hero worship or bended-knee bullshit. Is this a real problem?<br/><br/>Personally, I have tremendous respect for many designers, but never feel like I can't approach them because of it. There's one designer with whom I haven't talked much because I can't figure him out as a person.

I'd be comfortable asking any other designer to do the same.

We even have little tags on our event web pages saying "Designer Event: This game is written and published by the organizer, giving you a unique opportunity to experience the game exactly as it was designed!". We purposely make a Big Deal out of playing a game with its designer.<br/><br/>Yet, I totally agree with Judd that it's a bit ridiculous to hold game designers in higher esteem than fans that run kick-ass games. The design is only a small part of the equation for a great game. The organizer's experience, prep, delivery, and management of the session is contributing far more, and some designers are actually not exceptional at this, believe it or not.<br/><br/>In our defense, when we get a designer to come out and run their own game, we can be assured of a few things:<br/><br/>* The organizer will know the rules of their game and know how to best teach and adjudicate them<br/>* The organizer will know the intricacies of their game, where it works best, and where it doesn't work as well, and can shape the session accordingly<br/>* The organizer won't misrepresent the game due to having experienced it in a different culture of play than the designer<br/>* Most importantly, the organizer has a tangible reason for running an entertaining session, financial or otherwise<br/><br/>When we stick this tag on one of our events, we confer this assurance to the players interested in the game. It's less about fostering a cult of personality and more about highlighting events we know are going to kick ass. Now, we have a pretty good-sized squadron of people that we know to be terrific organizers, and who represent the games they run at <i>least</i> as well as the designers would, as well - it's just harder to quantify their credentials in public without implicitly questioning the competency of the rest of the organizers we haven't seen wow us yet.<br/><br/>I'm in favour of the short pedestal Adam talks about; after all, game designers do have something quantifiable we can look at with respect. That doesn't diminish the glory that ought to be heaped upon people who organize or participate in terrific game sessions, or otherwise make the hobby go 'round.<br/><br/>Oh, Lacuna is an awesome game, <i>and</i> Jared is <i>great</i> in bed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290541/#Comment_290541" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T13:55:14+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  1:55PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ironically, I am doing the same at RinCon.<br/><br/>"Give the suckers, I mean the people, what they want!"<br/><br/><img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290546/#Comment_290546" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T13:58:36+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  1:58PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2010 3:45PM by johnzo.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course great players can't be as celebrated as great designers, because of the simple fact that great players influence a table at a time.

There are two things going on.  One is that a designer has created something that people enjoy and demonstrates his or her skills.  It's also a contribution to the community.  I don't think anyone thinks there is anything wrong with giving them props for that and having them earn our respect and appreciation.<br/><br/>The issue that I see in this community is a social one, where there is a hierarchy of relationships and status and being a designer automatically puts you way up on that hierarchy.  And then people behave in certain ways either to get up there themselves or to be included in the social group that hangs out up there.  This is all pretty natural stuff in any community, but that's not to say it doesn't have harmful effects.<br/><br/>Some of the harmful effects that I see here are a very strong barrier to entry to newcomers who are not naturally socially aggressive.  If you don't already have some kind of social connection or reputation in the community, your posts and ideas will often not receive a sufficient level of attention and response.  If you don't adjust your language and content to fit certain values and expectations, likewise your posts and ideas will not be well received.  Again, this is not unique to this community, but this kind of exclusivity is quite high relative to the rest of the gaming community.  I get around and this board is far and away the most intimidating and discouraging for newbies.  I'm a braying loudmouth who sticks his foot in the door of the party and starts yelling until I get in a fight or make friends, so I can get beyond it.  But I know at least two other really intelligent gamers who are way into storygames who came here and left very quickly because of feeling basically not welcome and have heard similar comments from many others in passing.<br/><br/>Threads like the one about which games you have played with the designer reinforce the impression of a clique with a fairly steep social hierarchy, where you need to be travelling in the same circles, on the internet or in meatspace, of certain groups in order for your voice to have value here.<br/><br/>On the other hand, not to harsh on everybody too much, there is a certain level of discourse that this board has reached over time that is not something one can just pick up over night.  So I do think the hierarchy can also be seen as a meritocracy where people who have spent the time learning and gaming will have more relevant and interesting things to say.  Obviously, people who have actually designed games are going to be pretty smart and experienced about that stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/planetary" title="planetary"><img alt="planetary" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://whatarises.com/~jason/bokeh32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/planetary">planetary</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291002/#Comment_291002" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T21:00:03+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  9:00PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            April, 2008:  <a href="http://theoryfromthecloset.com/2008/04/07/show034-the-toxicity-of-status/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://theoryfromthecloset.com/2008/04/07/show034-the-toxicity-of-status/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/reaction" title="reaction"><img alt="reaction" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/reaction">reaction</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291008/#Comment_291008" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T21:50:04+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  9:50PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Why should that that matter?</blockquote>Well, it hasn't.

This was before the Sons of Kryos, before the Dictionary of Mu.  I was some dude who posted too much at RPG.net, who loved to play games and write about it.<br/><br/>And I was honestly treated like a damned rock star.  And I was treated like a rock star/long lost brother for playing games and posting about my problems and my successes enthusiastically and eloquently.  <br/><br/>My creating this thread might just be my own guilt at not somehow paying that forward, for not creating some kind of new way to share AP, some kind of monumental site where AP could be somehow gathered.  Maybe...<br/><br/>I don't know.  I am going to leave the thread alone for a while.<br/><br/>Thanks, folks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291034/#Comment_291034" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T05:28:50+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  5:28AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I don't know, SG seems kind of schizophrenic about AP.

reports takes time, we don't read many, only those that"</blockquote>\nYeah, that's pretty much what I saw, too.  Not a lot of people saying there was no point in reading or posting AP reports, just a lot of people complaining that they only enjoy reading particular <i>types</i> of AP reports, in direct response to a question asking them what makes them not want to read AP.  And a lot of people were quick to point out things that they like seeing in AP reports, which wouldn't happen if people were "seeing no point in reading or posting AP."  Quite the contrary: it's pretty obvious that even in the worst possible interpretation of that thread that they DO see a point in it, they just don't think most AP is hitting that target.<br/><br/>It was also pretty obvious that whatever that target is varies from person to person.  What bores the crap out of me might be fascinating to someone else, or might be of value to the author and/or his or her gaming buddies.

I was some dude who posted too much at RPG.net, who loved to play games and write about it.<br/><br/>And I was honestly treated like a damned rock star.  And I was treated like a rock star/long lost brother for playing games and posting about my problems and my successes enthusiastically and eloquently.<br/><br/>My creating this thread might just be my own guilt at not somehow paying that forward, for not creating some kind of new way to share AP, some kind of monumental site where AP could be somehow gathered.  Maybe...<br/><br/>I don't know.  I am going to leave the thread alone for a while.<br/><br/>Thanks, folks.</blockquote>\nJudd, I remember this. It was one of many things that made me feel, at The Forge, like "random guy out of nowhere that nobody cares about". Just because someone else was getting a lot of attention, and I wasn't. <br/><br/>Any kind of status, for anyone, will make someone feel left out. It's taken me years to get to the point where I feel I can post here or at The Forge and feel like I'm kinda-sorta-part of the crowd.

That's a lot to digest. I can see there being a lot of stress or personal difficulty to overcome and post new topics and the like.<br/><br/>I'm hoping to make more threads like "Autumn Gaming" and the like, where people can just post cool stuff to it without feeling that they need to pass through a social gauntlet to do so.<br/><br/>Also, I need to change up the "You need to register to join S-G" page: I still love registration, it does a good job of keeping away flakes or resentful folks looking for a soapbox. It effectively kills spammers dead. But I need to make the message more welcoming, not so much "Post why you think we should let you in", but rather, "This is a Turing test to make sure you're not an MMO gold spammer. But tell us something about yourself so we know where you're coming from."<br/><br/>One of the troubling things I've seen in S-G registration is this: About 60% of the folks join with something to the extent of, "Hey I want to post here", or "I've been lurking, and want to join". But about 40%, and again this is a feeling not a calculation (it could be more) of the reg notes are like, "Hey, I'm working on a game!" "I've got an RPG I'm working on and want feedback!" etc. NOW, most of those people who join iwth the latter might post about their game or whatever, and many stick around to basically talk about Play and stuff like all the rest of us. And yet, joining a community like this, folks have an assumption I'm trying to kill, which is:<br/><br/>1) You have to be working on a design to be noticed/accepted (in fact, recently the opposite is true)<br/>2) That you're going to get solid feedback here (rather than Praxis, The Forge, etc). <br/><br/>I'm still thinking, slowly, of ways to make the site easier for new users to post (threads like the "what are you playing?" "what do you love?" etc are awesome in that regard), cleaning up the feel of the registration page, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291360/#Comment_291360" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T08:48:43+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  8:48AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I'm still thinking, slowly, of ways to make the site easier for new users to post (threads like the "what are you playing?"

Totally not a flame or snark; it just seems really, really apparent to me. The Praxis board is no help either, since it seems like it's pretty technically focused and you don't get the volume of (in Freemarket speak) attaboys you might in here. Honestly I have no idea how you'd ever go about changing SG to address that, since the issue -- easy player access to designers -- is baked into indie-gamer culture. It is, in fact, probably a perfect representation of indie-gamer culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291366/#Comment_291366" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T09:05:56+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  9:05AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We could yell at them more, and call them mean names?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291367/#Comment_291367" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T09:12:26+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  9:12AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's your job, Jason! :-D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291370/#Comment_291370" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T09:18:55+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  9:18AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to get all armchair psychology on anyone, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sometimes</span> when someone thinks they are being made to feel unwelcome, especially in an online place, it's more in their head than anywhere else, you know?<br/><br/>Like, if you post in a thread where some of the participants have shared experiences or a shared history and that stuff is informing how they respond to each other, and you feel like "Hey!

It effectively kills spammers dead. But I need to make the message more welcoming, not so much "Post why you think we should let you in", but rather, "This is a Turing test to make sure you're not an MMO gold spammer. But tell us something about yourself so we know where you're coming from."<br/>...<br/>I'm still thinking, slowly, of ways to make the site easier for new users to post (threads like the "what are you playing?" "what do you love?" etc are awesome in that regard), cleaning up the feel of the registration page, etc.<br/>-Andy</blockquote>\nI actually kind of liked the registration stage of joining the community.  It made me ask myself, why do I want to join this community?  It would be awesome if that answer was defaulted into your user profile page (though still editable).  Too many of the profiles tell you too little (mine included) - that presents more of a barrier to entry to me.  As a fairly new user, I find that everyone here knows each other, yet their profiles are empty - its taking me some time to put together who is who.<br/><br/>As for hierarchy and pedestals, if I don't know the person then I don't want to but if I do then great!  Let me clarify that.  When it comes to creative "celebrities", writers/designers/actors/directors/musicians, I only care about their product - its what I interact with.  I don't want to know more, their humanity distracts from the purity of the awesome that is their product.  On the other hand, if I meet/know/interact with the person (e.g. designer Andrew Looney gave me a pair of tie-dye socks that I wear for good luck when giving talks) then I want to interact with them as friends and equals even if I really respect their creative ability; I respect all my friends for something.<br/><br/>As for autographs, mentioned somewhere above, I don't think that autographs put people on pedestals per se.  Autographs are a long acknowledged means of enhancing the value of a creative work (this work was once held by its creator) which goes back as far the printing press/mass market fabrication.  Its also a way for the creator to give you a more personal relationship with the product.  If I have a game that is signed "to me", then I feel like its not just a copy - its the copy that was meant for me.  By requesting it, I'm requesting a more personal level of involvement in the product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291381/#Comment_291381" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T09:44:59+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  9:44AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, a place with a truly welcoming atmosphere depends on people<i> going out of their way</i> to be welcoming.

I <i>do</i> believe that the SG community, taken as a whole, strongly privileges designers of published, successful, highly thought of games (which, to my mind, is not wrong at all). I <i>don't</i> believe that the SG community strongly privileges "folks who fashion themselves as [designers]". In fact, the "so, I'm working on this game, and it's like d20 fantasy but with this twist, you see" posts tend to get ignored and/or ridiculed to a much greater degree than "hey, what do you think of this house rule" or even "I like to play Jungle Speed, <i>who's with me</i>!!1!" topics.<br/><br/>Which is kind of stupid, and one of the reasons I'm quite self-conscious about discussing my game designs or asking for help with them. I don't think that's just in my own head.<br/><br/>Andy, why not make registrations open, with a Captcha to stop the spammers, but only allow posting in a given thread (like "Who are you?") or forum category (like "Story Games Welcomes...") until such a post has been made and vetted by yourself? I do agree with Marshall that having to write a little bit to let you know what your interests with SG are does help shape the experience of joining and subsequent interaction with the community in a positive way, but I also know people who feel the "application process" is a turn-off and contributes to the notion of Story Games being "exclusive".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291410/#Comment_291410" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T11:06:29+00:00" title="September  3, 2010 11:06AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Brian, a place with a truly welcoming atmosphere depends on people<i>going out of their way</i>to be welcoming.

It is not as obvious how to do this on a board.  On some more traditionally-structured forums, you can have a welcome sub-forum and whenever someone new arrives, everybody says hi and gets them to say a bit about their gaming history.

I'd basically have to turn over the site to someone else at that point.<br/><br/>Plus, I like having the doors there, with the only blockage to getting in being "proving that you're not here to shit on everything" or in more general terms, "Act like a human being for two fucking seconds".

Like if someone comes in and says they're new but want to learn more about scene framing, then people will recommend PTA or BE or whatever.<br/><br/>Sometimes, a new person will hammer at some idea where the fact that they are new really does limit their perspective, and then people will\u2014generally gently\u2014try to help them see things in a new way.  See the recent "I hate dice" thread for an example.  People were very honestly responding that they understood where the OP was coming from, but still felt the OP was limited and incorrect, simply due to not having played many games that *did* have good dice mechanics.<br/><br/>If you actually know way, way more about some particular topic than someone, then I really do think it's okay to base your responses to them on your knowledge, as long as you're not a dick about it.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12847/the-cult-of-the-designer-creator-whatever/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12847/the-cult-of-the-designer-creator-whatever">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12847/the-cult-of-the-designer-creator-whatever/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12847/the-cult-of-the-designer-creator-whatever/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12847%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12847%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
