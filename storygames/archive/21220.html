I wonder how it reads to you (Rob)?<br/><br/>Some other thoughts, in no particular order:<br/><br/>* At the time when Vincent was writing AW, there was a real sense of people being tired of "stake-setting". It really fell out of favour - and, indeed, we can see that most games published since 2009 or so don't have explicit stake-setting. Avoiding it was, I think, a design goal for AW (and DW, of course, inherited that).<br/><br/>I actually think that stake-setting is a wonderfully useful and powerful technique, and shouldn't have been thrown away simply because it was no longer "new and cool", but that's neither here nor there.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why it's specifically a problem with DW/AW, though. Surely you could just announce the outcome of a miss or a 7-9 before you rolled the dice, if you prefer playing that way? Hardly seems like a big deal (although I like the implications of not having to do so - faster gameplay, more uncertainty and occasionally a greater sense of "danger").<br/><br/><i>And the "general case" rule is, of course, Defy Danger. (I'm not sure it's ideal, in the way it's put together, but it's intended as such.)</i><br/><br/>* The mechanical asymmetry of these games IS, indeed, a very intentional feature. Personally, I love this style of play so much that I find it hard to go back to games where the GM has to roll dice. (Unfortunately, it's harder to design for!)<br/><br/>What do you see as the downsides of this kind of asymmetry? You've said it feels odd, but not why or how.<br/><br/>* Although I do think some games develop such a glut of moves that they become hard to remember, I don't think it's too difficult to pare a game down to a small set that you actually use. Treating most non-essential moves as optional works perfectly well, in my experience. (Indeed, I willfully ignore whole subsets of rules when I play AW, and it's never caused any problems - same would go for DW.)<br/><br/>* "The player move triggers always apply, and are not subject to direct GM judgment. The tone-management and fiction-integrity-maintenance role of the GM is dropped, and not directly replaced anywhere."<br/><br/>Well... the set of moves and their triggers *are* the "tone-management and fiction-integrity-maintenance" system in place (along with the GM's wide purview to decide which moves are triggered and when). <br/><br/>They look more objective on paper than they are in actual play, in my experience. For instance, consider the GM's role in deciding whether a PC's attack on an enemy triggers Hack&amp;Slash or not. It's analogous to "setting difficulty" for an action, and determines things like "fiction-integrity-maintenance".<br/><br/>Again, I feel that AW does this better than DW - its moves convey tone much better than DW's, which feel a bit... vague in this sense.<br/><br/>* I agree with many of your other criticisms and notes. In particular:<br/><br/>"The base game, as written, is predominantly about combat and adventure. It has minimal support for social, craft, political etc conflicts." (Very true.)<br/><br/>"The damage system somehow always feels \u201csoft\u201d to me \u2014 it feels as if injuries are not injuries, just some vague idea such." (Indeed. I tried to throw something together for this a while back, though I never got a chance to play with these rules: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/forums/discussion/19273/a-descriptive-damage-hack-for-dungeon-world-world-of-dungeons</a>)<br/><br/>But, mostly, I agree with you here:<br/><br/>"The greatly dislike the clean, friendly, cartoony art. It fees lifeless, sanitised, and active sucks pleasure out of play. [...] As with the art, the writing is sanitised, soft-edged, politically correct."<br/><br/>I don't mind the written style of the rules - I think a friendly and clear tone of voice is a really effective way to convey rules text. However, I feel that the design of the game (not just text, art, but decisions made in design at every level - moves, classes, names, etc) lacks character. It's an incredibly "vanilla", generic fantasy format, and that is very unexciting to me. <br/><br/>There's very little personality to all these little artistic decisions, and for my tastes, it's just not interesting. I much prefer the vivid phantasmagoria of old-school D&amp;D (and new versions which keep that flavour, like LotFP) to the sanitized and cartoonish design of new-school D&amp;D. Dungeon World, unfortunately (for me), takes the latter approach.<br/><br/>I'm sure some people enjoy the style and "Colour" of modern D&amp;D and Dungeon World, but I find it entirely uninspiring. It feels like it needs some spicy sauce on top of all the blandness.<br/><br/>Of course, it's obvious that the authors intended it that way (probably to maximize the game's appeal to a variety of D&amp;D players and/or fantasy fans). They succeeded at doing just that. It's just not to my taste, that's all (and apparently not Rob's, either).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I think those stylistic decisions are just as strongly felt at the design level, particularly when it comes to moves and playbooks. Unlike its parent, Apocalypse World, Dungeon World just seems to lack personality at every level. This either creates or (at least) exacerbates the complaints Rob has listed here, like "tone maintenance". The classes and moves just don't give us much to go on in terms of tone. (Compare Dungeon World's rather anemic name lists to AW's highly colourful, sometimes offensive, and memorable names for a simple example!)<br/><br/>However, it's notable that there have been adaptations of DW's rules to more stylistically 'colourful' games, like Dungeon Planet, so presumably it's not impossible to re-flavour the thing.<br/><br/><i>(Incidentally, if there's someone who just *loves* the colour and stylistic palette of the kind of fantasy presented by Dungeon World, I'd love to hear from them/you.

My answer took form after I read World of Dungeons where all moves get reduced to one (the <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/breakers_wodu_turbo.pdf" rel="nofollow">Turbo version</a> has the same basic rule). Then I added/changed/adjusted a few things:<br/><br/>-On a roll of 2, something threats the whole party (Monster's area attack, enviromental hazzard, fail foward, etc)<br/>-On a roll of 12 an opportunity arises for the whole party (yes and... for all players before the enemy reacts, unless someone rolls a 2)<br/>-If you fail, the GM sets a direct threat to yours or someone else's character, if you fail when rolling against a direct threat your character suffers consequences (wounds, hp loss, etc.)<br/>-I use a scale of difficulty up to 20 and put bonuses on the system high enough to reach 24, but it's just personal choice. It gives me enough space to fit equipment and other bonuses.<br/>-If you like 5e advantage/disadvantage you can give the player another d6 to roll and keep highest/lowest. Somewhat works though the math would need to be checked.<br/>-For the rest you use all the DW tricks you like in the moves... without the moves. So, the roll was close but still a fail? Offer a hard bargain or ugly choice. Succeed by a hair? player gets what they wanted but spends resources, etc.<br/><br/>Basically, if you've got your own way of GMing developed, you can forget about the moves, read the dice as stated in World of Dungeons and apply your own experience to the interpretation. I come up with the stakes on my mind before the player rolls the dice and may or may not tell the player about them depending on what their character could know or perceive. The monster is coming too fast, from their blind side, without making noise? I ask for a roll without telling them what it is for. Are their PCs as established quick enough to read and react to the attack? I describe it, state the stakes and let them take another course of action instead of rolling if they want.<br/><br/>*Above I made a slight distinction between HP loss and wounds. Watching some players convincingly roleplay wounded characters gave me an idea I still have to test. I'm currently adding to my system a flag-like mechanic where players make a list of character features as their background, personality, flaws, bonds, objectives, etc. They get XP when roleplaying those and those can change, increase or decrease depending on how the setory goes. But that's it, they get no penalties or bonuses when using them, they just get XP at the end of the session when roleplaying and being consequent with those. So, why wounds can't be included in these too? <br/><br/>The idea is that when characters suffer the consequences of an attack, the player can choose to either spend HP to minimize the damage or write down a descriptive wound and roleplay it. I expect it to work mostly because my group has an easier time dealing and negotiating with story-related <i>facts</i> instead of remembering small bits of rules or mechanics that kinda break immersion a bit. It will require testing to see how it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465004/#Comment_465004" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-24T20:48:42+00:00" title="July 24, 2017  8:48PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf" rel="nofollow">AsIf</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>When it comes to the "bland" quality of the classes, this is certainly a throwback to oldschool D&amp;D, in that all of the unique aspects of a character must come from the players' imaginations (since there's nowhere else for them to come from).

In the design I'm currently working on, I'm really torn. I think player-facing moves are an amazing way to present interesting failure/compromise lists, and they're also a handy way of side-stepping 'task difficulty' (which is encoded into the move results, c.f. taking enemy fire in Night Witches).<br/><br/>On the other hand, move-based games start to creak a little once your basic move list hits a dozen or so (especially if they're all relatively common). <br/><br/>By far, my favorite thing about player-facing moves is the flexibility they have in inserting design intent. It's soo concise to add an opinion on whether attacking first, attacking hardest, skillfully, what it costs you to kill, what happens to you emotionally in the aftermath, what happens socially in the aftermath.<br/><br/>The muddy compromise I'm at is context-specific failure options, attached to skills or situation-specific chapters.<br/><br/>What's still gnawing at me is the way that I wouldn't mind moves for some aspects of the game, and generic skills for others. For instance, I'd love to insert a design opinion on what it means to address a noble (or other court), but I can get by without the same level of tweaking in other areas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465039/#Comment_465039" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-25T18:53:11+00:00" title="July 25, 2017  6:53PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/paganini" rel="nofollow">paganini</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Rob, I don't have Dungeon World and I've never played it, so I probably won't be able to help.

I found it useful in PbtA games because it keeps the action focused on what's important and because it gives a certain rythm to the GM's responses to the characters' actions.<br/>I also found it extremely useful for OSR games although I apply those principles and that loop in OSR games way more loosely. But it's great for fail-forward, for describing failures not just as characters mistakes or flaws but as complications, and it's a great framework if you have to improvise out of the boundaries of an adventure you prepared.<br/>This is definitely something worth "saving" of DW and that can be ported to other systems as GM Guidelines or even as a system of rules for Game Mastering.<br/><br/>Moves are the next thing mentioned on the blog - with mixed feelings from Rob.<br/>I believe the number of moves is not too much of an issue if they are with a precise focus (for example you bring out Combat Moves only when there is a tactical combat coming up in the fiction). Even Vincent Baker in AW 2nd edition included more moves than in the 1st edition and I don't recall any criticism for this.<br/>(even from those that criticized other hacks with "too many" moves)<br/>I think moves are a precise design choice. If you use them, players will almost always look for the "right" move for the situation. Which means they will also do part of the GM work of remembering which moves/rules are triggered.<br/>Moves can be very powerful in shaping the game in a certain way: I think they are definitely worth saving and porting if you have a clear idea of what you want to happen at the table. Otherwise a more 'traditional' approach would be more natural. Players just say what they want the characters to do and the GM applys rules.<br/>I know in pbta players don't say which move they use - but it's an illusion. They might not say it but they know clearly what they are going to trigger.<br/><br/>If your design uses moves, yes, having a list of plausible 7-9 complications and tables for inspiration is definitely a plus.<br/>It's not always easy to come up with the best answer to a 7-9 but:<br/>- this is true also for 'traditional' GMing<br/>- you have guidelines and principles to help you there<br/>- you can build lists and tables to help you fire up your imagination<br/>- as AW suggests: take a deep breath and think, before you answer to a roll. You're not bound to just have the right answer always ready<br/>- and last but not least: good enough is good enough. You don't need the best answer all the time.<br/><br/>Narrow results and small modifiers feel like a plus to me, especially when you improvise and don't have the time to "playtest" your own calls. There is a smaller chance of mistakes.<br/>Same goes for not rolling dice and "unbalanced" PCs vs NPCs: it let's you focus on the characters and does not necessarily take away the 'simulation' aspect of the game. It simply brings everything and everyone that is not e PC to a higher level of abstraction (again, easier for improvisation).<br/>Well, so far as much as I also don't love DW (but I do love AW!), I feel these are all components worth saving (assuming the game you want to run follows certain principles that go well with these tools).<br/><br/>If this is not too much of a wall of text, i'd like to address the problematic bits too, in a separate post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465044/#Comment_465044" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-25T20:27:46+00:00" title="July 25, 2017  8:27PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2017 7:59AM by Rob_Alexander.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>This is an interesting question, since AW, both as a game and as a text, avoids most of the complaints in Rob's blog post.

I blame RuneQuest (which was my formative model of what game rules should be like, even though I never actually ran or played it), which modelled PC and NPCs (including the most alien of monsters) with exactly the same parameters \u2014 attributes, derived stats, skills, hit locations. To this day, D&amp;D's way of giving monsters "hit dice" rather than class levels, and (in most editions) not giving them attributes, feels kind of weird and wrong to me.<br/><br/>I'm pretty happy to abstract NPCs, e.g. to assume that characters have average attributes unless specified, and indeed to assume that a generic human adult has the same standard properties as any other. But modelling NPCs completely differently never quite feels right.<br/><br/>I can, of course, overlook some "unrightness" in return for play benefits, e.g. DW's very quick statting and very easy adjudication of NPCs.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>"The damage system somehow always feels \u201csoft\u201d to me \u2014 it feels as if injuries are not injuries, just some vague idea such."

You cannot maybe have someone else mele the game for you but you can take the rules text and add to them art from deviantart or wherever (there is also plenty of old school art in CC now, easy to download).<br/>You can litteraly build your game and put the art you like in it - as long as it is for your table and not for sale. Having love for OSR and playing with houserules as you do, you probably can do it *and enjoy the process*.<br/>And as you can tune the art, you can tune the flavor text, make your own setting (i.e. Warhammer-like) and play within that framework. You would hardly be the first to decise to play DW with an established setting. Just make sure your players are onboard and agree to tune their own responses to be inline with the setting and tone.<br/>I would also suggest to search in google for Jason Cordova of The Gauntlet for inspiration. He ran Death Frost Doom of LOTFP with DW. I am sure it can be inspiring.<br/><br/>Since you are rewriting the game :-) you can tune the harm system and the social part of it. They mentioned already a few PbtA games where you can take inspiration, and Paul_T harm post is a great source of inspiration. The moves framework and the simple scores/modifiers should make the job decently easy and not prone to too many mistakes.<br/><br/>If you are ready to rewrite the game this way, the only problem is reskinning the playbooks and making peace with the number of moves. I think it would be worth the effort: I love when the game designer takes a certain load off my shoulders - I need (or players need) to remember what to apply, but the move does most of the heavy lifting for me.<br/>If this bugs you too much, maybe check out World of Dungeons that if I recall correctly solves everything with a single move framework.<br/><br/>Last note: I mentioned a game of mine earlier on but I will now go to delete that post that seems unwelcome to mods and others. I brought it up because it has a hack of Paul harm system, different and grittier and somehow more OSR-ish approach to fantasy than DW while still being a PbtA, and it felt definitely relevant for this topic.

The plethora of moves you've described as characterizing Dungeon World would annoy me too. I hate games that say "here are the rules, use all of them all the time," and them make it overwhelmingly difficult to remember to apply them all. <br/><br/>I think you could probably do a partly-compressed Otherkind Dice mechanic instead of all those moves. <br/><br/>If the Dungeon World designers were any good at all, I bet there are 3 kinds of moves in the game. <br/><br/>1. Core moves imported from Apocalypse World that are required to make the game go<br/>2. Color-y dungeon-specific moves that they brainstormed together to capture this or that particular element of D&amp;D<br/>3. Actual play moves that they created on the spot in their own playtests, or in response to playtest feedback ("hey, we really wanted a move for this thing, but there wasn't one."<br/><br/>I bet you could reverse engineer those moves into a few general situational categories. You could create a sort of proto-move for each category using Otherkind Dice. Sort of like Ghost/Echo. "Roll when..." "the consequences are..." "the danger is..." and you'd always have the option to customize any particular die roll during actual play by improvising new situational danger dice.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/paganini" rel="nofollow">paganini</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>...yeah. You need to play Sorcerer (with &amp; Sword). <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nSorcerer &amp; Sword was a very big influence on me about a decade ago. It changed the way I thought about gaming on many, many fronts.<br/><br/>I've never run it though, nor raw Sorcerer. I've got the impression that its mechanics have dated \u2014 that there are now ways to get the same effect with an easier learning curve and less chance of missing the point. That fair?<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI'd say that was almost always fair. The design of Sorcerer - the mechanics and the play procedures (I mean, kickers, bangs, R-maps, the "story bullseye," etc.) - I think will never become obsolete. But the rules text is hideously confusingly written. <br/><br/>I pegged it for you for a couple of reasons, though. Mechanically, all rolls are opposed, which was one of your complaints about DW ("GM never rolls dice"), and it supplies you a difficulty ladder in case you need one, while at the same time encouraging you to never actually use it. It also has all the uncomfortable weird horror stuff in spades. <br/><br/>- N                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465055/#Comment_465055" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-26T02:52:10+00:00" title="July 26, 2017  2:52AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeon World is *modern* D&amp;D\u2014what Eero sometimes refers to in his threads about D&amp;D as "Paladins and Princesses"\u2014done extremely, extremely well.

The Bard starts with 4 and as they progress to level 10 will gain 9 more from a set of 20. The Cleric similar starts with 5 and progresses to 9 from 21. The hireling rules add 1 main move (p35) and at least one move for each of the 7 hireling types.<br/><br/>That not necessarily a huge amount of complexity, compared to e.g. BW or Pathfinder. But the way its split into discrete small chunks with unique triggers makes it seem like a quite lot to me.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465079/#Comment_465079" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-26T23:31:02+00:00" title="July 26, 2017 11:31PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playbook moves are the individual players' jobs to keep track of, not the DMs. I've run DW for 10 year olds who had no trouble with the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465080/#Comment_465080" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-26T23:59:58+00:00" title="July 26, 2017 11:59PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I would think of it the same way:<br/><br/>8 Basic Moves, which everyone needs to be aware (or at least the GM). These are an "intellectual load", in the sense that we have to know them and be aware of them as we play. If we "forget them" at any point, we're arguably "playing the game wrong".<br/><br/>(Although many people like to "collapse back" to Defy Danger as a default when a move is forgotten or doesn't fit, as per WoD - it's a safe fallback in those situations, without drastically changing the game.)<br/><br/>These might be compared to D&amp;D's:<br/><br/>* Perception/Hearing/Surprise<br/>* Roll for Initiative<br/>* Roll to Hit<br/>* Roll for Damage<br/>* Ability Checks<br/>* Skill Checks<br/>* Saving Throws<br/>* Stealth/Hiding/Climbing/Thief Skills<br/><br/>...or something along those lines. (I'm not really thinking this list through - I'm sure a better or more definitive list could be made.)<br/><br/>Playbook moves and character moves and so forth only need to be referenced by the players in actual play - there's no need to remember these. As Deliverator says, the players can choose to bring them in, or not.<br/><br/><i>These might be like D&amp;D's spells or feats.</i><br/><br/>The "Special Moves" are 13 in number:<br/><br/>* Last Breath<br/>* Encumbrance<br/>* Make Camp<br/>* Take Watch<br/>* Undertake a Perilous Journey<br/>* End of Session<br/>* Level Up<br/>* Carouse<br/>* Supply<br/>* Recover<br/>* Recruit<br/>* Outstanding Warrants<br/>* Bolster<br/><br/>Of these, it seems to me that relatively few need to be remembered or used, however.<br/><br/>Last Breath and Encumbrance seem fairly fundamental to play - at the very least, you need to be aware of them. They don't need to be memorized, however; it's OK to look them up when necessary. Being aware of them is key, however.<br/><br/>End of Session and Level Up are not rules you need to be aware of in play at all, since they are basically "book-keeping" rules, and don't need to be referenced or acknowledged during play itself.<br/><br/>That leaves us with:<br/><br/>Travel<br/>* Undertake a Perilous Journey<br/>* Make Camp<br/>* Take Watch<br/><br/>Visit a Town<br/>* Carouse<br/>* Supply<br/>* Recruit<br/>* Outstanding Warrants<br/><br/>Downtime<br/>* Recover<br/>* Bolster<br/><br/>These are fairly similar to D&amp;D's rest, healing, spending gold/XP, and wilderness travel rules, on one hand (Recover, Make Camp, etc) and D&amp;D's random tables, on the other (Undertake a Perilous Journey, Outstanding Warrants, etc). (However, arguably far simpler, by virtue of being much less detailed.)<br/><br/>I think you could play very effectively with just:<br/><br/>Travel<br/>* Undertake a Perilous Journey<br/>* Make Camp<br/>* Take Watch<br/><br/>Visit a Town<br/>* Carouse<br/>* Recruit<br/>* Outstanding Warrants<br/><br/>Downtime<br/>* Recover<br/><br/>Put those on a piece of paper, to refer to, as essentially three "sets" of rules, and you should be good to go. One set of things for travel, one for doing "in town" activities, and a rule for recovering. Don't look at them or think about them unless that stuff comes up, and it's effectively like three more "triggers" to think of.<br/><br/>That seems fairly spare compared to... well, most/many RPGs in the "D&amp;D" vein.<br/><br/>Does that sound right to anyone? At least that's how I would approach it if I were to play.<br/><br/>You could also ignore all of the "Special Moves" except for Last Breath, Level Up, Encumbrance, and Recover. That would make a very "spare" but effective game of DW (just with less mechanical focus on travel or "town activities" - I suspect most DW games don't involve the hiring of henchmen, for instance, and only a fraction have the PCs throw a party or return to a place where they caused trouble. You'd be able to handle those occasions just fine with the MC's Principles and Moves when they do come up.)<br/><br/>I almost wonder if the presentation of the rules all in one place makes it seem more daunting than something like D&amp;D's version, where we have a Chapter in a Big Book for each activity (a la "Chapter 7: Overland Travel", with its own rules and tables to roll on).<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm just thinking out loud, because I'm equally surprised by the idea that someone (at least an experienced gamer - a single chapter in the BW book will have far more rules than this!) might find this overwhelming. I'm open to the idea, of course - I just find it surprising.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465085/#Comment_465085" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-27T02:19:58+00:00" title="July 27, 2017  2:19AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" rel="nofollow">DiscoSoup</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>You know, I actually think that Dungeon World is superior to Apocalypse World, and that virtually all other hacks are superior to Dungeon World.

It seems to me it would take an incredible amount of work to learn and apply the rules (which is too bad, because otherwise it seems like it would be great to play).<br/><br/>One key thing, I think, is that almost everything outside the Basic Moves is, really, optional. If you "forget" or decide not to use Carouse or Bolster, chances are no one will even notice - the game certainly won't suffer for it.<br/><br/>And, of course, you don't need to know any of the rules.

And that's it, no rules nor "moves". <br/><br/>Except that being an experienced GM you're used to a line of logic that fits both a certain game experience and fictional sub-genre. Maybe you like everything to feel and react more like something that could be historically accurate, except that there is magic in the world. Maybe you are expecting things to develop like if it were the Odyssey, Tolkien or a Monty Python movie. If you have effectively taken away the rules what you've got is a list of facts about how are things supposed to happen.<br/><br/>What rules like Moves do is define a list of facts to fit a genre or sub-genre. This is something that other games either define by using mechanics that make the facts happen as a byproduct, leave open for the players to bring their own tastes in fiction or mention somewhere else as game advice instead of making them hard-coded rules. <br/><br/>If you've got tons of GMing experience behind you, most probably by now you have interiorized your own list of facts, same as your group. You're all probably familiar with them enough to be able to tell when something on the list has changed or if the list has increased or decreased, even if they can't put their finger on what's exactly different. And if you're comfortable with these facts you will certainly find troublesome to change or revise them.<br/><br/>Among the facts you've got in your list there are the thousands of ways you've got deal with a miss, a success and a success with some ugly twist. What I feel as slightly odd in all PbtA games is that the moves tell you how to handle those situations... something you already know!. So then your brain tells you "frag, I'd have to rewrite all the facts in the book to play this game!", which of course feels overwhelming.<br/><br/>However there's nothing as such. You can perfectly read the moves, adapt a bit your fact book and GM as you've always done without looking at them a second time. You just have to identify if this or that fact is either an interesting miss, a success or a success with a twist, something you can do on a case by case basis.<br/><br/>Yet this is something I only came to realize after reading a lot of AW hacks, because for some people like me, it felt like AW originally explained it quite poorly. What was happening was that there were a lot of new concepts there, enough to make the game look at first sight as something totally unfamiliar and counterintuitive, while it was actually the opposite, an incredible way to take away things that were actually detrimental to the game experience in general.<br/><br/>So, this is probably one of the reasons there are so many PbtA games and that they keep coming. So many people have different "genre facts" books out there that no single game fits the bill and creating one to fit yours is just a matter of changing the moves until they reflect how things should go by your book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465107/#Comment_465107" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-27T20:59:11+00:00" title="July 27, 2017  8:59PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2017 9:02PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's notable that AW (and therefore PbtA) was developed from Otherkind dice, not the other way around. <br/><br/>It seemed very limiting to me, at first, compared to the flexibility and open-ended creativity, scalability (and so forth) of Otherkind dice. <br/><br/>However, codifying specific moves does a lot for the game. I still love Otherkind dice, and use that technique in design (sometimes in different/hidden ways, like in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20513/thus-began-the-adventures-of-eowyn" rel="nofollow">Eowyn's Adventures</a>), but the PbtA concept creates a very different style of play which is incredibly effective at doing things "pure" Otherkind dice cannot do.<br/><br/>As WarriorMonk says, one of the things move lists (for example) do is help establish expectations about genre and tone - a very useful thing, indeed. Does the game exist in a world where understanding and manipulating people is easy? Or are people opaque monoliths, unmovable and always aware of their own choices and destiny? Is violence dangerous, or emotionally fraught? Those are the kinds of interesting statements good PbtA game designs make, in my opinion. (And why I find DW somewhat uninteresting; its moves do that far less - I think, by design - than some of the other games. Compare AW, Monsterhearts, and Night Witches, and you'll instantly see what I mean.)<br/><br/>If Otherkind dice is a box full of bricks, PbtA games are sets of finely-crafted Lego pieces - less flexible, but shinier, more developed, and more refined.<br/><br/>WarriorMonk,<br/><br/>I think your points there might be obscured by the vague language you are using to talk about them (e.g. "facts"). Could you use an example or two to show what you mean?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465108/#Comment_465108" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-27T22:06:07+00:00" title="July 27, 2017 10:06PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For example these are few random D&amp;D 5e "facts" I play with. Please, don't read me wrong, I'm only saying that these are "facts" for me and my group as in "our group accepts these as something that will normally happen in our game as they fit our creative agenda"; these are not "universal" facts, these are meant to be "facts" in our shared world only.<br/><br/>-Encumbrance matters, you can't carry all you want.<br/>-Whoever walks away carelessly from an enemy gets attacked.<br/>-If it's related to your species, class, skills or background you must know something about it. At least you know what this thing isn't.<br/>-Violence is always a viable option.<br/>-Combat isn't necessarily lethal. Bad luck and bad choices are.<br/><br/>I'm trying to stick here to facts that come from our interpretation of the rules and game mechanics, though there are more that have been ported from other games and even from interpretations from other groups of players. Some of these may be harder to change than others. For example we used to play with the fact:<br/><br/>-Despite being a skilled adventurer you can still fail at things and look like an idiot.<br/><br/>But after reading DW and other stuff we changed it to:<br/><br/>-Despite being a skilled adventurer enemies reactions an events can turn out to be unexpected.<br/><br/>I still translate some dice rolls and players choices into slapstick comedy when players are up to it, though it's rare. As a general rule now I always try to narrate not how the PC fails but how opponents suddenly do unexpected things instead or how unexpected events happen on the last moment to ruin what would otherwise be an excellent performance. <br/><br/>Hope it's a bit more clear now?

I'm starting to think this is already how every group of players work. I mean, we do adopt rules that already have lots of "facts" ingrained, but then the group brings their own viewpoint of the genre and throws their own "facts" into the mix. The rules, the GM or the social contract decide which stick and which don't. And then the group has established their own list of facts. <br/><br/>While probably only 1/3 of them are actually written down in the rulebooks, the rest are stored in the group's memory, internalized, which ends up being better than the book actually. I mean, that's why memorizing a detailed set of moves seems like too much work: you already know how to deal with most of this stuff but have other wordings for them in your mind and relate them to different procedures, with different feelings attached and possibly a different handling of the setting.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is why "freeform" works for some groups: they have internalized their "facts" more than the mechanic procedures so they can skip these and easily agree on outcomes even without rolling the dice.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it this possibly has to do something with the way I'm currently thinking of my own game designs. I'm trying to go for rules that are a bit more about establishing interesting facts than introducing mechanics that create those facts as a subproduct. But on the way I'm skipping skill descriptions as, on one hand, our group has already internalized those and on the other, I'm going for an anime vibe where there's barely any limit to what a skill can actually accomplish as long as the player can come up with something interesting -even if it's exagerated (like using acrobatics to swing up around a huge opponent's arm to end up kicking his face, for example)<br/><br/>I'd say that basically, if you were to simplify D&amp;D down to a list of "facts"... you would get DW or some OSR PbtA game more or less. <img alt=":lol:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":lol:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
