The players was me (Operations, i.e. GM) and three friends of mine, all passionate boardgamers with a past of unsatisfying (in their words) roleplaying, mostly done with various D&amp;D incarnations. None of them was well versed in spy-themed fiction, and that was my mistake: I still can't believe I was in a room in which I was the only one that watched the Bourne series, or the last Bond movies, or Alias, or 24. My friends seemed never have heard of them. We dabbled around for definitely too much time with the planning phase, never coming up with a real plan. It was mostly "what if we average guys was here, in this situation between Syriana and Mission Impossible". In the end, they said that they were not used to take active decisions in a role-playing game: for them, RPGing was all reactions to the GM. This thing I brought was different.<br/><br/>I still think that WoM is a good game, but you need the right people. And I agree that it's not very tight: we had too much overlappings of Areas of Expertise, and to me this was not good, but the text never mentions this as a potential problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179728/#Comment_179728" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T22:51:32+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 10:51PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoyed it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179734/#Comment_179734" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T05:05:50+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  5:05AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In what way, John?<br/><br/>(Thank you for all the other comments.

Having the highest stat in an area doesn't just make you good in it but lets you do something special no one else can do underlining your awesomeness. I love the time element.

This problem is really one where the players should work it out.  Being the Saturn expert is useless in the mission side of things, so the only value would be in buying the second level to make you the leader.  This is something that the PCs should determine based on who they think would make a good leader.<br/>\n<br/>\nGripe 2: The mission dice bonus given to all non-Saturn players is only mentioned in the recap, not the main text.  This actually plays to why someone would buy more than 2 points of Saturn, but not why more than one player would buy that second Saturn die...<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, I liked the idea very much and the price for the PDF was reasonable.  Only a few errata I caught.  Presentation is simple, but evocative.  I want to try this game out when next I pull some players together and if we all have a few hours fun with it, it will have justified the expense quite nicely...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179847/#Comment_179847" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T04:50:58+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  4:50AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm under the impression Saturn still has uses during the mission, albeit it's a little harder to see situations to incorporate it than, say, Mars or Pluto. I took Saturn to include any on the hoof planning - for example, the mission is complicated by extra security at the landing site where the backup mercenaries are expected to parachute in. Saturn could be used to contact the mercs and arrange a different landing zone at short notice, basically to pull together the necessary logistics and authority to change the plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the rules seem a little unclear on how to resolve PC-vs-PC disputes, especially considering the encouragement of betrayal. What happens if the betrayed figures out what's been happening and tries to shoot the betrayer? I guess it wouldn't be too hard to modify the existing risk outcomes to determine narrator and every point over the opposition knocks out one of their Mission Dice or expertise?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ozbot" title="ozbot"><img alt="ozbot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/nCTCPKSKDL4Z7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ozbot">ozbot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179903/#Comment_179903" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T14:35:08+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  2:35PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been waiting to get my hands on this game for a while, and I'm not disappointed. It just so matches the kind of game I'm looking for. Still, I do think I was expecting more of a complete game. The pdf seems to be describing just as much of a *style* of play and leaves just the bare bones of actually HOW to do it. Still, I definitely want to jump in and try it, especially the "heist" version it hints at at the end. I suspect it will make a great one-shot game for my next game night.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I'm unsure of is the betrayal aspects. Like Adrian, I agree that it's somewhat missing a "endgame" of sorts for the betrayer-- i.e. what happens when the betrayal is exposed? But there's a lot more missing, too. Is "abeyance" the only kind of betrayal? If so, why do all players get dice for betraying others? Is there any other benefit to Trust Dice, because if they are used as Mission Dice, why differentiate? Can a Saturn never be put on abeyance, by definition?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there's nothing really addressing characterization or motivation, etc. in the game. That's not to say that it's deficient-- the game wasn't designed with those things in mind in the first place. The emphasis in making it was to focus on plot, and that's what the game delivers. Still, the author mentions that his influences include Alias, 24, and Femme Nikita, which all have pretty strong characterizations and moments of personal and interpersonal dilemma. There's nothing to say you can't bring these things into WoM, but there's nothing mechanically to support or encourage it either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
