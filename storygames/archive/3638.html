He believes that the traditional approach to roleplaying, mostly focused on increasing the personal power of your character, prevents this from becoming a popular mode of roleplaying. This lack of popularity might potentially keep him from writing his game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am inclined to agree, with reservations. My thinking is that traditional approaches to roleplaying, especially as emphasized by "RPG" video games, teaches that roleplaying is at its core the simulation of a heroic character in a fictional world, defined by statistics, and that the purpose of the game is to increase those statistics. WotC propaganda and authoritative claims from stodgy old D&amp;D grognards reinforce this idea. Since most gamers arrive at the hobby through either RPG video games, WotC advertising or association with D&amp;D grognards, this is the preconception that many players have. Simply sitting one of these gamers down with a game that doesn't operate using this formula, without explaining to them how they work differently and what the object of the game is, can result in nothing but misunderstandings and aversion. I believe there are methods of dealing with this, by destroying the preconceptions of what roleplaying is and what makes it fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome (perhaps rhetorical) questions: Are gamers as single-minded as some claim? Are there ways of consistently generating motivation and fun other than emphasis on increasing character ability? Most importantly, are there methods of generating motivation and fun that mesh with multi-character roleplay?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81806/#Comment_81806" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T14:27:13+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  2:27PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Console encourages having multiple characters for each player.

However, I'd support the hypothesis that <em>player ability</em> needs to increase.  In addition to creating a story, RPGs are still games.  Games need some sort of progression to keep them interesting, and generally speaking what happens next needs to be more significant than what just happened.  Note, however, that doesn't mean that adversity keeps getting ramped up.  It just means that each bit of the game is more important and more rewarding to the players than the bit before it.<br/><br/>We've all played in games where you finish "the important bit" and the rest of the game is just a formality.  Consider the last ten turns of every Risk game ever played -- everybody knows who's going to win.  The value in those last turns are the winning player get to gloat and exult over his victory -- and those ten turns happen pretty quickly.  Contrast with chess, where it can become quite obvious that black is going to win, but not after a prolonged whittling down of white pieces.  The game has a 'surrender' mechanic available for white to end the game and recognize black's victory.  Why?  Because if white 'sticks it out' and plays until checkmate, you get a really boring last ten (or twenty) turns that aren't fun for anybody.<br/><br/>Now, in Risk, the winning player's ability to affect the game keeps increasing.  The losing players' abilities are extinguished, yes, but the balance of power is still shifting.  In chess, you get to a point where the winning player's ability is no longer increasing -- they are not getting any more pieces, obviously, and they are not improving their tactical situation (since they already have a lock on winning).  All that's happening is that the losing player's ability to change the game is dwindling, and that's not that much fun.<br/><br/>Back to the question: consistently generating motivation to play and fun means that there's something in it for the player if they keep playing.  There's a payoff in the next part of the game, either in terms of increased ability to affect the course of the game or some emotional catharsis or resolution.  None of that needs to be explicitly tied to the character-bit.<br/><br/>Now, the simplest transition from "egotistical" play to troupe-centric play would be to replace the character with the faction.  Instead of increasing the character's stats and resources, you increase the faction's stats and resources.  Hit points become members, for instance.  However, I don't think this would really generate a very different play experience, since mechanically nothing has changed.  (I also foresee some real trouble in getting the players to meaningfully interact with each other -- if I play the Theives' Guild and you play the Palace Guard, we can both think of reasons to get them to interact once.  A roleplaying game needs to get them to interact in every other scene or so.)<br/><br/>Another approach is to disengage the players' ability to affect the game from their characters.  A character sheet is just a list of resources that the player can use to affect the game.  You can just have player sheets which list off how the player can interact with the game without character-bits necessarily getting involved.  Universalis may work like this with its coins and such, although I am a bad indie gamer and have not actually read it.<br/><br/>The real trap that underlies a violent reaction against self-serving egotistical play is to try and get the players to act for the "good of the game" or for the "good of the story" without providing them any mechanical support to accomplish that.  If I have to sacrifice my ability to affect and enjoy the game in order to make the story better, I'm not going to do it.  Neither are most players: we'd rather hold out and wait for a better opportunity to make the story better with the resources we have, and do so in a way that doesn't hamper our long-term ability to enjoy ourselves.<br/><br/>The trick in game design is to mechanically reward and mechanically support the "right" decisions that you want to foster.  Dungeoncrawl games do this by investing cool fictional stuff with the ability to interact with the game.  The more cool fictional stuff you have -- magic swords, awesome abilities, arcane spells -- the more you can affect what happens in the game.  The more likely you are to be able to craft an emotional catharsis and payoff that pleases you.  None of which is incompatible with "players control more than one dude."  Any design that wishes to implement that gimmick, though, needs to figure out what the payoff is and how they can make the payoff happen when the players control more than one dude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81866/#Comment_81866" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T18:07:58+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  6:07PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>needs to figure out what the payoff is and how they can make the payoff happen when the players control more than one dude.</blockquote>\nYep. So what payoffs can we list off? I can list:\n<ul>\n<li>Character identification and immersion </li>\n<li>Witnessing the personal power progression of your character</li>\n<li>A competitive win over other players</li>\n<li>First hand experience of an interesting story</li>\n</ul>\nGames may strive for, and achieve, more than one of these. I'm sure there are more, and I'm sure mine could be boiled down and refined. Please feel free to do so! I'm very interested.<br/><br/>In a multi-character game, though, I don't think the first one works. It's very hard to identify with more than one character at a time, at least to the level where you connect well enough to take full enjoyment from the experience. The second one, obviously, would be modified to "witnessing the personal power progression of your faction", if that's what you're playing. The third and fourth would work beautifully, but may be at odds with each other - competitive wins tend to lead to strategic and abstract gaming, while deep storytelling tends to be much more concrete and detailed to be effective.<br/><br/>Can we add to the list? Can we think of other motivators that would work with multi-character games?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Are gamers as single-minded as some claim?

Ignore the first two questions - the first is bogus and the second is forever invalidated by the massive success of Spirit of the Century. Let's focus on motivators for multi-character play, where character identification and personal character power cannot be used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81883/#Comment_81883" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T19:33:08+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  7:33PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I'm not too familiar with Console Legends, so how does it handle this issue?<br/><br/>Are players motivated by the success of their "party"?

The whole GNS/Creative Agenda thing?  Because, pretty much, it's about answering the question of what reason people have for playing a given game.

I recall no particular joy in finding the easy things but in going that extra mile to find everything. We would reduce whole throne rooms in the dungeon to piles of splinters as we took apart everything chair, desk, and pedestal in the room on the chance of finding a secreted item.<br/>At the end of each dungeon module the GM let us read the module to what we had missed.<br/><br/>I think since it was just me and my brother playing PCs that really let this style of play work for us. In later games with different people it didn't work as well. They were not as into that kind of play as we were. Most of them were there for the advancement of their characters but by that time we had changed DMs and the new guy ran things a lot differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82620/#Comment_82620" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-22T19:49:59+00:00" title="July 22, 2007  7:49PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've qouted the bits of Jims stuff that I wanted/could to respond to. my responses are within his in a second layer of block qouting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>I have some questions to pose.<br/><br/>Is it possible to turn a MASSIVE war game into a story?<br/><cite>Posted By: tj333</cite>Not sure about a game but <a href="http://librivox.org/the-history-of-the-peloponnesian-war-by-thucydides/" rel="nofollow">The History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides</a> made for an interesting story to me without centering on anyone person too long or too strongly to distract from it being a story about the war.</blockquote>\nIs it possible to emulate the woes of a squad of men in a Gettysburg reenactment?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tj333</cite>I'm uncertain but I think so.</blockquote>\nIs it possible to like numerous character in a wrestling league for instance, at the same level and not know who to rout for?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tj333</cite>Yes, I've had that experience in a Capes game.</blockquote>\nIs it possible to like all of the Yankees?
