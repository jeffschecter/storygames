                    This is totally not inspired by the political statement thread. At least consciously.<br/>
<br/>
In <i>the Ministry of Rape and Pillage</i>, players take on the role of ministers in a particularly horrible government. The goal is to be as absolutely wicked and tyrannous as possible without getting your back up against the wall by any revolutions or getting convicted for treason by the same machine you help run. It's competitive and midway between a strategy and a roleplaying game. The Ministries are specified by the game such that each has a particular method of wickedness that nevertheless creates problems for all the other Ministries, such that:<br/>
<br/>
1) The Ministry of the Treasury levies <i>taxes</i>, and so the goal of that Minister is to bleed everyone as dry as they'll go. But left unchecked taxes will go back to the people in the form of <i>social spending</i>, and that would be no good, because then people would get roads and healthcare and things like that. So for whatever amount of success the Minister of the Treasurer has in taxes, everyone (including him) has to funnel her share into sinecures, embezzlement, and lavish parties.<br/>
<br/>
2) Similarly, the Ministry of Justice has to scapegoat and persecute various enemies of the state, torture dissidents, and such forth. But whenever they succeed in their glorious quest to expunge (reviled group) from the Homeland, all the ministries must contend with why exactly, even in the absense of the sabateurs of last year, everything sucks horribly. So new scapegoats have to be created.<br/>
<br/>
3) The Ministry of Defense sends out the sons of the Homeland to die subjegating nearby hapless country, which may or may not be harboring this years state enemies. The Minister of Defense can pursue this goal more or less independently of tax revenue, which still has to go into sinecures and Swiss accounts, because it is the policy of the government in question to man its army with poorly-equipped and poorly-paid conscripts to die by the legion. This causes... some ripple effect with which everyone has to deal, I don't know yet.<br/>
<br/>
Other Ministries might be the Ministry of the Interior, which has to destroy the forests and streams of the country as rapaciously as possible (but then everyone has to funnel all the lumber and coal and uranium into expensive superweapons and yacht factories and such); and so on and such forth. Five Ministries, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, you all serve a President who must remain completely blameless at all times, and therefore, all failures of the government that can't be scapegoated at lower levels must be due to the pernicious intent of his traitorous advisors. Everyone has to take the fall for something; hopefully you can impute it to your fellow players.<br/>
<br/>
Also, dastardly acts bring <i>actual</i> enemies of the state out of the woodworks - though maybe the game should more properly imitate the mindset of its subjects by not distinguishing between real and imagined enemies.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, the rising Blame, rising unrest, and diminishing stock of things to plunder provides a natural timer to the game that can only end in the collapse of the government. Whoever escapes with their life, the fattest Swiss account, and the most dastardly reputation wins! This could be light and humorous or very, very dark.<br/>

                            Borrowing an idea from the props thread, maybe having powers-currently-held represented by cards or whatever, players could award themselves medals. Players bid for medals with bureaucratic influence, say, and getting the Medal of Supreme Devotion to the Homeland gives you some control over turn order, say, or the Platinum Medal of Valorous Compassion lets you send an opponent's functionary to a show trial twice in one round instead of just once.                        </div>

                            Ooh, a quick thought about show trials, since I sort of mentioned them offhand and then realized they're very exploitable - they could be roleplayed, but the part of the accused functionary would actually be played <i>by the player who took the action to initiate the show trial</i> - because the accused has been tortured and agrees to argue for his own guilt. I'm not sure which mechanical force would allow the defending player to work for his functionary's innocence, though, or at least recuperation.<br/>
<br/>
Functionaries could be represented by personel forms, perhaps, and have a couple of personality traits that determine their mechanical function in normal gameplay and tell the "accusing player" how to roleplay them.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Aha! Once accused, tortured, and confessing, a functionary's jig is up; there's no way to save him. But the defending player, acting as the prosecution, can try to prove that he did not work alone but was part of a conspiracy. Back-and-forth between the attaking player/accused functionary and defending player/prosecution goes in rounds until the other players (jury) can reach a unanimous conclusion. If they can't resolve it within some set number of rounds the majority rules with the result being declared unanimous anyway.                        </div>
