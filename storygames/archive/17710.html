I'm thinking something like the DC Universe (pre-new52) where you have legacies and a very large shared multiverse. I'd prefer something less on the crunchy side, but a little crunch isn't terrible. I'd love to know your own experiences with a superhero story game campaign, what worked for you and what you would changed if you did it again. I know of the Marvel Heroic, haven't spent much time studying it, but also aware it may not be "the best" system for what I have in mind.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream" title="daniel_ream"><img alt="daniel_ream" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream">daniel_ream</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401107/#Comment_401107" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T15:29:52+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  3:29PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played around with some of the more well-known indie superhero games.  Capes is good mechanically, but the tone and writing style lean heavily towards camp parody of the Silver Age.  I also found the mechanics getting in the way rather more than helping the fiction; that's very much a YMMV issue.<br/><br/>World vs. Hero is excellent if you want to do conventional solo superhero stories.  I don't think it could be hacked to do a group book very well.  It's also pretty heavy on the gamist side as well, but seemed to work better when I tried it out.<br/><br/>With Great Power looks good, but I haven't been able to try it out yet.<br/><br/>All three of these focus very heavily on the moralism and personality of superhero stories, but tend to fall down a bit on the Heroic Myth angle.  There's supposed to be a superhero hack of HeroQuest2 coming Real Soon Now, and I think that would be a really good system for it.<br/><br/>I've never run an ongoing campaign with these, only one-shots or 2-4 sessions mini-series.  There's nothing about them that would prevent it, I don't think.<br/><br/>I really, really wanted to like MHR, but again found the rules complexity getting in the way.  I've had a blast with the old card-based Marvel SAGA rpg, but it's impossible to find any more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401109/#Comment_401109" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T15:45:21+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  3:45PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really wanna try World vs. Hero.

I also like the idea of having "mega-crossover events" as a part of the system (which I believe Marvel Heroic does?). Not too interested in PvP, more team based or scene based (solo heroes each on their own separate missions that crossover and come together narratively). I like the archetypes of classical superheroes (The Detective, The Myth, The Science Hero, The Alien, etc). I wish there was an Apocalypse World superhero hack because I feel like that might scratch my itch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401122/#Comment_401122" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T18:34:13+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  6:34PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sage has this game called Powers For Good that's pretty fun, but it's been overshadowed something serious by Dungeon World.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/huckabees" title="huckabees"><img alt="huckabees" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/huckabees">huckabees</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401123/#Comment_401123" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T18:44:01+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  6:44PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2012 6:44PM by huckabees.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sage has this game called Powers For Good that's pretty fun, but it's been overshadowed something serious by Dungeon World.</blockquote>\nWhere does one find Powers for Good.

Its approach to superpower action is much more abstract than MHR's, and it does a great job of making (for example) a fight between a ridiculously powerful character like Superman and anyone else into something that isn't a totally boring, foregone conclusion. Considering how wildly power levels vary just among the Justice League, having a system that makes every character viable and fun to play even in the same scene sounds ideal for a DCU game to me, but YMMV.<br/><br/>Smallville also has a stronger focus on interpersonal relationships, though, so it might not be appropriate if you don't want your game to embrace that aspect of comics. It nails "superheroes talking and wondering what to do," not so much "big panel-by-panel superhero fight scene action." And character creation's kind of an involved process: everyone collaborates on building a relationship map and there's a kind of lifepath system to follow that can make it difficult to make the kind of superhero you want. (In this respect, MHR <i>kicks serious ass</i>: I have never had a better, easier, more satisfying superhero character creation experience than the one I had with MHR.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil" title="m_busuttil"><img alt="m_busuttil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil">m_busuttil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401142/#Comment_401142" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-18T02:26:42+00:00" title="December 18, 2012  2:26AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Superhero Apocalypse World sounds like the greatest idea ever... what are the rules for adapting AW again?<br/><br/>I feel obliged to mention that there's an Our Last Best Hope superhero mission generator on its way in the companion book (I wrote it), but it's not designed for what you want - it's much better for big one-off missions.

Smallville would also work.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401166/#Comment_401166" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-18T09:50:46+00:00" title="December 18, 2012  9:50AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smallville is all about PvP emotional interplay so you're players should be wanting to fuck with each other.  It's cool, I dig it but I don't really see me using it again.  That is, Monsterhearts of all things has pretty much replaced it and does the emotional interplay without the rules overhead. The characters are 'horror' themed but they're super-hero types nonetheless, simply with a different implied game agenda.<br/><br/>Marvel Heroic is a great, great action game. A big recommend on this.  A lot of folks say this game has rules complexity but I don't see it. There's a few bulletpoints of "here's how you manipulate the dice..." but once you get those down (and finding cheat sheets on the web is easy), the game is super smooth and fast. I did one read-through of the rules and was ready to run; I taught the game to 20 people over the course at a con and it felt like most people picked it up pretty damn fast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401168/#Comment_401168" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-18T10:35:53+00:00" title="December 18, 2012 10:35AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Big recommend on Marvel Heroic - <b>really </b>good for canon characters (the XP system is really neat for this), and a genuine narrative-friendly conflict system that leads to some awesome scenery-chewing. Can also recommend Strange FATE - played in an Avengers game at a con this year using this system and it handled the power disparity well. There was something really neat in the FATE system in Hawkeye and Black Widow stacking up Aspects for Thor to finally take down the abomination, while Iron Man and Cap duked it out with the rest of the supervillain team, which worked well with power scaling that can sometimes be a problem, particularly if you're using canon characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401175/#Comment_401175" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-18T11:51:15+00:00" title="December 18, 2012 11:51AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can do Smallville without much in the way of PVP, but it does mean you'll be throwing more situations/badguys at the characters more actively.
