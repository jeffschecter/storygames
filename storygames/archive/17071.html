I thought an interesting way to start was to use the "love letters" idea from AW, one centered around each possible class (including the new Druid from the Kickstarter campaign), and I could really use some help.<br/><br/>I looked through the example letters in AW and most of them seem to follow the pattern of "[Situation] [Request for detail from player] [ROLL+STAT] [Choose]"<br/><br/>I've got some basic ideas for each class: the Fighter's been developing a vampire-effective fight style, the Wizard's been experimenting with vampire blood, the Thief managed to pull off (or be scammed in) a big heist with the MacGuffin being something vampire-related, etc.<br/><br/>It's the actual composition on the letters that's throwing me. I'm trying to keep in mind John Harper's advice (<a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/10/apocalypse-world-crossing-line.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/10/apocalypse-world-crossing-line.html</a>) and not cross the line with regards to world-building, but I could definitely use some help/advice. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Following the pattern, I'm thinking they'd look something like:<br/><br/>Dear Fighter,<br/><br/>We hear you've been working on a new fighting style that's particularly effective against vamps and you've got a couple of followers interested in learning more. Tell us a little about it.<br/><br/>Then, roll+WIS: On a 10+ choose 2, on a 7-9 choose 1:<br/><br/>* Your style's weakness isn't currently known by one of the nearby clans.<br/>* Your students are completely loyal.<br/>* The child of one of the major vamps your technique took out isn't currently seeking revenge.<br/><br/>Xoxo,<br/>Your GM<br/><br/>The idea is to have lots of vampire connected hooks from the beginning, even if they won't immediately make themselves known.<br/><br/>My question is: would having 4-5 characters with this much background from the start be the antithesis of AW/DW's "play to find out"? <br/><br/>Also - any ideas or help coming up with good hooks would be greatly appreciated! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>-d-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387655/#Comment_387655" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T08:45:29+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  8:45AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the assumption is that all the players know each other already and a vampire has claimed one of their mutual companions.

That way you're group building [only] an NPC while soliciting group buy-in to hunting down the vampire that killed/abducted/turned him/her.  You're also setting them up for fleshing out their bonds with each other and building the world out from around this central conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387656/#Comment_387656" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T08:55:01+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  8:55AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that, Marshall! There could still be some moves for preparation. Fighter, choose two items from this list you've been able to get your hands on, you're pretty sure they'll have some effect on the camp: (concentrated holy water, black garlic from the nightfields, a stake of living wood, etc.)<br/><br/>I could see each love letter having three brief parts:<br/><br/>A quick bit about your friend who was abducted and his abductor, letting each player establish a detail about that.<br/><br/>A quick bit about the larger vampire society/problem, letting each player establish a detail about that.<br/><br/>A quick bit about how you've prepared for this.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>John's post is absolutely the case, but loveletter moves aren't quite like other moves. Since they're setup things you can allow them the cloud that boundary between player and GM a little, kind of like how GM questions can give the players a lot of control over the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387662/#Comment_387662" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T09:27:58+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  9:27AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I've used to varying impact is a set of extra bond questions that speak to the adventure.
