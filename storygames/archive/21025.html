With 6, I might have forgotten player 1's turn by the time we finished player 6's turn.<br/><br/>That'd be my only concern, though -- I don't remember anything about the rules that'd make it bad for 6, and the set-up phase might actually be a ton of fun with a bigger group!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461520/#Comment_461520" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-29T21:41:32+00:00" title="March 29, 2017  9:41PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with David on all accounts (in fact, 3 is my favorite number of players for <i>Shock</i>, though I've had satisfying games with 4).<br/><br/>There are three courses of action I can recommend:<br/><br/>1. Don't play as a Protagonist or Antagonist yourself - just facilitate the game. This may sound like a bummer, but it's also a chance to reference the book and learn the details of the game under reduced pressure. Just make it clear that you're socially hosting the game, but you aren't the "GM" or anything. Additionally, you can participate in play (and roll dice) as an Audience member. This way, you'd be playing 5 stories, with 5 Protagonists and their Antagonists (you'll have to explicitly try and use up all the Antagonists' tokens in two rounds of play, or you'll probably run out of time if you're playing in your usual 2-3 hour slot).<br/><br/>2. Contrary to the game's rules as written, have three players be Protagonists and three players be their Antagonists - with no change of role during play except to/from Audience. No other rules hacks required! This way, you'd be playing 3 stories, with 3 Protagonists and their respective Antagonists.<br/><br/>3. Minimally playtested, but I sort of did it once, when playing with children. Team up in groups of two players and create three couples or pairs of main characters who will each be through a story together because being together is part of who they are! Of course that requires careful thinking about who these pairs might be, but you could even design a Shock around that. Share a single Protagonist sheet which applies to the two characters as a whole! Should ease the workload of playing Antagonist as you share it with your partner. This way, you'd be playing 3 stories, with 3 Protagonist couplets (6 characters total) and their Antagonists.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461521/#Comment_461521" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-29T21:42:22+00:00" title="March 29, 2017  9:42PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about semi-splitting them?

But seriously what Caroline said. <br/><br/>I teach a science for elementary science teachers. We play Shock over the course of 2-3 days to explore the moral space around a science issue. <br/><br/>Example from one class:<br/><br/>We had a single Shock. You are on the last ships leaving for Mars. <br/><br/>Each group of 3-4 then created their own set of 'Tags and Issues and other Shocky stuff. <br/><br/>In this game one group was already on Mars, one was left behind on Earth, and all the others were scattered on different ships (you could move to different ships if you wanted).<br/><br/>My main job was to run around to each table and cheer everyone one. Push things when needed and help untangle the dice mechanics.  <br/><br/>I've run games like this for both classes every semester. <br/><br/>We've also done mixed Shocks but around a central theme. The single Shock across multiple communities is my favorite.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
