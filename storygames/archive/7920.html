Ford style ones, not later canonical ones) adventures and simply using them, openly, as the situation starter, a bit like Malcolm Craig had suggested doing with an Open-style Cold City game. <br/><br/>Basically, the players are fully aware of the secrets and so on, but the characters are not. Part of what the players do is then try to mix things up so those cross-purposes and secrets clash.<br/><br/>Someone else had also suggested the Triangle campaign, since it seems to be a sort of intergalactic neutral zone.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was thinking of doing that because the players can then start from pre-made characters and situation, then the GM acts more like a simple enablor/mediator rather than the more ful-scale GM of Yore. I also wanted to do these as one-shots rather than a campaign, so speeding up play is a big deal for what I had in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/morgue" title="morgue"><img alt="morgue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/morgue">morgue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175492/#Comment_175492" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-19T17:32:37+00:00" title="October 19, 2008  5:32PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a great plan.

(Okay, with one or two exceptions if you read between the lines.) PTA on the other hand gives all agendas, all the time.

Heck, even if the module has "events which <b>must</b> occur", you can, as a group, look at that more like the direction things might have gone until the players ( and sometimes their characters) started mucking with it.<br/><br/>Alternately, I suppose you might decide to shove things in that direction anyway; a sort of group agreement to follow the rails to a point, before veering off.<br/><br/>If it does work out, though, you're right, it would be a good way to re-purpose those old modules. I actually think it might work better for non-site modules like the trek stuff, or even some of the old pulpy stuff.<br/><br/>Hell, might even work for some of those old WW modules. Just let the players pick amongst the NPCs, rather than having them try to wedge in appropriate characters with limited info. Besides, who wouldn't want to play vampire-Al Capone?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
