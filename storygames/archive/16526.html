CF is a fast fun little system that feels a little like a FATE/Agon mash-up (because you have Aspects and abilities measured in step-dice) and is supposed to be used for medieval historical fiction. The rules presume a European Middle Ages setting, but there's not a whole lot in the rules themselves that supports the "medievalness" of any given game. If you squint, the "mentors" you pick in character creation to train you in your abilities and grant you your tools look a little like a pattern of feudal ties and obligations, but they're really not intended to carry that weight. Other than that, there's a brief, high-level potted history of the period, and a list of suggestions for the types of situations medieval characters might find themselves in (Battles! Quests! Intrigue! Sieges! Crusades!) as well as a very nice but really generic set of procedures for setting up an adventure (define the situation, establish the setting, create a relationship map, go!)<br/><br/>I'm not complaining, mind you; I'm just telling you what the game gives you to work with. But how do you run actually run a crusade using <i>Chronica Feudalis</i>? Clearly, you have to do your homework, and there are no obvious rules for chaining immediate success or failure into larger consequences--i.e., how does me winning a sword fight against a Turk with a scimitar on the battlefield of Dorylaeum affect my side's chances of winning the battle? Should it? If so, then how do I judge? If not, and what I do doesn't matter to the larger question, then why am I risking my neck at all? The obvious answer from the perspective of CF's rules is that you win the larger fight when you take out your opposition, but that sort of begs the question, because identifying exactly what or who is the opposition that needs to be taken out is the entire issue. Alternately, it could be that the PCs' actions are consequential only in their own context, and the larger tapestry of events will unfold only as a backdrop to the PCs' efforts, their medium but not their outcome. However, that may be a little unsatisfying as a method if the players want their characters to matter and they feel they are being relegated to an "eyewitness to history" position. So I want to hold out the possibility that what the PCs do can affect the course of the First Crusade, for good or ill. At the same time, it should be the case that the act of "going on crusade" should be able to powerfully affect the characters.<br/><br/>No matter! These cavils are mere pettifoggery; I'm a <i>game master</i>, dammit--figuring out when the bad guys give is my <i>job</i>; I can wave a hand with the best of them. And I have wanted to run a campaign based on the First Crusade (where a bunch of 11th century European noblemen heed the Pope's instructions to assemble at Constantinople and, despite their bitter rivalries and increasingly desperate circumstances, fight their way to Jerusalem, creating new kingdoms and having high-stakes adventures along the way) since I read Steven Runciman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Crusades-Vol-Foundations-Jerusalem/dp/052134770X" rel="nofollow">History of the Crusades</a> in high school. And I've used CF to run a First Crusade one-shot several times. For this one-shot, the PCs are Crusader princes trying to conquer the Syrian city of Antioch en route to Jerusalem. It's always been a satisfying game, with martial valor, calculating self-interest, and pious zealotry mixed together in good measure, but a single episode--however climactic--doesn't do justice to the grand sweep of an entire pilgrimage in arms.<br/><br/>So after I got them to try out CF in the form of the Antioch one-shot, my local game group agreed to participate in a Crusades mini-campaign. It's a nice group: two married couples plus an undergrad from the local university (although the undergrad has graduated has gotten himself a job across the country and won't be around much longer). They're not super-serious role-players, or at least not all of them are, so this campaign seems to be a little bit of a change of pace for them from their somewhat more gonzo or at least slightly silly style. Immersionists they are not, but they are at least in this instance concerned with their characters as fictional characters, with the Crusade as the defining crucible of their lives and identities.<br/><br/>Our first session was character generation; we talked about just how serious we were willing the game should be (pogroms? no? okay) and other ground rules, settling upon what I think is a PG-13 contract. Only four players were at the first session: Clark and Amanda, plus Paul and Carrie. Clark created a skeptical monk looking for something to re-establish his faith; Amanda, a disgraced young noblewoman forced into a nunnery; Paul, a mercenary bandit captain who hopes to redeem his knighthood by taking the cross; Carrie, a Joan of Arc-type female knight who has set out on crusade to protect the poor. At the start of the next session, Matt showed up and created Khalid, a Muslim convert to Christianity who was also a surgeon and prosthesis-maker.<br/><br/>In addition to the character creation session, we\u2019ve played three times. The first session covered Clermont to Constantinople (that is, hearing the call to the Crusade, preparing for the journey, and traveling from southern France, across the top of the Italian boot, down the Adriatic coast of the Balkan peninsula into the Byzantine Empire, and then across the Greek peninsula to Constantinople. The action consisted mainly of dealing with the rigors of the journey; the highlight was when the marching column came under attack by Slavic bandits and the more war-like PCs helped their leader Count Raymond fight a delaying action in a mountain pass while the others tried to get across the river into Byzantine territory and relative safety. There was a meeting with the Emperor in which oaths of loyalty were reluctantly sworn, and some trouble with the Imperial police as well as bad blood with a fellow crusader.<br/><br/>A couple of things emerged from that first session. First of all, training skills is fun.  I let players roll to advance the skill that they were trying to train at intervals during the session, rather than at the end of a session, as the rules say. Because of the nature of the adventure, in which lots of travel time can be compressed into a single roll to Fend its dangers and hardships, it just made sense to allow training when a particular stage of the journey was completed. One thing that I will do in the future is allow players to train more than one skill at a time so long as a mentor is available for any skill beyond the first. This will encourage them to interact with NPCs, using this rule:\n<blockquote> Characters may identify mentors and select skills to train during the journey. Selecting a mentor requires a skill roll of some kind to establish the relationship. On a success, the mentor will train the character at a d8 level; on a double success, d10 level; triple, d12. The leaders of the army are certainly available as mentors, at least in the sense of distant role-models.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378632/#Comment_378632" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T08:50:42+00:00" title="May 16, 2012  8:50AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Additionally, I settled upon a house rule for \u201cenduring\u201d Aspects. Conflicts work such that you roll a dice pool in which the size of any given die is determined by the relevant skill, tool, or aspect you\u2019re building in to the pool. So if you\u2019re trying to give chase to a fleeing bandit, you might roll your d8 Ride skill, your d12 Warhorse, and your d6 Thrill of the Hunt aspect, counting each die that exceeds a target number as a single success. Before you roll, however, the GM can make you \u201cendure\u201d a complicating Aspect if its size (measured in die size) is greater than or equal to one of your dice, in which case (in the RAW) it eliminates that die. What I do instead is make you step down one of your dice based on the size of the complication you\u2019re enduring: a d6 complication steps down one of your dice one step, a d8 two steps, a 10 three steps, and a d12 four steps. So if you\u2019re rolling a d10 and I have a d8 complication that I can invoke, I pay you 1 Ardor (i.e., Fate point) as per the rules and step your d10 down two steps to a d6.<br/><br/>I also realized that I\u2019m used to games that do a lot of my prep for me. I wanted to use the mentors that the PCs had created as NPCs on the crusade, and that worked out okay, although some mentors were more relevant than others and they didn\u2019t really drive play the way that a more fully-fleshed out relationship map would have. But it worked: the PCs were ready to hate the bandit mentor who was up to no good and making trouble for them with the Imperials, for example. At this point, I do have a small stable of NPCs that I can use to drive character action and drama, and the PCs have begun to develop at least basic attitudes towards some of them. \u201cOh, that guy! We <i>hate</i> him!\u201d<br/><br/>The second session started off in Constantinople. with Khalid the Surgeon being brought in on a tricky case involving Princess Anna, the Emperor\u2019s daughter. Thanks to wifi and the Internet, I was able to have Princess Anna present with the symptoms of anemia, which Khalid rolled well enough to diagnose and treat with a regimen of bloody rare steaks. It was interesting how that played out, since Matt didn\u2019t have the expertise his character did, but once Clark figured it out, he made the suggestion that iron-rich food would do the trick, and that was taken up by Matt as his character\u2019s response to the problem. The game mechanical outcome was the Emperor\u2019s favor as a free tag for Khalid. The action then moved across the Bosporus into Anatolia, where the PCs\u2019 Provencal contingent met up with crusaders from all over Europe laying siege to the city of Nicaea, in northern Anatolia, now garrisoned by the Turks. The PCs helped repel a relieving army led by Kilij Arslan, a Turkish emir, and Khalid used his wood-working skills to build a trebuchet to help storm the city. Clark\u2019s monk Matthias, sickened by the impending bloodshed, used the connections he\u2019d formed with the Byzantine Greeks to sneak into the city across the lake patrolled by a Byzantine flotilla and convince the garrison to surrender.<br/><br/>Something like that happened in real life, and that\u2019s when I resolved that I would do what I could to put the PCs in a position where their actions, if successful, would cause history to go on its appointed path. This can be called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashman_(novel)" rel="nofollow">Flashman</a>  approach to historical gaming. So next session, when the PCs fought the battle of Dorylaeum, where the crusaders were ambushed by Turkish archers, I set things up so that Carrie\u2019s PC Lady Gigi, if successful, would lead a contingent through some concealing hills around to the Turkish flank and rout them, which she did, thanks to a chain of passed free tags from her fellow PCs.<br/><br/>But the game isn\u2019t all historical highlights! Most of the action is the PCs dealing with life on a crusade. Amanda\u2019s sister Galliana, having failed her Fend roll during the march south from Nicaea, was starving; we decided that her stern preceptress was forcing her to fast. The minstrel who\u2019d dishonored her, also present on the crusade, sidled up to her and smarmily invited her to his tent for a feast. Plying her with roast chicken, he attempted to seduce her; Amanda was willing that this be subject to the roll of the dice (\u201cI guess I can\u2019t just pay you to have sex with him,\u201d I said at one point, meaning to compel the \u201cstarving\u201d complication,but immediately recognizing the double entendre; luckily we are all grown-ups). She failed the roll, but Carrie paid to enter the scene, stormed into the tent, and rescued her friend. Terrence the minstrel wound up with the complication \u201cdetumescent\u201d as a result.<br/><br/>So I\u2019m enjoying the game immensely and am looking forward to the next session, when we will get to see the First Crusade reach Antioch. I think there will be lots of opportunities to push the characters even further and see what they\u2019re made of. Already Clark\u2019s monk has begun to transform, becoming disillusioned with the Crusade and its bloody consequences (I had him essentially make a Will save after the battle of Dorylaeum, during which he was almost captured by a Turk but escaped and hid until he could make it back to friendly lines).<br/><br/>In summary, I like the breadth and sweep of this historical fiction campaign, and I like how CF\u2019s character focus makes that possible. I think it may need rules for adversaries that are situations rather than specific opponents, but that may just be me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378644/#Comment_378644" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T10:19:45+00:00" title="May 16, 2012 10:19AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is awesome.
