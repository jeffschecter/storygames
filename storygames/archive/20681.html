Here's an example of what I'm thinking of, though:<br/><br/>You're playing a game with specifics rules for fighting and character powers. Suddenly you get to this situation where one character wants to reveal themselves in court to make an impassioned speech. They're hoping their loved ones will forgive them.<br/><br/>None of that "Sword of Flashy +5 vs. Orcs" stuff is too helpful, and the rules aren't really helping you adjudicate the consequences of this dramatic moment. Here's where you can pull out <i>Burned at the Stake</i> to lend a little mechanical weight to such a situation.<br/><br/>Basically, you can throw it in at any time when what the character cares about matters more than their combat skills (or whatever other things your game measures). It's not about character competence, but rather about what's at stake.<br/><br/>You're right, though - for many, many games it will be quite redundant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453981/#Comment_453981" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-20T18:08:14+00:00" title="June 20, 2016  6:08PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this could produce play that's more fictiony (passionate character!) or gamey (strategic player using character as pawn) depending on how it's parsed.  So, I'll suggest this text to emphasize fictional causality:\n<blockquote>1) When your character REALLY wants to succeed at something difficult, they should ask themselves what they can do to push their odds.  Look at the Master List for inspiration.<br/><br/>2) They can do other things not on the list, of course, but only these list items will give you, the player, extra dice.  Once you have a sense of what dice-gaining actions they COULD do, then decide which ones they're WILLING to do.<br/><br/>3) Play dice accordingly, roll, and assess victory and consequences as per the stuff Paul wrote.</blockquote>\nJust because that's my taste.  Also looks fun to me in a gamey, collaborative story-making way as is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453982/#Comment_453982" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-20T18:50:47+00:00" title="June 20, 2016  6:50PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2016 6:51PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Dave!<br/><br/>My personal process for using these rules is best described by the example of play.<br/><br/>Here it is in slightly more detail:<br/><br/>* A character is in a tense situation and really hoping to accomplish something.<br/><br/>* We all look at what's happening and how, and ask each other questions.<br/><br/>* During that process, some potential dangers come up. Anyone can bring these up and ask the player if they want to deal with them or not. It's best to frame their decisions in terms of the character's actions. ("How are you doing that?" is your best friend here.)<br/><br/>- "Hey, you're running pretty fast, and there's bullets flying everywhere. Either you or your companion could get shot right now. Are you being reckless enough for that to be a danger, or are you trying to stick to cover?"<br/>- "Well, I'm not being careful myself, but I'm doing my best to stay in front of my friend, to shield my companion from the fire. If a bullet comes my way, I'll be the one taking it."<br/>- "Ok, so let's mark that - you could get serious injured. OK?"<br/><br/>* The player decides which are relevant and whether they wish to mark them.<br/><br/>Perhaps there is a way to rewrite this process to focus on that a little more. As currently written, it's fairly loose and allows the reader to interpret the gameplay as they wish - more or less "gamey", with as much or as little focus on the developing fiction as they like. However, if anyone wants to take a stab at a rewrite, please go ahead (in this thread, ideally)! I'd love to see that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453988/#Comment_453988" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-20T20:14:07+00:00" title="June 20, 2016  8:14PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Except if you <i>were</i> playing Hillfolk of course in which case that sorta court reveal is what the game already has mechanics for.
