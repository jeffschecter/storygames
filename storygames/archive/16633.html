For those who don't know, it's a mashup of In a Wicked Age with Archipelago, made by some person [Edit: Jamie Fridstrom] on this forum who I don't remember (help me out here?). I've not played either game by themselves, so I couldn't say that this is better than either, but it's certainly a fun game in its own right. The situation that comes out of the Oracles is detailed and kinky and slightly uncomfortable, and then the system in play is just robust enough to provide unexpected outcomes and tough decisions.<br/><br/>One thing I found really interesting, coming off the back of some previous discussions here, was how the fact that we were consciously playing a mashup of two games, with some rough edges and unclear procedures, meant that we felt very free about improvising rules and procedures as we needed to. We passed some characters around the table, we interpreted the resolution system pretty broadly, and we improvised some scene framing rules. It felt good and kind of exploratory and dangerous.<br/><br/>A thing I'm really interested in exploring further is what exactly we were doing in terms of GMly stuff around the table - who was providing adversity, who was framing scenes, who was provoking more from the characters. We were doing all that stuff, but it was complicated and not explicit, and sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380521/#Comment_380521" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-02T00:06:04+00:00" title="June  2, 2012 12:06AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2012 12:07AM by Matthijs.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>It felt good and kind of exploratory and dangerous.</blockquote>\nThis is one of the feelings I love the most in role-playing.<br/><br/>EDIT: <a href="story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16335" rel="nofollow">"Wicked Archipelago"</a> is Jamie Fridstrom's idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
