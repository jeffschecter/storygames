When we upbraid a designer for publishing an unfinished game, we do not mean literally this: we only mean that the designer's workflow does not adhere to a set of standards we have personally internalized and accept as a valid gauge of completeness. Regardless, those standards are not universal or objective, and most importantly, they do not point directly towards the game as an object, but only towards the procedures of game creation: we criticize the lack of outside playtesting, for example, or lack of editing, or incompetence in explaining the whole game clearly, but on what grounds could we claim that the game itself is incomplete as an object? The best I've ever heard is a cry of incomprehension when the receiver has failed to understand the message; this proves only that this instance of communication has broken down, and tells us almost nothing about the game itself, lurking behind the message.</blockquote>\nTHIS. <br/><br/>is saying what im thinking but cant find the words for to write down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231859/#Comment_231859" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T15:05:41+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  3:05PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually just assume a game is complete unless I read or hear from reputable sources that it's not. <br/><br/>Although if the physical appearance looks like crap or if there's a page worth of errata, I tend to stay away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231864/#Comment_231864" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T15:22:57+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  3:22PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "incomplete" is too generic and too nice.

But that doesn't mean anything. We can't do that with novels or works of art or films, either. A thing is complete when its creator says it is. It may be a thing of really low quality, but that doesn't mean it was left unfinished.<br><br>In short, I agree with Shreyas here.<br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>There is a philosophical thing that a game is never truly finished, because (1) it's a creative thing, and (2) it's the beginning of a dialogue, even more so than something like a normal book.

Though I think the question here is really: "When is a game <i>text</i> complete?"<br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jumanji83</cite>This reminds me of George Lucas.

His alterations to his own movies are fantastic arguments against his opinion.<br/><br/>Also, this thread is full of good info and opinions for first-time designers to consider.
