He picks characters for the opening Scene \u2013 Jeremiah and Thomas \u2013 and decides Thomas will be the Main Character of the Episode.<br/>Luca introduces the backdrop for the Episode, and after thinking of the many possibilities (like maybe a room in a house, a vehicle, a hill, a mountain top, etc) and hearing out any suggestions other players may have, he decides to go for Aunt May\u2019s House. <br/><br/>Luca: \u201cAunt May\u2019s House has a very spacious Kitchen, with a large and study table, glass jars sitting on a cupboard, and an imposing brushed stainless steel \u201cside-by-side\u201d refrigerator. In the Living Room, there is a big red sofa.\u201d<br/><br/>With the backdrop ready, Luca now frames the characters into the scene.<br/><br/>Luca: \u201cThomas wants to steal the cheese from the fridge, but Jeremiah is guarding it! Well, actually the cat is asleep but the basket he is sleeping in sits right in front of the fridge, blocking the door.\u201d<br/><br/>Scene <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2301&amp;Mode=like">#01</a><br/>Luca begins to narrate Thomas\u2019 actions and shares how the mouse rushes towards the fridge, sees Jeremiah \u2013 who is fast asleep and snoring \u2013 and stops.<br/>Luca: \u201cThomas takes a fishing rod out of\u2026 somewhere behind his back, casts the line and hooks the basket. He begins to reel in, slowly moving the sleeping cat out of the way.\u201d<br/><br/>Giovanni (the current Producer, since he sits to Luca\u2019s right, raises a hand.) \u201cNope! Jeremiah was actually feigning sleep and was waiting for Thomas. He\u2019s got a pair of cymbals ready at hand, and as soon as Thomas gets close enough, he goes CLASH! On the mouse!\u201d <br/><br/>It is a Character Conflict since Thomas\u2019 actions as narrated by Luca affect Jeremiah. Because Thomas is pulling an item out of nowhere, the Stuffed-Up power applies. It is Luca\u2019s best power. Luca rolls 2d6 and gets a 4 which means it is a blended outcome. He turns to the Audience players and asks for Alternative Narrations.<br/><br/>Raffaele: \u201cSure, Thomas casts the line.. but it instead hooks into Jeremiah\u2019s nose! When Thomas reels in, Jeremiah wakes up screaming!\u201d<br/>Chiara: \u201cThomas draws out the fishing rod and casts, but the line trips down one of the jars on the cupboard. The jar falls and.. CRASH!!! The noise wakes Jeremiah up!\u201d<br/><br/>Luca: \u201cAll right, I choose Chiara\u2019s version. (Having selected the Alternative Narration, he resumes the narrative from there.) CRASH! Jeremiah wakes up and immediately begins chasing after Thomas, who runs to the Living Room and then straight into a hole in the wall \u2013 his lair.\u201d<br/>Giovanni: \u201cYeah, like it would be that easy!\u201d<br/><br/>Giovanni raises his hand to interrupt, then following the Carrot Rule, takes the Carrot from Luca to be the Cartoonist. Raffaele, who sits on Giovanni\u2019s right, is now the new Producer. Giovanni announces that Jeremiah is now the Main Character.<br/><br/>Giovanni: \u201cWhile running after Thomas, Jeremiah keeps clashing the cymbals together. The mouse tries to jump onto the kitchen table, but that\u2019s when the cymbals close upon him and SQUASH! The cat then grabs him and-\u201c<br/>Raffaele: \u201cNot so fast! You squash the mouse, alright, but then Thomas bounces around vibrating at the cymbals\u2019 tune, making everything which was on the table fall down. This buys him time to escape by hiding in the fridge!\u201d<br/>It is another Character Conflict. No particular power applies, so Giovanni rolls 2d6 and gets a 9. This is high enough for a success no matter what power was used, so Giovanni\u2019s narrative holds: Jeremiah grabs Thomas in his paw.<br/><br/>Giovanni gives Raffaele the Carrot, and everyone agrees that the Scene is over.<br/>Scene <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2302&amp;Mode=like">#02</a><br/>Raffaele is now the new Cartoonist. Chiara is sitting to the right, making her the new Producer. <br/>Raffaele: \u201cStill in Aunt May\u2019s Kitchen. The Main Character will be Jeremiah, who is about to eat Thomas. Of course, Thomas wants to escape!\u201d (Raffaele decides to narrate with a focus on Jeremiah, adopting the cat\u2019s point-of-view to make it interesting!) \u201cJeremiah is clutching Thomas with one of his paws. With the other one, he begins to prepare a tasty sandwich. \u201cSLURP!\u201d he goes and stuffs that pest of a mouse inside the sandwich, and splashes mustard on him. Then, he dons a checkered handkerchief for a bib, and CHOMP! Down goes the mouse in a single gulp!\u201d<br/><br/>This is a violation of an established Constraint. Chiara as the Producer has to point out that Thomas can\u2019t actually be eaten by Jeremiah. Further, she has to narrate how the scene instead resolves with Thomas\u2019 survival.<br/><br/>Chiara: \u201cAs Jeremiah bites the sandwich, he does not notice Thomas is squeezed out of it by the slippery mustard.\u201d<br/>Luca (raises a hand): \u201cEnter Aunt May! Does anybody oppose this?\u201d<br/><br/>No one does. Thus, Raffaele hands the Carrot to Luca, making Luca the new Cartoonist. Since Aunt May was entered to the scene, she is now automatically the Main Character.<br/>Luca: \u201cThe sweet old lady enters the kitchen. She notices the broken jar, the shards of glass everywhere, and gives out a loud shriek! She is mad as a rabid beast now.\u201d<br/><br/>Everyone agrees the scene is over.<br/>Scene <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2303&amp;Mode=like">#03</a><br/>Luna sets the Scene. <br/>Luca: \u201cWe are still in the Kitchen. Aunt May is the Main Character. Aunt May arms herself with a broom and is screaming: Jeremiah! You dumb cat! What in tarnation have you done?! Get out of here!<br/><br/>\u201cShe runs after Jeremiah, beats him on the head with the broom repeatedly, grabs him by the tail, and literally throws him out of the Kitchen! All the while, Jeremiah is desperately trying to point at Thomas. Seeing the mouse, the old lady screams again \u2013 and this time tries to hit Thomas with the broom!\u201d<br/>Giovanni (as the Producer): \u201cSecond Constraint triggered! Remember, Aunt May will always blame Jeremiah. She can\u2019t blame it on Thomas. So, Aunt May does not see Thomas at all. She hits Jeremiah, and throws him out of the house for good. <br/><br/>And that\u2019s all folks!\u201d                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
