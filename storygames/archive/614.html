                    Is it just me, or do your players have a really hard time wrapping their heads around the idea that NPCs might lie to them?  No matter how counterfactual my NPCs are ("No, really, the sky is green!"), the players always get this shocked and surprised look on their face when they eventually figure out that, yes, they were lied to.  They often say things like, "Wow, I never would have expected that," even when it's clear to observers that the character in question has been lying their ass off, and the character not lying introduces serious plot inconsistency.  Unless I hugely exaggerate the "I'm lying" signals (inability to meet the players' eyes, for example), they just don't consider the possibility that NPCs might lie, no matter what the other evidence for it.<br/><br/>So, is this true in your games?  If your players have a hard time accepting NPCs who lie, do they have an easier time accepting lies coming from PCs?  Are there techniques you use to make them treat your NPCs more like real people who might deceive and manipulate them?<br/><br/>I've got a couple of theories about why this might happen, but I thought it would be good to see if anyone else has this issue before I rant too much.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                </div>

Yes, I used to have that problem.  Dogs has some really good advice about it, basically: Make it plainly obvious that they're lying or hiding something.<br/>

                            Do you have your NPCs bite them in the ass? Like HARDCORE bite in the ass? <br/><br/>Do you ever tell them to roll or question or do whatever system thing you do for catching lies? Or just tell the player OOC -- they're lying, do you want your character to figure it out? <br/><br/>Do you ever have NPCs who are so very obviously lying that you could never believe a word they say? <br/><br/>I realized that I do all of these things. In one of the games Mo and I are playing right now we frame everything like a graphic novel. So I will describe an "elsewhere" scene in which an NPC on stage does some terrible thing, then in the very next scene comes in and lies about it to Mo's character. So Mo knows damn well about the lie, and has to figure out what to do with it. Eventually, even when she hasn't seen the NPC lying, she just knows he is.  <br/><br/>Once that becomes a habit, you can ease up on the gas.                        </div>

                            I have the opposite problem.  Everyone assumes my sweet and innocent NPCs are lying, backstabbing psychopaths.  When I complain, they just say "But we know you, Claire!"  Which is somewhat unanswerable, really.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I do a lot of things considered lying tells when I'm thinking.  My dad is exactly the same, particularly with the looking up and to one side.  People who've read pop psychology articles on the subject and consider themselves fine judges of whether a person is lying are hard to convince that I'm telling the truth, let alone my NPCs, even when given evidence to prove it.  Then they get all indignant at me for some strange reason.<br/>

                            Well, I think this is pretty obvious. Many players have been conditioned to believe that dialogue from NPCs is actually just the GM providing flags as to the way the "adventure" is "supposed" to go. Because really, that's one of the few flags most games offer for that sort of thing. It's considered, like, good form in illusionist play. Because heaven forbid the GM just come out and tell them something up front or aggressively frame a scene or anything; that would be cheating.<br/>
<br/>
It is a hard habit to break, since it involves pretty basic assumptions of "what RPGs are."                        </div>

My players are also very trusting when it comes to the NPCs.  On the other hand, I played in a game where you could guarantee that if an NPC was introduced with some sort of personal connection to you, they were going to fuck you over again and again until you killed them or got them killed.  Even the character's grandmother was secretly plotting against your 8th generation vampire.                        </div>

<p>I used to run <em>Amber</em>.</p>
<p>I would have NPCs tell the PCs something and both <em>preface</em> it with "Bear in mind, everything I'm about to tell you could totally be me lying," and then end it with, "Unless I'm lying to you in order to serve my own agenda."</p>
<p>Player conclusion?  "Well, obviously, if he were <em>actually</em> lying he wouldn't warn us that way, so it must be utter and complete fact, the bedrock word of God."</p>
<p>You want my opinion?  It is a player tactic, sometimes unconscious, sometimes deliberate.  In exactly the same way that people who do not want to back down from a fight will leap into conflict <em>daring</em> the GM to kill their character, players who do not want to face difficult thinking will leap to obvious conclusions, <em>daring</em> the GM to go through the effort of educating them about their own stupidity.</p>
<p>It's one of those things that's self-correcting if you have even one player who gets that NPCs lie.  Because then, as GM, you can just say "Oh ... that guy gets it ... so it's not me, it's just that this other guy's being stupid ... cool, I can screw with him!"</p>

                            I think that some of this may be a miss-applied dynamic (not realizing, on an unconscious level, that the GM is speaking in character). <br/>
<br/>
Some of it, however, is that the GM, whether running an NPC or describing the world, is the player's eyes and ears to the imaginary situation. <br/>
<br/>
I like the Dog's solution where lying is always (or almost always) really obvious.<br/>

                            I agree with what people have said to explain the behavior--players often code whatever the GM says as 'true' information even when the GM tries really hard to flag otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure part of it is simply the experiential conflict of the situation--they only see one person, the person to whom they turn to get accurate information on the game.  Even when the GM plays 'other' people, they can't quite suspend the 'this person gives me accurate information so I can act' impulse.<br/>
<br/>
I have had the same problem with my players, with an occasional swerve to the opposite side of the fence--when they do discover an NPC is a liar, or has committed some other morally questionable action, they become suspicious of everything they do.  And I mean everything.  It has frustrated a few efforts to build in an NPC redemption subplot, because as soon as they code them liar, they expect nothing but evil from them.  ("OMG--He's offering to buy our characters dinner, he must be in cahoots with the cook to poison us...").                        </div>

<p>Yeah, I had this problem. And it hit me that the reason it was the case was what Marco's saying, that the players have no senses the the GM doesn't give them in older style games. They have extremely limited narrative power, so they're in a double-bind typical of GMed design: the GM is their only avenue to truth, and can give false information.</p>
<p>I think this is partially the question of the Players not being allowed to know things their characters don't know. If the players know that the dude's lying but the characters don't ("Roll to see if you know he's lying") then you have this great situation where players conspire to have their characters find stuff out, or stumble into something unknowingly while the players savor the situation. It's like watching a horror movie: you're yellin' at the screen, "Don't go in the basement, you idiot!" but then she does, and you love it.</p>
<p>It's significant that Dogs' solution to this is "Tell the players then find out if the characters know." It's the same thing as rolling to see if the PCs see the clue. If they don't, they have insufficient information and the game can't continue. It's a problem with its roots in linear pre-planned scenarios, GM fiat, task res systems, and underdeveloped narrative power of the players.</p>

                            Larry, <br/><br/>Sure. The PCs lie to my NPCs all the time. Sometimes without telling me that they are doing so. If I want my NPCs to know the difference, they have to roll -- just the same as a PC would. (Assuming we're playing a game where we handle lying that way, of course.)<br/><br/>I think Marco is getting at something important too, that old deal about the GM giving you clues to lead you to adventure and ultimate victory is a bid deal, and deeply imbeded both in game texts and the practice of many games. So if your players are coming up in a world where they have to believe every word the GM says to them (because in that power dynamic of game the GM is the sole gateway to the SIS), then it is hard to take "gm statements" as different than "npc statements." <br/><br/>I'd say that accounts for a part of the problem, but not all of it -- because I've seen the same thing happen with new players who were playing in player-driven Nar games. At that point I think part of what Tony says comes into play, that it's just easier to assume truth and hope you don't get bit in the ass. <br/><br/>I think there may also be an issue for some people of "the person who is the GM is my friend, and my friend wouldn't lie to me" going on at some folks, at however unconcious a level. For new players in games where the IC/OOC split is a large line this makes sense -- they aren't used to the weird world of "acting" that RPGs partake in. But even with experienced players who would expect other PC character to lie to them, as soon as the trusted authority figure is the one speaking the lie, their blinders go up. <br/><br/>All of which get taken care of quickly with things like the Dogs method, or the scene-framing method that I talked about above. But then you get into the issue of if you want to surprise the characters, or want to surprise the players, and so and such and on and on.                        </div>

                            In my Aberrant game one of the characters has a Lie Detector ability (mechanically, he spends a resource point and I have to tell him whether whoever he's talking too is lying or not). It's been <i>awesome</i>, cuz he'll turn it on every other conversation, and then I'll just be all "yah, he's lying about X,"and then the character can dig for the truth, and the other characters can disbeleive him because he's kinda a sketchy guy, and so on.<br/><br/>It's a cool mechanical quirk that occupies another slot on the PC knows/doesn't know | Player knows/doesn't know matrix.<br/><br/>For a lot of my games, I won't decide whether an NPC is lying or not until the players start acting on one assumption or the other.                        </div>

                            Hmm, I can think of two (rather different) examples.<br/><br/>In one example, the PCs had convened a meeting to get support from various allies (and some enemies) to put together a secret attack against another antagonist.  During the meeting, one of their enemies was very hostile and reluctant to participate - this was meant to be a Big Flag that something was wrong, but they took it as an invitation to embarrass this person in public even further.  They managed to get a promise of support out of Ms. Hostile . . . and then they were shocked when the promised support didn't materalize.  The players kept asking me, "Where are the people she promised?"  It didn't occur to them that she had lied and had no intention of keeping her promise, even though I tried to flag it at the time.  When they eventually realized it, they were like, "I can't believe she lied!!" even though this NPC has lied to them and betrayed them a number of times in the past.<br/><br/>In another example, the PCs were trying to investigate whether a contact of theirs was dead or alive.  I introduced a character who lied and said that Mr. Contact was dead, while the PCs' own investigations turned up evidence that Mr. Contact was alive.  Nonetheless, they refused to believe the factual evidence, and spent most of the session operating on the assumption that Mr. Contact was dead - even though the lying character was known to be vicious, lying, cynical and selfish.  When they finally encountered Mr. Contact, their reaction was, "I can't believe she LIED to us!!"<br/><br/>I give the PCs a lot of agency in my games, and I encourage them to actively check in regarding the shared fantasy - for example, they can ask me any question they like, and tell me why they should know the answer, and I'll answer it for them.  Or they can go ahead and make up any part of the shared game world that doesn't directly impact another player, as long as they make sure to tell me what they're inventing so that I can be sure it doesn't conflict factually with something they don't know about . . . so I'm not sure that it has to do with the GM-as-arbiter-of-truth bit.  But it could!<br/><br/>Personally, my hypothesis is that it has to do with people's inability to hold in mind too many nested mental states.  ("I have an internal representation of my character, who has a representation of your character, which is really several possible models that I have to reason about . . . ")  Though I think the point that others have raised regarding the GM-as-trusted-figure is a good one too.<br/><br/>Next semester I'll be running a series of experiments to try to get to the heart of this, which is part of why I brought it up . . . looking at RP expertise, GM trust level, and first-person vs. narrated discourse as the possible factors having to do with the degree to which players can imagine characters lying, and comparing it to the ability to detect unreliable narrators and characters lying in traditional fiction.  I've already gotten some other good thoughts from this thread, though, so if you folks don't mind I might add "degree of hierarchy/authority between GM and player" as another criterion, or maybe test GMs and players separately depending on the experimental design.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

This sort of set up boils down to "You have to ask the right questions" and people tend to assume that the default answer to all their potential queries are "yes".

So if a player says to me, "Is she telling the truth?" and I ask back, "How are you trying to find that out?" then it's a stonewall?<br/><br/>You're right, though, I think I don't really mean "unless they had some actual way of knowing."  I was thinking about one example where they got a letter and wanted to know all kinds of things about who wrote it and how and when and what they were thinking at the time, when some of the characters couldn't even read. <br/><br/>Honestly, though, I'd be thrilled if my players even thought to ask "Is she lying?"  It seems that they often don't even think of it.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Jess, <br/><br/>How tightly are you wanting to linke the players ability to figure something out to the character's ability to figure it out? <br/><br/>I mean, I see how you're doing it now, but how much of that is because of a choice you've made as to how you want the game to be structured, and how much on the assupmtion that the players ability to interact with the world is automatically channeled through that of their character? <br/><br/>And even then, what kinds of limits are put on character abilities? In the letter example, for instance, would it be possible for the non-reading character to take it to a Greek slave he knows, and get the expert to deconstruct the letter for him? Would that be handled by a roll, by GM fiat, or some other system? <br/><br/>Note, these limits can be implicit as easily as explicit. I've played in lots of games where I never told the players that they couldn't use NPCs to get answers about other NPCs (especially in cases of hiring experts, mercenaries, or whatever), but in which the Players, when questioned about it, would answer in some variation of "I didn't know I could do that" or "but a hero should use their own skills" or "yea, but how would I handle that in the system?"*<br/><br/>All of the above issues have a large impact on what kinds of solutions you can use.<br/><br/><br/>*I was made very happy in a half-played one shot of a HeroQuest Tekumel game when the PCs dealt with a group of bandits by bribing the local temple guards to follow the bandits home and kill them in their sleep. It worked so well because it let them use their "Rich" traits against the bandits in an extended contest to make the bandits dead.                        </div>

<code>How tightly are you wanting to linke the players ability to figure something out to the character's ability to figure it out?</code><br/><br/>Hmm.  Depends on the situation and the game.  Sometimes I want the players to be challenged narratively, sometimes I want to elide things based on their characters' experience which I can't accurately express to them, sometimes I want the players to be saying, "Man, I wish my character could just know what I know," sometimes I want them to be giggling up their sleeve at what their character doesn't know.  There isn't one single answer.  It ranges from, "Okay, so your character understands the economic changes in western Gaul, even though we're not establishing them explicitly with the player, but we can figure out how this will impact what your character is doing," to "Yes, you know that Aniketos is being possessed, but your character doesn't, and I bet you can't wait until she figures it out," to everything in between (though I'm not sure that these are actually two extremes . . . but I hope you can see what I mean).<br/><br/><code>And even then, what kinds of limits are put on character abilities? In the letter example, for instance, would it be possible for the non-reading character to take it to a Greek slave he knows, and get the expert to deconstruct the letter for him? Would that be handled by a roll, by GM fiat, or some other system?</code><br/><br/>If they've got a Greek slave, or money to hire one, or whatever - then yes, absolutely.  However, the rule of thumb is that random action will always be less effective than using your own narrative investment.  So if a PC says, "Hey, I have ten sesterces in my pocket, I'll just go to a random scribe and get him to deal with this," that's going to be less effective than the PC saying, "Hey, I've been involved with this school to teach Greek culture to new citizens, I bet a teacher there could help me."  Both would definitely work, because they're narratively plausible, but the latter would be much more effective than the former.  The players understand this, and they definitely take advantage of NPCs in terms of solutions.  (In fact, these days I have a hard time persuading them to leave the house themselves, as they've all got tons of NPC connections who can just do things for them!)<br/><br/>We turn to dice when the player isn't happy with the response that they've gotten.  So, for example, if they didn't like the answer that the Greek slave gave them, they could roll to see if they got a better answer out of the slave.  Or sometimes I make them roll when there are no narrative constraints that make it easy for me to decide what they should find out!<br/><br/>This is actually really useful - I'm so used to doing things this way that it doesn't even occur to me to talk about them or make them explicit.<br/><br/>I love your bandit story, by the way.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<code>Jess, you have all those different ways you want to use player and character knowledge. Do you use the same system to arbitrate all of them?</code><br/><br/>Hmm.  Like I said, I have never thought about my GM style in quite this way, so let me write some random stuff about this and see if something interesting emerges.<br/><br/>When the player wants to know something that the character doesn't, that usually happens in OOC social discussion.  Like, for example, one PC stole the comatose body of another PC's greatest enemy, but told PC 2 that he had killed her.  We decided socially that the player of PC 2 should be there to see the scene in which he spirited the body away, because PC 2 was so excited about it.  <br/><br/>When the player wants to know something that the character will also be finding out, they have to explain how the character could know it.  See the Greek slave example above.  Usually this means giving me a narrative explanation, I narrate back, and we go to dice if I need advice about how much tech to give the player or if the player is unhappy with what they get.<br/><br/>When the character knows things that the player doesn't, we usually just discuss in general terms what the character knows, and I remind the player to tell me that they have this undefined knowledge whenever they're making plans or taking actions where they think it might be relevant.  Then, when they're actually trying to do something concrete, they can say, "Hey, remember that my character knows about who has recently arrived in Gaul from Rome?  I should totally be able to know if the messenger has showed up yet."  This is a way of signaling that the character has made a narrative investment, as in the Greek slave example above, and we'll use it accordingly. <br/><br/>When neither the player or the character knows what's going on, we do nothing until and unless there's a reason to.  A reason can be narrative as well as character-based: we'll occasionally say, "Meanwhile, in another part of the city . . . ." when it makes story sense to do so.<br/><br/>Finally, there's another category that I want to bring up, which is when the players and characters know things that <i>I</i> don't.  With three GMs, six players, and a lot of player responsibility for inventing parts of the world, this happens a lot.  In that case, we almost switch GM/player roles until we're back in story territory that's my business, and they get a lot of authority to work things out however they like.  I will suggest taking it to the dice if necessary, but only if necessary.<br/><br/>The threads that I see are minimal mechanics (only when narrative is failing someone), player responsibility for knowing what they want to incorporate, and heavy social decision-making.  Does that make sense?  Does that answer your question?<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Well, I don't lie to the player - NPCs lie to the character.  So if the player is using an NPC as a resource or having a conversation with an NPC, then they have to consider the NPC's own motivations and nature.  This is particularly tough when the player is abstracting things a little bit, so I always make sure to flag things that they have only opinion/hearsay about rather than fact, by saying, "Well, that's what so-and-so SAID," as opposed to saying, "This is the truth that you've found out."<br/><br/>As far as distinctions between the systems, it's generally clear to the player whether or not they know what's going on, and whether or not they're knowing it as a player rather than as a character.  I'm not even sure how to make it any clearer than that.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Jess, <br/><br/>Sure. But if you're sitting there lying to them as an NPC and they have all of these understood but only half-conciously focused systems running in the back of their mind, what is their first reaction likely to be? <br/><br/>"I am being given information by an NPC, I should...." <br/><br/>a) Think about what my character would think about that and react based on that<br/>b) Think about the drama of how to deal with that information and react based on that<br/>c) Consider my narrative investment into the statement and react based on that<br/>d) Logically deduce OOCly what I know about the character and react based on that<br/>e) Logicaly deduce OOCly what I would know ICly and react based on that<br/>f) Talk OOC about if they are lying or not<br/>g) Ask OOC if there is a way that I can even figure out if they are lying or not<br/>h) Figure out myself, OOCly, if they are lying or not and act based on that deduction without explicity talking about it<br/>i) Express my disconent and go to the mechanics<br/>j) Any combination of the above<br/><br/>At this point your groups great strength in their flexiblity and social systemic process is quite possibly causing an overload. You talked about this when you'd suggested that there are only so many nested scenarios that a person can deal with at once -- suggesting that at least some of the time you have players doing, say, A D and H at once, and overlooking the possibility of doing B, F, and I all together. Too much going on all at once, combined with assumptions about who has the responsibility to challange what, and you've got a big amount of stuff to deal with. <br/><br/>Not that your system is unusable, I think. It is, but until the players get used to doing specific things with it I think it would help to have a slightly more formalized system for the short term purpouses of establishing procedure. Once they get a handle on making that "are they lying" part of the regular course of the game, then you can step back and let it flow again.                        </div>

"A puzzle" doesn't mean anything to me, because I don't start with preconceptions about what is really going on or what is happening in the world.  Both the players and I are constantly improvising in response to each other.  Over the course of the game, we'll build up a library of established facts and past relationships and events that we have to make sure not to contradict.  Beyond that, what happens in the game is based on narrative reasoning (mine and theirs) as well as dramatic principles (we're doing an epic tragedy, so when they invoke their flaws they will tend to succeed in ways that set them up for future failure).<br/><br/>Maybe I didn't make this clear before, but when a player asks me a question, I'm <i>inventing the answer on the spot</i> (unless they're simply asking for previously established information, in which case I'll answer if I can or send them to the group record-keeper if I can't).  The game will radically change in response to the kinds of questions that the players ask, and they know this.  Asking about the motivations of the characters will make it a more political session; asking about the layout of their house means that we'll prepare to take it toward combat.  Questions are a major way for players to shape their experience in the game.  It's how we structure the largest part of player pro-activity that isn't directly connected to speaking or acting in character.<br/><br/>Let me give you an example from my one-on-one Ars game last night (where I'm technically the player, but my partner uses the same techniques as we've developed them together).  My character is a Quaesitor and she was trying to find out why one of her subordinates had done a shoddy job with an investigation (and also to discover whatever he'd missed!).  This sounds like a classic "puzzle" situation, right?  What actually happened went something like this, though: <br/><br/>I asked a bunch of questions about why the subordinate had turned over the investigation to someone else, and voiced my hypothesis that this had to do with his ongoing conflict with my character over the extent of his duties, and that while the case appeared to go one way, there were three other possibilities which I outlined.  My partner took that information from me (which included both facts that I established in the types of questions I was asking, and ideas for what might be going on) and selected the most narratively reasonable elements, then fed them back to me in answers to my questions.  We never turned to dice (in this game, we haven't done so for about six months) but we were both quite pleased with the way that things turned out - a plotline which picked up on long-term interpersonal issues in the relationship between the characters, addressed some related thematic issues regarding pride and authority, and resolved the current conflict only to create another one.  Neither of us could have done it alone. <br/><br/>I did notice (and I think that this is going to take a lot more work and analysis) that I was moving back and forth between the states of mind that Brand listed in a very systematic way.  It's just that it's hard to describe because it's all internal, not dice-related, and because it's so deeply connected to what's going on in the story at a particular moment as opposed to trying to deal with story and mechanics separately at a conscious level.<br/><br/>I think I've rather effectively derailed this thread  ... sorry!<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            I do want to add, for the record, that this is not the <i>only</i> way that I play.  My play styles range from fairly crunchy-mechanical to this nearly-diceless narrative-reasoning approach.  I just think that it's a lot harder to talk about the latter, which is why I'm trying to articulate it as much as I can, even if I'm not doing the best job in the world of being clear.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>No, I don't have enough information to determine that. What determines that is what you decide on.</p>
<p>If you were using Dogs in the Vineyard, you'd wring it out of the townsfolk and the players would know well in advance of their characters who was lying, though perhaps not why (that's what makes the game fun).</p>
<p>If you're using D&amp;D rules, you're making a Gather Information check Ã¢â‚¬â€ if you make the roll, they tell you, and if you don't, you lack the information that they even know anything.</p>
<p>In Dogs, the issue is "How do we find out?" In D&amp;D it's "<em>Do</em> we find out?" Those issues are implicit in the rules. If you're making your own rules up on the fly, I think you need a way to determine which attitude you're taking.</p>

                            I guess what I'm trying to say is that the rules are there in a way that's more than 'being made up on the fly': they're just not mechanical.  But I think this is really not coming across.<br/><br/>The best way that I can try to describe it is that it's "How do you find out?" - but not asked from the players to the GM, but from the GM to the players.  The players decide the kinds of things they're interested in, then signal that to the GMs by questions, suggestions and actions.  The GM in return asks, "How do you find out?" They could fail to find out, but only if they can't figure out a narrative reason why they could find out.  The "what" they want to know and the "how" they find out both matter.  Does that make more sense?<br/><br/>Again, I'm sorry if I'm not being very clear, but I think that this is quite different from what many other people here do.  I don't have a lot of vocabulary to talk about it with, and talking about this is <i>really hard</i>.  Nonetheless, it's worked extremely well for our group for the past six years (even if the system we're using may have something to do with the lying-dififculty issue).<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm still a little nervous about talking so openly about this, because I don't want to be attacked as, "You're just a bad fiatty GM who doesn't allow player autonomy or authority!"  In fact, our players have a huge amount of narrative input and authority, and there really is a (mostly diceless) system here.  What's hard is deconstructing the ways in which we negotiate that process, because I'm really used to doing this and I don't know too many other people who work the same way.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

Your system sounds a lot like the grown up version of what I used to do in grammar school.  By which I mean: it doesn't sound pure fiat, or de-protagonizing.  And I can clearly see how it would do certain things really well.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible that the entire system lives in your play contract, but if you could describe it mechanically, I'd be very interested to hear about it.  On the other hand, maybe that ought to come out into it's own discussion?                        </div>

                            Jess, <br/><br/>I don't think you're a bad GM. I think you're a very good one from everything I've seen. <br/><br/>It's just that every system ever made by humanity has strengths and weaknesses. It is inevitible. So your system, which rocks in many ways, also causes hangups in other ways. Its just the way life goes. <br/><br/>The real trick is to learn from each others systems and game designs to maximize utility while minimizing weakness. So anyone that just dismisses you and your experiences is making a fundemental mistake.<br/><br/>P.S. I sometimes play much the way you do. It depends on group, goals, and game. In a solo game with Mo, for example, we do a lot of the techniques you talk about and rarely get funky with the mechanics. OTOH, in large group games with lots of thinking, rather than feeling, issues at the table heavy mechanics exploration is the norm for me. So I do know at least some of what you're talking about from personal (and functional) experience.                        </div>

                            Jess,<br/>
<br/>
I am half of a podcasting duo but I'm just the brawn and Jeff's the brains.  I show up and talk with him into the purty mic and he does the techie stuff.  But if you e-mail us at sonsofkryos at yahoo dot com, I will forward your recording questions on to Jeff and he'll likely respond.<br/>
<br/>
We have recorded sessions with just an iPod on the table with one of the mic's plugged into it and it came out pretty well.  Recording at cons can be tricky because the rooms tend to be noisy but we've done it.<br/>

<br/>
We are hoping to record more sessions this summer with me, Jim and Jeff, because two members of our group are leaving town for the summer and we're running a series of one-shots.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you have any questions, just drop me a line.<br/>

                            Technically speaking, this doesn't even need to be centralized.  Just an index of audio recordings hosted in various places would do just peachy.                        </div>

                            Funny moment happened last night at a game I was GMing and I immediately thought of this thread.<br/>
<br/>
A PC's abusive father sees his son after years and the son asks how his mother is, as the son has been in a mystical OtherWorld for a few years now.  The father says she is dead, died of grief when she didn't know where he went.<br/>
<br/>
The player picks up the dice, "I want to roll dice to discover that he is fucking lying!"<br/>
<br/>
Awesome.<br/>
<br/>
The player rocks his roll.  Dad's lying and the son knows it.<br/>
<br/>
Now I thought this meant the father had killed her but no, it came out through play that the mother was still alive and the father was hiding her from an evil in the OtherWorld.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thought it was worth contributing to the discussion about truth and lies among NPC's at the gaming table.                        </div>
