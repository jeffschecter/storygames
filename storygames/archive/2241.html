                    So, suppose you have one player, who has one internal conflict for their character.  You, the GM, present an external conflict.  There are multiple techniques for making sure that this external conflict helps and highlights the internal conflict, and that the conclusion of the two of them happens in synchrony (and often due to each other).<br/>
<br/>
NOW ... suppose you have <i>two</i> players, each of whom has one internal conflict for their character.<br/>
<br/>
Do you mesh a single external conflict with both internals?  If so, how?  How do you make it connect to both?  How do you get all three things synchronized to each other?  What sort of connection does that imply between the two internal conflicts, and how does that play out?<br/>
<br/>
Do you expand to two external conflicts?  How do you keep <b>those</b> working together well with each other?                </div>

<p>I was thinking about something similar to this yesterday.</p>
<p>I'm working on a '40s-'50s-style, rocket space patrol game, using deas I worked out in <em>Depths of Kanthe</em>, plus a few more things, like tying personal values to external conflicts. The basis of this (not completely worked out yet) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>roll up the starting situation and flesh it out (conflict between miners and space pirates, for example;)</li>
<li>while playing out the conflict, plot twists will occasionally occur, making the situation more complicated;</li>
<li>some of those plot twists will be external, but some will link to internal values.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a space patrol game, the internal values would be pure and simple, maybe with two per character, each a single word from a list (Love, Honor, Duty, Justice, Compassion, Courage) interpreted in either a positive or negative manner. The two words are combined into a single one-sentence description of the moment of decision when the character chose to join the patrol.</p>
<p>I'm aiming at random creation of situation in potentially GMless play: random results (probably a coin-toss on a playsheet listing external and internal conflicts) occasionally indicate a plot twist, and sometimes this twist invokes one or more of those words and indicates it manifests either positively or negatively. For example, the results "positive Love" might indicate an NPC in the current scene suddenly expressing love; "negative Duty" might be a suggestion from an NPC to disobey orders. For my purposes, there's no indication of what the player should do: the player can choose how to react, if at all. This means I'm treating the moment of decision as a player flag, giving the player opportunities to address the character's personal issues.</p>
<p>There's no explicit synchronization between two player's values, but the plot twist mechanics cause the situation to snowball. If your Duty value was invoked (central command issues an order to execute the space pirates) and I'm in another scene where the pirate queen expresses her love for me, our internal values may come into conflict, based on each of our decisions. Do I let the queen escape? Do you order me to execute her and I obey? Do you do it yourself, without asking me? Do I convince you to not execute her, but take her back as a prisoner and request a more lenient punishment?</p>
<p>I kind of like this "serial synchronization" approach. Instead of force-linking two internal conflicts into every external conflict, let the conflicts slowly collide.</p>

i'm gonna get all zen on ya tony.  there is no external conflict.  there's really only one conflict in a story, everything else happening around it just makes that internal struggle visible, and also allows the struggle to be overcome.<br/>-Nate                        </div>

                            This is exactly the problem I had when running Nathan's "Carry:a game about war "(which is a great game, plug plug).  Each character has a burden they carry internally and you get to throw lots of external conflicts at them.  If the players really take ownership of their burdens, then they'll usually meet you half way.  If not, its very hard to pull the internal conflicts out of them and into external stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I need to develop my skills for managing internal and external conflicts.  Anyone got a good reference or game that helps you with it...                        </div>

                            What I do (and what FLFS codifies in Situation Engineering) is to take the players' chosen internal conflicts and then knit them together.  The brother that you're always trying to show up is Amy's drug supplier.  Her husband, who wants her to quit, is Jim's boss at work.  Jim is stealing from the company -- specifically, drugs.  And he sells them to your brother.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nate</cite><i><b>AM I BLOWING YOUR MIND MAN?</b></i></blockquote>I like Fred's response <i>a lot</i>.  In theory, all conflicts are part of one single universe working itself out ... indeed, Buffy's internal conflict about trust is <b>in no way distinct</b> from Xander's internal conflict about self-worth.  In theory, <i>physical objects</i> are an illusion created by our minds.  There is, in fact, just a huge mass of molecules operating upon each other, and the idea that I am in any real way distinct from my car is a pleasant delusion.<br/><br/>But in practice, we draw divisions, because they help us operate within the world.  I distinguish myself from my car.  I distinguish external conflicts from internal ones.  So, your zen is very zen.  Now let's move on :-)                        </div>

                            Shreyas:  Why is that <i>necessarily</i> core to the conflict?  It can be a detail, not fundamental.

<br/>
Yes, you <b>can</b> make a conflict that is specifically about proving yourself to Baron VanGuy, in the same way that you <b>can</b> make a conflict that is specifically about proving yourself by winning the PokÃ©mon League championships.

                            As I discussed in my <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/buffy/adventuredesign.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Buffy Adventure Design</b></a> essay, I tend to not set up external conflicts per se.  Rather, for Buffy adventures, I toss in monsters (or sometimes humans) who are symbolic of a general field and I see what conflicts develop.  So, I'll have something like a ultra-male/macho demon, or faeries who fight for the fun of it, or somesuch.  <br/><br/>In general, I find that careful planning of my plots -- like trying to mesh external and internal conflicts -- simply doesn't work for me.  Instead, I toss a lot of stuff into the pot and some things end up meshing.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><br/>Yes, you <strong>can</strong> make a conflict that is specifically about proving yourself to Baron VanGuy, in the same way that you <strong>can</strong> make a conflict that is specifically about proving yourself by winning the PokÃ©mon League championships.  But I don't see that you <em>have to</em>.  Am I missing something?</blockquote>
Assuming that we're talking about stuff that we write down on character sheets, if somebody wrote down "prove myself" on their character sheet, that tells me almost exactly nothing when I'm GMing.  It does not communicate much information, and puts me in the position of <em>guessing</em> who the character wants to prove herself to, why, how, in what time frame, and so on.  Now, some of those things can be created through the fiction, absolutely.  But I sincerely doubt that the player writes down "prove myself" without at least some ideas and preferences of how he wants that to play out.  Might as well write that information down, so we can all be on the same page.<br/><br/>As for connecting internal conflicts to other people... yeah, that's the point.  If you have this "internal conflict" in your own head that your character is all emo about but it never affects or touches any other element of the fiction, in my august opinion you're being an ass player refusing to play the damn game with the other people at the table.  If you want to prove yourself, I want to see you want to prove yourself.  Which means there's a scene where your character <em>does something</em> about that desire, and presumably that scene has other characters in it, takes place in a certain setting, and has dozens of other concrete details about it.  Cause really, if you want to imagine crying in your room alone, why are you coming to the table to do it?  You can do that alone in your room.<br/><br/>Unless I'm totally misrepresenting what you mean by "internal conflict," Tony?                        </div>

                            What I tend to do when running carry (which, as Jeffrey says, is very much about external events impacting internal conflict) is find out situations that touch on the Burdens of whichever characters are in the scene, and then turn it over to the players (via the stakes resolution mechanics procedures) to say how those situations will impact them. The procedure is that, once a conflict has been identified, the GM sets the losing stakes for the characters, but each player sets their own winning stakes. This is reinforced by a mechanic wherein conflicts that have to do with your Burden allow you to bring in more resources in order to win them.<br/><br/>Say Adam's character has a Burden "Must prove himself" and Bob's has a Burden "Can't let go of the memories of those he kills" (both of these seem to be internal conflicts, how you're describing them - am I right, Tony?)<br/><br/>As the GM, perhaps I frame them into a situation where the Sergeant, who has been fairly antagonistic throughout the whole game, leaves the two of them alone with a pair of VC operatives and says "when I come back, I expect them to be dead."<br/><br/>Adam here gets to set his winning stakes. Let's say he says "Ok, If I win, I grit my teeth and shoot em both, clean dead. This is my chance to prove that I can be a good soldier."<br/><br/>And say Bob says "Holy crap, I can't deal with the guys I kill at night in the jungle, let alone in cold blood in a shack. If I win, I talk Adam's character into helping me stash these guys out in the rice paddy, and we'll lie to Sarge."<br/><br/>And, in this case, I would probably call this one a conflict between the two characters, as their intentions here are opposed. If they weren't opposed (say, Bob's winning stakes were that, if he wins, he makes himself watch Adam's character kill them without flinching), then I would set losing stakes that hilighted their Burdens. Like, for Adam, I would say "If you lose, you take so long steeling yourself that the Sarge comes back, chews you out and then shoots them himself."<br/><br/>Tony, how does this strike you?                        </div>

                            JBR, Mike:  Yes, conflicts need details.  All I'm saying is that the details are not always <b>people</b>.  The "connect the NPCs that a conflict refers to with each other" technique seems to assume that the details that make the conflict come alive are always NPCs.  As I've tried to point out, they can be <i>other things</i>.<br/>
<br/>
What if one PC wants to prove himself to his father, and another PC wants to overcome the violent urges that his cyber-soldier upgrades are pouring into his head then it is no longer as simple as saying "Okay, we'll make his father be the cyber-soldier upgrades."<br/>
<br/>
Now there <i>may well</i> be a technique that would imply something like "No, we give his some connection with the soldier program," or "We give his father violent urges that he can't control," or something like that ... and if so then I'd like to tease that more broadly-applicable technique out.                        </div>

Regardless of their source "overcome violent urges" is the desire.  "Cyber-soldier implants" is color, not an obstacle.  The single scene external conflict that springs to mind is that the father becomes the target of the urges.<br><br/>As much as this is an integral part of FLFS's Situation Engineering, this particular technique might usefully be called "meshing," seems to me.                        </br></div>

                            I'd make the father the guy who put in the implants, personally.  And yes, make him a likely target for violence.<br/><br/>I see our disconnect, Tony; my example used all characters.  Just as easily you can share conflicts like two characters wanting the same prop, or two characters fighting over legislation that has different effects on their lives, or two characters trying to take control of the Theives' Guild, or whatever.  Point being, you can take an element from one conflict and "mesh" it together with an element from another conflict, and now those conflicts are connected (and probably conflicted).                        </div>

                            Excuse me while I take a step back and wiggle a little.<br/><br/>I think Mike is onto something here, that's sort of related to the conflict-desire-obstacle thing.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>"I want to prove myself" isn't a conflict, because it has no external object.</blockquote>
I don't know that the conflict always has to have an external object.  I suspect so, but I'd give maybe even odds that that's the case.<br/><br/>If you frame the conflict as:<br/><b>Desire:</b> Overcome violent urges<br/><b>Obstacle:</b> Cyber-soldier implants.  In my brain!<br/><br/>...then how do we see that?  Playing that character, I could have whole internal monologues about how I wanna kill everybody, but I'm holding on...  or not.  And who would know?<br/><br/>Honestly, I think the implants are color to the urges, the same way that the father is color to the proving of self.  In terms of it being a conflict, the implants don't meaningfully stand in the way.  It can be tempting to put some straining noises as vibrating eyes in there as our hero strains to retain control, but that's not a conflict yet.  Putting a specific in the way of that resistance can be though.  Like the father of the other character, so that then our cyber-soldier is the obstacle that he can overcome to prove himself.                        </div>

<p>I'm not sure that it's possible to discount the conflictosity of the implant, but I feel that for something to be a conflict, in the "character/desire/obstacle" format, the character and the obstacle both have to have the ability of making decisions, or in the case where one of those is not literally a person, then it has to have choice-like behaviors. If it's not responding dynamically to the other entity, I am tempted to call it something different and treat it as though it is much less interesting.</p>
<p>So with regard to "prove myself", I don't think that this desire is conflicty without someone to offer the proof to, whose conditions for proof may be unpredictable. This recipient of proof might be the character himself, or it might be some outside person, but (in my speech, and this may be a regionalism that you don't share) proof is <em>for</em> someone. It's an argument about something, and talking to the air simply isn't arguing.</p>

                            No? Nothing?<br/><br/>In Carry, you can have a Burden be "I want to prove myself," and then the events of play create the circumstances in which you actually, like, prove yourself. Or not. Or whatever.<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be detailed up-front.                        </div>

                            In LitCrit terms, Judson, your example is a conflict, it's just not a very interesting one to an outside observer.  The process you're talking about is externalizing the conflict: taking the conflict that is there but isn't readily experiencable by the audience and putting it in terms that they can experience and relate to.<br/><br/>The obstacle does not have to be external for it to be a conflict.  Internal obstacles are just really tough to make engaging to external audiences.                        </div>

                            There is a lot simpler way to look at this. Tony, you're worrying about picking locks vs. kicking down doors when you haven't even checked to see if the door is already open.<br/><br/>Let's say there are two characters with two internal conflicts and you are trying to cook up some external sitaution that will throw those internal conflicts into relief. You can either:<br/><br/>1. Just throw all kinds of external situations reflecting only one of the internal conflicts at the characters and eventually one of them will go 'oh yeah, hey look'. This is the trad gaming route, and it works marvelously and fuck anyone who says different.<br/><br/>2. Concoct with the players' help situations that they feel express the internal conflicts, then combine the two concurrently or consecutively. Then when one guys' conflict is "in the fore", the other guy isn't scratching his head, he knows what's what and can enjoy the scene either as a supporting player or as an audience. This is the hippie narration passing route and it works marvelously and fuck anyone who says different.                        </div>

                            it only becomes a conflict when the protagonist puts up resistance to whatever's happening around him/her, or to him or her.                        </div>
