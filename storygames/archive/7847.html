We look like we have settled on something cyberpunk, space infused, and potentially world-spanning.<br/><br/>One thing I wonder about is conflicts where characters find it difficult to directly affect one another. <br/><br/>For example, if word spreads that Tutenkhamen's tomb has been discovered, and the villainous bermudan millionare and heroic East Coast archeologist both race to be first at the dig, is this a kosher conflict? I can see it working in the first instance, rolling some kind of Resourcefulness Ability and pulling in Secret of Greasing Palm or aiding with a Geography roll. Does it break down at the Extended Conflict level though? It seems potentially trickier to come up with Opposed actions when they are not in direct opposition, just pursuing the same goal independently.<br/><br/>I'm also trying to pin down a few keys. I'd like a key of the True Believer, and a key of the Cynic. I've tried:<br/><br/>True Believer<br/>1 xp Share your belief in Aliens with another<br/>2xp Pursue a lead about aliens<br/>5xp Get evidence for Aliens<br/>However, I want to have the scope for alien encounters in the game, and if "Renouncing the Belief" is the buy-off, then things get fiddly or broke.<br/><br/>I want to have it generic enough that an astronaut and an anarchist conspiracist could both pick this, so I can't specify the key around government cover-ups (with a  Buy-off of "stop blaming the government [and move on]). I don't think.<br/><br/>Cynic<br/>1 xp Share your disbelief in aliens<br/>2 xp Ridicule another for belief in aliens<br/>5 xp rationalise away belief in aliens<br/>Buy-off: Accept that aliens exist<br/><br/>I don't know, maybe this one is somewhat weak? Especially if aliens show up in the game - that buy-off issue again.<br/><br/>Think for me, mighty brain.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173882/#Comment_173882" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T12:25:18+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:25PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: extended conflict and your example, I wouldn't worry about it.  Nobody will enter an extended conflict unless they care deeply about the result - that's the benchmark for entering extended conflict.  More likely they'll accept the outcome of the initial opposed roll.  If they care deeply, they will be invested enough to drive it toward a satisfying conclusion in extended conflict without your help.  Pay attention to their intents and make sure they aren't, in fact, parallel (parallel conflicts go by much faster because they are so brutal).  Make sure you encourage them to give up before they are broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173889/#Comment_173889" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T12:30:28+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:30PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your Key of the True Believer is really:<br/><br/>Key of Faith<br/>Your character has a strong belief that guides her. <br/>Gain 1 XP every time she defends her belief to others. <br/>Gain 2 XP whenever this character converts someone to her way of thinking. <br/>Gain 5 XP whenever this character defends her belief even though it brings her great harm. <br/>Buyoff: Your character renounces her beliefs.<br/><br/>And the Cynic is the same Key.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173896/#Comment_173896" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T12:38:02+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:38PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, and as for the buyoffs, it'll be your job to make them work. To me, if you have players with those Keys, any evidence brought into play about aliens needs to be controversial, easily covered up, or otherwise remain in question. If the existence of aliens is ever finally proven, then, of course, the Cynic will probably buy off the Key. But you can tease them by making sure that all those people who have the evidence are people the Cynic would never trust, and otherwise give him or her room to choose whether to keep the Key or buy it off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173902/#Comment_173902" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T13:03:58+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  1:03PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys. It's tricky, because the whole set-up is about humanity on the verge of contact by aliens. I'd like to formalise opposing views on the issue, as I think it would be fun story meat, but I don't want to limit the vectors of the players just to protect the operation of the keys. If they are wholly invested from the off in getting access to the prototype jump-ship and blasting toward the coded coordinates of the alien civilisation, then fuck it, they're meeting aliens that session.<br/><br/>Reflecting a bit, though, maybe the Key of Faith is the answer - if each character's KoF is specific enough, e.g., <i>The Govt is hiding the truth about aliens</i>, or <i>Aliens will be our salvation</i>, then the key can weather any broad plot reveal. I.e., tailor keys to individual psychologies rather than blanket facts.<br/><br/>Sound workable?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173912/#Comment_173912" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T13:42:17+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  1:42PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul has it, as far as the Keys are concerned: if the Key is about being sceptical about the existence of aliens, and aliens are proved in the game, <i>why would you</i> want to keep the Key, anyway? The game is all about change, the purpose of buyoff conditions is certainly not to always stay unfulfilled!<br/><br/>A Key might well be bought off in the very first session if the character goes through something that changes him that much. And if the character is a guy who's worked for the government for 15 years, proving again and again that there are no aliens... and then he finds incontrovertible evidence in the first session? That's not a problem, that's an opportunity for Key buyoff and character development! A player shouldn't go into the game with the attitude that this particular Key is such an incontrovertible part of the character that buying it off will ruin him. Or if he will, then it's up to the player to pick a Key that allows him to stick by it without feeling stupid. Heck, I could imagine playing the alien cynic who at first gets self-doubts when the mothership comes down, but further on convinces himself that it's all in his head. Yeah, he's insane, but at least he's coping somehow.<br/><br/>This is not to say that making the Keys more specific won't be a good idea. Then again, it could be worse, too, as it all depends on the nuances of what you're happy with or not. If it was me, I'd make the faith Keys all a bit standardized in such a way that each character wouldn't just have his own, idiosyncratic little faith. Much more fun to make the faith Keys something generic enough for several characters to share the same beliefs, for cults or churches to spring up around the ideas, for people to write or read books about them... that sort of thing. But individualized belief systems are fine, too, for certain sorts of campaigns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173914/#Comment_173914" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T13:54:50+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  1:54PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks, Eero.

You may do it differently and it won't break anything to just put them in XP debt, but it strikes me as limiting and inelegant.  <br/><br/>Secrets are not temporary.  If you want a temporary McGuffin to show up, just say "there's this supercochlear implant laying there; it does +2 Harm in any acute-hearing-related challenge" or "This megacochlear implant gives you a bonus die for finding your way out this particular government labyrinth" or whatever seems appropriate.  Or just throw them a bonus die from your stash.  That last one is best, but the system is very flexible.
