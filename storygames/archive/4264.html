Which means taking out the dice and replacing the cards with a gm who takes gives cryptic and unsavoury directives from the Roach.  Jonathan and I have been talking about writing freeform games, and one of the first suggestions he made was to make freeform hacks of storygames. He's got one on the burner for Dogs, and I don't know what else.  <br/><br/>So if it's so easy, why are we using dice anyway?  If the jeeps can do without them, what is our problem? Seriously, what do dice give that other procedures can't provide?<br/><br/>And questions for those who play freeform or diceless, how do you play without them? Why is it that you don't?

Conflict between players or characters isn't really a point, and especially not a point I want to focus on so much that I want to use specific mechanics for it.<br/><br/>I recently used an extremely stripped-down PTA variant to brainstorm a novel with a friend. We eliminated all use of budget and cards. We each controlled a protagonist, and took turns framing a scene for each other. We played until we reached conflict, then tossed a coin to see which way it went. The reason for using a randomizer at all was to push the plot in unexpected directions, so we'd end up with fresh ideas.<br/><br/>What makes it possible for a game to work dice free? I... it's a strange question. And don't take this as just flippancy: What makes it desirable for a role-playing experience to incorporate something as clumsy as dice and numbers? I play without dice because they require thinking about numbers, measuring things, comparing values; also, they tend to be part of larger systems that require tactical thinking etc. These, to me, are all hurdles and speed bumps, prices to pay for <i>getting to cool <b>narrative/dramatic structures</b></i>. <br/><br/>But yes, there are things you need. You need a level of trust and confidence, and a lot of role-playing experience doesn't hurt - although I'm not sure you need it. However, you do need basic social skills. You need to be able to listen, to pick up ideas and run with them, to talk in at least a slightly interesting fashion, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95869/#Comment_95869" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T08:25:43+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  8:25AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dice are completely neutral.

One thing you need to remember about cards through is they differ from dice principally in that they have "memory". Once a card is pulled, it is out of the deck and can't be played until shuffled back in. If you incorporate rules that downplay this memory aspect (like reshuffling after each draw), then you really aren't doing anything that different from using dice.<br/><br/>A good use of this "memory" is to emulate "ebb" and "flow" in a situation, and maintain balance. You'll never pull the worst card twice in a row (unless there are multiple worst cards, and even then, your chances are reduced), so you can often predict the flow of events with more certainty.<br/><br/>I generally avoid "randomless" games, because when running a game, I like the way that uncertainty in actions affects player actions. Instead of merely having the possibilities of "can" or "can't" when it comes to resolving tasks or conflicts, there's also the grey area of "might". Further, after years of play, a lot of players psychologically equate the roll of a dice with action or effort, which is a subtle way to achieve immersion I am loath to dispense with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95876/#Comment_95876" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T08:38:25+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  8:38AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just thought of another point.

And do you actually use them sometimes too?</blockquote>\nDice, as plastic randomizers, are just that - randomizers which can be used in various different ways; resolving stuff, guiding stuff, acting as resource, whatever. There's nothing inheritently bad or annoying in them, nor in other sorts of randomizers. I don't mind using dices or other randomisers, as long as there's a reason for using them - for me, it's usually using them to resolve a task or just to add suspense.<br/><br/>The dices, though, are usually connected to a larger set of rules which, especially in the case of Story Games, add structure to the game. They usually present some kind of goal for the game and means for the player to reach that goal. Dices add randomoness or tactics or whatever to that structure. In short, these combined tend to make up the Game -part of the roleplaying game; have a goal, have structure, play in that structure and reach for the goal, possibly using tactics and reacting to stuff as it changes. <br/><br/>I can do without that; I'm not really intrested in playing a game in the mechanical sense. It's not an integral part of roleplaying for me.<br/><br/>The other thing that adds to the structure is the Story; now that you mentioned Jeepform, they don't use dices or other randomisers - or even rules as such, to add structure. There is, however, the mentioned Story Before and techniques that keep the structure in place and act to deliver a story.<br/><br/>I can do without that as well; Story is not the intresting or rewarding part of roleplaying for me. It can be there, it can happen, but the structures that make Story Now or keep events within the agreed Story Before and an artificial hindrance. Less so if they are hidden from the view.<br/><br/>What that leaves is pretty the unstructured interaction and negotiation within the diegesis (fiction, in-character, whatever). And since the intresting part is to simulate and immerse into a human being, who interacts with other human beings and the fictional world. As that interaction and negotiation is pretty much a built-in mechanic in us humans (that's what we do and what we are), it's pretty easy to get by without the dice, structure or the story. Granted, dice can be used to add suspense or a random factor (usually in physical feats, since when playing tabletop, that's the one thing in human interaction you're missing) and there can be some kind of story (plot, whatever) to move things forward.

Those facts are indisputable, pure drama resolution, I say they happened, they happened. <br/><br/>During someone's second memory phase, their unpleasant memory, the first two questions were clearly leading the memory to be about adultery with the character's best friend's wife. This could easily be an unpleasant memory. Betrayal being unpleasant. I had the last question and there was no way this was going to be something as simple as adultery. So for the final fact of the memory, I declared that there was a dead body in the room. The player who's memory it was replied with a Holy Shit. Surprise. And they were then faced with the challenge of incorporating this corpse into their narrative, a narrative that up until then they thought was going to go in a much different direction.<br/><br/>So yeah, dice (or any fortune mechanic) can give you those two features, but they aren't the only way to get those two features.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95964/#Comment_95964" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T10:49:58+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 10:49AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>But given the starting example is getting rid of the cards in Roach, that doesn't seem to be the intent...</blockquote>\nI've taken to reading that a "there are no inputs into the game outside of the players' ideas and actions."<br/><br/>Then I'm back to my prior question-- if the only thing I can affect is what I say, what resources do I have that let me get you to play along outside of social pressure, or "being awesome enough to get you to play along" which is just a longer way of saying "social pressure"?<br/><br/>I mean this as a real question, and one that I believe has answers.

Example (which will require some knowledge of the game):<br/><br/>First Q: Did you have to work late that day?<br/>A: Yes, and I hadn't had a day off in two weeks.<br/>Second Q: Were you covered in blood?<br/><br/>The first person established the situation in a way the answering-player couldn't refute.  Instead, this person had to work in the suggestion and build upon on.  Then the second person comes in and throws out some completely different idea that doesn't build on the first one -- leaving the work to do that up to the answering-player.<br/><br/>The asking-players are taking on the roll of infinitely-sided dice here.  They need no context, and their contributions will not be refuted.  Certainly, this is far better for Paul's game that using dice or cards could ever be, but it's not as though the same purpose isn't served.<br/><br/>Now, to go to games that use dice -- like Dogs in the Vineyard -- I would be hard-pressed to see how this particular system (or the "tell me what it is that I did" in-scene system from APFMT) would work without morphing the game isn't an experience that is only Dogs in the Vineyard in name.

But we all have preferences and personalities, and over time, we will express those things. In other words, as individuals we are a little bit predictable. By conceding certain decisions to fortune, we are likely to encourage a greater sense of variety, by forcing decisions we may not have made otherwise. <br/><br/><b>2) The create a sense of risk</b>: Since noone can predict the outcome, players must evaluate the risk of various choices. This relates to the above. As individuals have certain personalities &amp; preferences, if decisions are left to negotiation or individual fiat, outcomes can either be predicted, or social pressure can be utilized to force certain outcomes.<br/><br/><b>3) Fortune changes the nature of play</b>: This will take a bit of explaining, I've written about this in my upcoming article for <i>Push </i>v2. So, "creating" content actually involves a spectrum of activities. On one side is "strict" creation---creating from scratch. On the other is re-imagining or re-interpreting inspirational material. <br/><br/>By conceding certain creative choices, particularly conflict resolution, to fortune, we shift the focus of play more towards (re-)interpreting, rather than strict creation. Are you following me? In other words, we, as players, are left with the task of interpreting what these outcomes mean for the fiction, rather than trying to make these decisions ourselves. It's a different focus that utilizes slightly different skills. I think this relates to the idea of "emergent" play.<br/><br/>Note, none of these are value judgments. Whether the above is desirable simply relates to individual preference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95990/#Comment_95990" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T11:13:20+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 11:13AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>Merten: good to have the immersionist perspective represented.

Mark pretty much nailed it with Technical Agenda and Predictability, I think. The latter is something akin to that since there's little attention paid to the dramatic and narrative structure, there's little need for randomization that adds to them or drastically changes things.<br/><br/>I'd hasten to add, though, that I'd love to see subtle use of structure and randomization. Like someone pointed out, "freeform" is good, but it's only one club in the bag and can be mixed with other techiques, as long as they don't step in too harshly and land a blow to the things that players used to "freeform" get out from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95991/#Comment_95991" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T11:13:30+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 11:13AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, Ryan, I don't understand what your statements have to do with my comment regarding how there are other ways to provide surprise and perverse elements other than Fortune mechanics.

In my mind, Drama requires context going into that situation rather than taking something and having to create the context for it after the fact.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh, and the irrefutable nature of what's said, that also adds to feeling like Fortune.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Throw the dice away - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4264/throw-the-dice-away/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Throw the dice away - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4264/throw-the-dice-away/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Emily, I was mostly referring to the fact that those games do not use dice.

Not knowing an outcome, without relying on that outcome to be provided by a person at the table.  What does that add? A hell of a lot.  Actually, one of the rules of Jeepform is a great pointer for this.  "Restrictions foster creativity."  Dice, for me, provide restrictions that more often than not, foster creativity.  With dice, I can pretty much choose to fail, and sometimes choose to succeed if the mechanics allow a way to bring in overwhelming odds.  Depending on the group, they might give it to me either way. But a lot of the time, success or failure (or whatever non-binary result) catches me off guard, or helps direct the story.  I might not have wanted to fail, but still did.  That happens to characters, and the fun is working within that new limit and finding the compelling story.  Because there is one.  Had I won, there might have been one there too.  Maybe I don't care either way, having the random element adds the restriction of success, failure, non-binary, and feeds my creativity.<br/><br/>Yeah, sometimes playing without dice is okay. Like in Jeepform, wel a lot of the stories are internally and externally driven.  It's a different mode of play, and it doesn't work for everyone and everything.  But a lot of the time, most of the time perhaps, dice provide an additional layer that helps foster creative play.<br/><br/>"What's our problem?"  There is no problem.  Dice are not a crutch that has to be thrown away any more than the rhyming pattern of a sonnet or the word format of a sestina. They are a part of our poetic toolkit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96047/#Comment_96047" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T12:38:20+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 12:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the people who answered Emily's question seems to think that "no randomizer"="no structure". For everybody who hasn't still read it, I would strongly suggest reading the Jeepform "Doubt", that you can download in english from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://jeepen.org/games/doubt/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a freeform scenario for 4 four people, and there is no randomizer, no "conflict or task resolution". But unstructured? It's one of the most structured games I have ever seen. There is a prep phase where the players in advance decide the setting, some of the characters, and the scene locations and theme. It's reminded me of Primetime Adventures. There are strict rules to follow. But every scene is uninterrupted by "game consiferation". And it's "story now", Mark, not "story before". You play it without knowing how the story will go. I would have been surprised at the beginning from what my character(s) did during the game, if I could have known.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Vincent, as always, nailed it.  Playing without having to "break the scene" to consult a randomizer or a system resolution is a good thing, by itself, but it limit what you can play. I enjoyed very much playing "doubt", but it is a scenario about love. I don't need a randomizer to tell me how to talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the next convention I played a freeform/larp game with some similar structure, and I enjoyed it until there was a scene with a sword fight.  And I felt stupid, mimicking a swordfight. I really wanted some system for resolving it out-of-view.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, I played a game of "Spione", and the story involved car chases, people shot in the head, etc, and the "randomizer" was a deck of cards that you put on the table in a precise way and then you "read" and narrate the events. It was like reading tarots to know what the future would bring to the characters.

These are codified systems (aka rules) for puting ideas in collision. Fortune (from dice, cards, whatever) performs an important role in the creativity exercises we call roleplaying games.

Here's the problem I had, which killed my enthusiasm, which eventually killed the game.<br><br>I (and I alone) knew the stats of the PCs and NPCs.  I (and I alone) framed the scenes, including the likelihood of conflict.  Since all conflict in the game is resolved with Karma based attribute comparisons, I essentially had to say what happened all the time.  I frame a scene and create a conflict, with full knowledge of who was going to win before I even began.  I realized that, without the dice to fall back on, I was the sole author of conflict resolution (save that between PCs), and it was very unsatisfying.  I think this is a variant of the Czege principle at work, yes?<br><br>So here's what I need my dice (read Fortune mechanics) for:  They provide impartial arbitration for events in the game.  There are plenty of things that can do this without fortune, Polaris and Beast Hunters take good stabs at answering this need in non-Fortune based ways.  Also, there's a certain thrill of <i>striving</i> for something when the outcome is in doubt, waiting for the dice to fall and tell you what happened.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96056/#Comment_96056" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T13:08:30+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  1:08PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily, inherent in your OP is the assumption that RPing with dice is inferior to freeform RP. That if we could only get the secret sauce of high art, we would all throw away dice and go completely freeform, as if dice are getting in the way of our enjoyment. <br><br>Here's my problem. I like dice. I like them on a visceral, irrational level. I like them in a way that I do not like cards or other randomizers. I like dice. They add to my enjoyment of the game simply by being there and looking shiny and fiddly. I like a good cigar. I like a well cooked piece of steak. I like rolly little pieces of plastic. Why should I look for ways to toss out something I enjoy?<br><br>Do I need a rational reason for that enjoyment? I could go into all the rational reasons about how fortune resolution adds uncertainty to the narrative and to outcomes. And I love that about randomizers too. I like being able to push forward a big raise in <i>Dogs </i>and know the other person is gonna have to narrate taking the blow or they're going to have to give. I like rolling in my Father's Gun 2d8 and then getting crap and having to incorporate that in my narrative. Not choosing to. Being forced to by fortune.

You're quite correct in detail - particularly if you want to get technical Theory-ish about it. I intended to shorthand a difference in <i>emphasis</i> which is really very much a continuum:<br><br/>At one end, stuff like <i>In A Wicked Age</i>, in which virtually everything about the content of the story is indeterminate pre-play.<br/><br/>Next, stuff like <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, where Issues, the "it's TV" conceit, and the franchise provide some direction for the general shape of story, but the outcomes of scenes are very much up in the air - indeed, relatively random.<br/><br/>Then you've got the vast middle turf of story-gaming, with structure reinforced by pacing methods (typically a currency flow of some sort) and "gameable" resolution that gives players more control over outcomes. <i>Dogs</i> is archetypal.<br/><br/>Now you're starting to get into the structure-heavy end of things, with much more nailed down in advance. Games like <i>My Life With Master</i> and <i>With Great Power...</i> live here, with their set story arcs, more or less determinate endgames, and resource-management-dependent conflicts. The narrative arc of these games is pretty consistent instance-to-instance, and even individual character arcs are often pretty "readable" from their initial states (although they can and do surprise you).<br/><br/>Way out over on the far end, you've got games with predefined characters, set scene agendas, rules tailored to produce specific story events over time... For tabletop, I think of <i>Shab al-Hiri Roach</i>, <i>It Was A Mutual Decision</i> (maybe), <i>Burning Empires</i>.<br/><br/>Note that <i>none</i> of these actually precludes Story Now in the Forge-y sense. Which is why I shouldn't have munged up the terms.<br/><br/>My feeling is that scenarios like <i>Doubt</i> substitute heavy structure, defined arcs, and preplay for in-play novelty and freedom for the exact same reasons why a tabletop game might: to allow deeper exploration of the spaces that ARE open within that structure - which are principally the "inner spaces" of character.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96064/#Comment_96064" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T13:17:15+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  1:17PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Why bring dice in in the first instance?

It is perhaps less easy for me to convince my friends that going diceless is awesome when we all grew up playing GURPS and they've only recently dipped their toes in the indie pool that is is for you, who has helped to fill the pool.  It's taken me a year to get them to try Polaris, but they're really digging it now.<br/><br/>My problem?  Now, I've not yet had the pleasure of trying freeform or anything like it, so I don't have much to say on that.  Perhaps that's my "problem."  However, I am finding my gaming currently to be rather satisfying.<br/><br/>I've already given my two cents on the third question.  Maybe I could turn this around:  Emily, what is it about dice (and other similar elements, like cards, roulette wheels, etc.) that you personally find unsatisfactory or lacking (if that is the case) that drives you to explore alternatives?<br/><br/>I tend to find them unsatisfactory in more traditional games, to be fair.  Perhaps we have some similar reasons or underlying ideas, and I'd like to know more because I'm designing in a very different direction lately, which still involves dice/cards/etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96082/#Comment_96082" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T13:53:25+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  1:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The dice debate is one that used to turn up not infrequently on RPGnet. Anyone who dared to advocate not using dice was usually viewed by the majority as the lowest scum that walks the earth. To me, this says that there's a lot of personal investment in the dice. <br/><br/>One of the reasons is that the dice act as a proxy for the player of what the character is doing. I roll the dice, he hits the orc. I roll the dice, he jumps the pit. This link is very strong and is surrounded by dice mythology and ritual that, as a mathematician, I find hard to credit. But there's no denying its presence.<br/><br/>Another reason is that players think that nothing exciting can happen without the random element. This even though, the dice are often only the final adjunct in a chain of circumstance that involved no dice at all. Sure there are stories about the surprise a dice has brought, just as there are about what a player or an NPC did next.<br/><br/>Another issue is that players are worried about authority. Having no dice is handing over authority to the GM. With many games, and with properly played improv, authority is shared, but besides that players find it hard to trust someone to this degree. Some players obviously, not all players. Part of this stems from the adversarial nature of many roleplaying games in which the GM is aiming to trick or otherwise disadvantage the player characters. Many players take very personally what happens to their characters. Character failure is equated with personal failure, not a roleplaying opportunity. Of course in many games character failure takes you out of the game or kills your character so they perhaps aren't far wrong. And so, having a neutral arbiter of the last part of resolution removes some of this tension - even if the GM can likely stack the odds anyway they please.<br/><br/>I'm always happy to play a game with no dice, no resolution system at all except trust and no blocking. What dice players perhaps don't realise is that this gives you even more control over your character and their destiny.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another issue, rewards. In many games, rewards are hard fought for. You roll the dice and take the risks, you've earned those rewards. With no dice, it's hard to know to what extent the rewards have been earned.

Ron calls this the "dramatic springboard." <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think there's another element to it. The dice can't be blamed. That is, let's say we're playing freeform. And you as GM have some tragedy befall my character... well... it's your fault. Which means that quite literally, I can blame you for what happened. Worse, you and I will both feel that I may have a right to ask you not to do it. To take it back. Even if I don't, there's a personal tension between us that, well, I for one do not want to have. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this feeling happens... even if I actually liked the negative outcome as dramatic to play. I can still feel like, "By what right did you decide in this particular case to have my character loose... when that other character won in a similar case the other day? I don't mind losing, but... why here and now?"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, I've agreed to play by some set of rules, and the dice make that bad event happen, then that tension cannot exist. If my character even dies, and I as a player hate that fact, and it makes me hate the system and never want to play it again, even... at least I cannot hate you, or even question your motives. Because the dice did it (OK, our agreement to use the system), not you. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a gamism situation, this sort of thing is absolutely neccessary, because you must have a level playing field. For narrativism, however, it's important, too, because otherwise I might think that you're hijacking my themes, or making negative statements on them with your authority, or... whatever. Dice (or other randomizers), avoid this problem. And we can all accept that the result was a good one if we're using a good system. Even if I can't see why the fallout from this DitV contest is good, I know that it'll be a lot of fun later. Sure, a GM could give this out by fiat, but, again, then I might have questions for you that'll go unanswered. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs that difference between us agreeing to the neutral arbitration of the dice, and agreeing to have somebody adjudicate more or less just ritual? Well, sure, but ritual is important. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96096/#Comment_96096" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T14:23:42+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  2:23PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2007 2:28PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>The dice can't be blamed.</blockquote>\nFuck yes. I GMed a freeform game once--and in this instance, by freeform I mean Total GM Fiat, via chat, with players who were used to the total character ownership style. Whenever they did something dangerous, I was supposed to decide how that turned out. At the same time, I couldn't just mutilate or kill their characters, right? Because that would be my solitary decision, not theirs. If we had used some fortune in there, I could have said, "If you do this there's a 33% chance you'll get severely hurt," and then they would have been the ones taking the responsibility for the outcome.<br/><br/>This frustrated me both in the responsibility I had and the suspense it took away.<br/><br/>ETA: Since people like actual play examples, here's a specific example. So these characters are Ancient Egyptians. The temple at Karnak is under attack by a huge swarm of locusts conjured by the rogue cult of Seth (a perversion of the true Seth believers, really). All three characters barely make it into the shelter of a temple building. But they hear screams for help from the outside. A priest hasn't made it in and is being attacked (and gnawed on) by the locusts. I ask them what they want to do, thinking there's a hard choice to make here. Without hesitation, they charge out to help him. What now? Should I decide they all get severely hurt? I could have, but that would have felt wrong.<br/><br/>In that moment, I wished for saying: "Sure, you can go out there, and on a 1-2 you'll make it back without damage. 3-4, though, you'll get scratched up, and 5-6 you won't make it back in on your own." It would have taken the load off my shoulders AND introduced tension.

When you use randomizers (dice or cards or whatever), you add some <i>noise </i>to the game.  I mean noise in the engineering or the information theory sense here. This turns the game into a stochastic environment, an environment where you can't accurately predict developments just by knowing the current state of things. <br/><br/>That randomness or flux or noisiness does several things -- for one thing, it can help create a sense of versimilitude, since we live in a chaotic universe.  But I think its most important function is to shake things up and allow new patterns to emerge in the course of play.  People are very good at detecting patterns.  They'll even see patterns when there aren't any.  In the mundane world, people spend vast amounts of time looking at data that's very noisy, such as stock market trading on a given day, or basketball players' performance in a certain game, or which table is the "winning" table at a casino on a given night.  <br/><br/>All of these things average out over time into greater trends and tendencies, but people love to interpret every zig and zag of the data and make up theories about why it's happening.  The so-called "hot hand" in basketball is a phenomenon that's been repeatedly debunked (in short, players have good days, and good players have more good days), but it's still a staple of sports broadcasting because it's an intuitively appealing explanation for what you're seeing over the course of the game.  <br/><br/>What relevance does this have for RPG's?  I think it means that randomizers take advantage of human cognitive biases.  This is valuable in at least two ways:<br/><br/>1) Using randomizers is a way to economize on scarce cognitive resources while still getting usable, or "interesting" content.  Fortune-in-the-Middle is a prime example of this.  Your archer character tries to shoot his weak opponent and --- [<i>roll, roll, roll</i>] --- <b>fails</b>.  Now that the randomizer's given you that bit of information, you can then try to fit that into the pattern of the combat.  Maybe he slipped, or the other guy dove behind a rock.  <br/><br/>Can you see how much easier it is for the brain to rationalize a random result than to come up with a complete event out of whole cloth?  <br/><br/>2) Besides the obvious, trivially surprising result of "I thought I'd hit him but I didn't," the noisiness enables a much more profound kind of surprise.  The SIS is constantly being blurred and reshaped in little ways by the random results, and that allows new patterns to develop.  Perhaps the archer character, having unexpected difficulty taking down his target, begins to look different.  Perhaps he looks ridiculous, and the player's conception of him shifts from "master archer" to "bully with a bow".  Or perhaps the player thinks, "my character <i>hates</i>looking ridiculous.  He's going to get pissed off at the guy who sent him on this mission."  Lots of subtle possibilities.  You could do the same thing in a diceless game, of course, but someone would have to come up with the idea beforehand. The beauty of the dice is the players are constantly being faced with noisy outcomes that provide fodder for interesting results. <br/><br/>Long post, curious to see what people think of this perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96106/#Comment_96106" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T14:54:12+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  2:54PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2007 2:54PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>In that moment, I wished for saying: "Sure, you can go out there, and on a 1-2 you'll make it back without damage. 3-4, though, you'll get scratched up, and 5-6 you won't make it back in on your own."

To use Christian's example, you could do, say, "I'm spending one of my Danger points to make this scene dangerous," which is the same level of fiat that a GM uses when saying "hey, I'm calling for a roll here."  The player could then decide to say "I'm spending one of my Luck to mitigate the Danger," or decide not to spend that currency then and suffer the consequences.<br/><br/>You naturally have to add in a compelling reason for both choices in your system, yes, but it has the potential function of divorcing "lack of randomness" with "uncomfortable social responsibility."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96136/#Comment_96136" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T16:01:45+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  4:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My stance is pretty much halfway between Mike's and DannyK's:<br/><br/>* The dice can't be blamed, which brings a feeling of neutrality (at the very least, we can blame "everyone" for agreeing to use the set of rules, rather than blaming "Mark" for doing bad things to me). This, to me, is more of a general sense of "why use rules instead of freeform" in part, but does exist.<br/><br/>* Also, for randomness in particular, it brings in 'noise' in the information theory sense that is more difficult to get from humans alone. This brings in additional input that I'd be unable to get from humans alone. Any roleplaying game (and by <i>game</i> I exclude most freeform exercises, which play without a 'net' and are thus just <i>play</i> without game) that removes randomness should have elements to replace it that bring equivalent value to what I lose by having the random element go away.<br/><br/>(I love the "noise" of randomness. The Wand of Wonder was my favorite D&amp;D item, and Chaos Magic my favorite thing out of AD&amp;D2's Tome of Magic.

It's highly railed and structured, where the situation the beginning of the track presents is about some choice you have to make between you and another player, giving you a few seconds to choose, and then telling you what happens based on your answer.  Essentially I'm trying a variant on Prisoner's Dilemma.<br/><br/>So, it depends on what we mean by "suspense," and how we can channel that otherwise.  Let's look at a non-random variant again: instead of calling for a role, you grab either a black bead or a white bead in your hand.

Does this play tend to pull the opposite of what I last pulled?<br/><br/>That is the difference between a human-based randomization and a third-party one -- you can better predict the outcome, making the game something perhaps more than it was.  But like I said earlier, I'm tinkering a lot with Prisoners Dilemma right now, and in longform that is about learned patterns (though, yes, what I suggested to Christian isn't PD).  Furthermore, when you get down to it that level of interaction could have further implications -- maybe a limited number of black &amp; white beads (we see an implementation of this idea in the game Cash 'n Guns).<br/><br/>In short, just because one instance may seem random doesn't mean it's random in longform.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96169/#Comment_96169" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T17:36:35+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  5:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christian wrote:\n<blockquote>In that moment, I wished for saying: "Sure, you can go out there, and on a 1-2 you'll make it back without damage. 3-4, though, you'll get scratched up, and 5-6 you won't make it back in on your own."

You've got a lot more solid insight into this stuff than most of us do.<br/><br/>To tackle your points in order, but briefly:<br/><br/>1. The way I see Fortune mitigating or working against groupthink is twofold. The first way is as the source of novel prompts/constraints that are not predictable, as Fred mentioned\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>In groups I already know, I crave the input of a randomizer that does not have patterns I can recognize from previous moments of play.</blockquote>The second is as noise in any attempt to coordinate between players - sort of the reverse of Fred's point.<br/><br/>2. "Meaningful" has a fairly literal reading here. It's possible to have purely (or largely) <i>formal</i> conflict - conflicts in which no one is strongly invested in a particular outcome, where nothing of significance is at stake. A meaningful conflict is one with serious stakes. Here, the randomizer is serving that "neutral arbiter" role of smoothing social tension over strongly contested stakes.<br/><br/>3. Part of my strong interest in this topic comes from my own experience that "good players" are not enough to reliably get good outcomes. Structure of some sort is very important in order to allow players to usefully converge on a shared agenda for play - otherwise what you often end up with is really good players who are pulling in more than one direction at once. Formal structures are not the only solution to this signaling problem, but they do have a long history.<br/><br/>Secondarily to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, I have heard anecdotally from more than one player who finds the kind of deeply attentive, heavy "on-the-spot" creativity required for freeform really exhausting. Structure can serve to apportion creative responsibility in specified and predictable ways, which reduce this stress. Fortune can go further, by actually taking some of the creative load off the individual players by performing that prompting/mediating role I mentioned in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>Wow. This is the best discussion of this topic I think I've ever had on the internet.

I just had a conversation with Graham via im where I had an insight into this issue wrt Improv.  <br/><br/>In improv, they talk about spontaneity and obviousness, which means that you are only working within the confines of what is close to or similar to what people have already introduced. Graham talked about this, how you build on one another. Then it dawned on me. They are training their instincts to be in synch with what the other people around them come up with. We do the same thing with the stuff on our character sheets (narrative cues) and dice.  They are just keeping us on the same page. Good free form structures do the same thing.  <br/><br/>Tobias wrote:\n<blockquote>Modulo that I don't own any anymore, I could use dice e.g., if I got stuck on equally interesting outcomes of a decision. (Left or right?) Frankly, the discussion about dice (or whatever) being "neutral" feels completely alien to me.

And puts pressure on a person even if they have no bias, as in Christian's actual play example. They are still put in a position of potential conflict of interest, even if its only about their preference for an outcome.  And if the person's job is to provide adversity, and also to be a neutral referee, there is an inherent conflict there. This may be too jargony. \n<blockquote>I don't have anything religious about using random elements in a jeepform game, as long as they connect with what the game is about.

Match the mood of the activity to the tone or theme of the game. That makes great sense. There is a real gain to matching the color, or feeling of a game element to a game.  But the functioning of the dice <i>can be</i> about positioning the real people in relationship with one another in a way that brings about strong, powerful story. By helping us collaborate, or by putting us at odds, by asking us to commit fully by giving us the freedom of weighted responses that are not dependent on our social skills or narrational ability. <br/><br/>I've been watching my game group play lately, noticing when the dice come out, how the energy intensifies.  We are engaged and excited when we have to make a roll. It makes taut the narrative string.  But it doesn't work that way for everyone. Could I get you to play long enough, Tobias, so that the awkwardness would melt away, and you'd come to appreciate the real function that the dice are playing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96210/#Comment_96210" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T22:57:33+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 10:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gonna try to answer the original questions.\n<blockquote>And questions for those who play freeform or diceless, how do you play without them? Why is it that you don't? What makes it possible for a game to work dice free?</blockquote>\nThe first one is a really hard question because... how are you able to play <i>with</i> dice?  There's no reason for that to be the default, aside from roleplaying arising out of wargaming and a few other traditions that were all mixing together in the 60s and 70s.<br/><br/>My list of reasons for avoiding dice in play and design goes something like:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Dice Encourage Lazy Design And Play</b>, because everyone knows how to use them, everybody's used to them, and relying on them means sticking with the status quo and not pushing yourself as much as you otherwise might.</li>\n<li><b>Dice Have a Particular Color That's Not Appropriate for Most Games</b>, just like playing cards or bronze coins or other physical tools</li>\n<li><b>Mechanics Without Dice Don't Have To Be Numerically Balanced or Internally Consistent In The Same Way</b>, which may take a bit of explanation.  If you're writing a system that uses only D6s, or uses a bunch of different dice but in specific ways, it's important to limit the kinds of design decisions you make to create a game system that's easy to remember and learn, one in which you're not constantly using a different set of rules for every different task.  You want consistency and elegance.  You don't want to roll 3D6 for Task X and then, the next time, be rollng 1D12+8 for the same task.  You have to make sure that the players gain and use resources at the right speed.  You have to make all the numbers work together like a well-oiled machine.  I'm doing this now for <i>Geiger Counter</i> and it is a royal pain in the ass.  If I was writing it using freeform guidelines (say, like Polaris' ritual language negotiation thing) instead of mechanics, I wouldn't have to do any of this.  I'd playtest the ritual phrases a bunch to make sure they created the type of play I wanted, but that's a whole different set of issues and, honestly, a task that's much more interesting to me as a designer.  I don't want to design perfectly balanced mathematical systems.  I'm a humanities major.  I want to create beautiful structures that are built on words, ideas, and themes.</li>\n<li><b>I Don't Want To Have To Be Successful Strategically In Order To Express Myself Effectively In Play</b>, including managing resources, doing probabilities in my head, maneuvering miniatures around, picking the best skill set, picking the best feats, picking a charm list that makes me be the badass I wanted to be, understanding the combat rules, etc.  If I decide I want to make a character who's a badass, I don't want to have to spend a lot of time working on it, making sure he's a badass.  He should be a badass because the group have decided that he is, not because I'm successful at maneuvering my way through the mechanical puzzle of making an effective character and taking strategically appropriate actions.  This is especially true if the rulebook DOES NOT TELL ME HOW TO MAKE AN EFFECTIVE CHARACTER at any of the major tasks that will regularly occur in play, but instead expects me to learn by making a bunch of ineffective characters and having them fail or get killed until I figure out an effective way to do things.  If I wanted to join a mystery cult, I would become a Mason.</li></ul>\nSorry for the spittle on the last two there.  They get me fired up.<br/><br/>Without dice, games work pretty much exactly the same way.  You have rules.  People follow the rules most of the time.  When the rules don't seem to apply as solidly, players negotiate a solution or someone just steps in to make things up.  The rules for games without dice just... don't call for dice (or cards, which do pretty much the same thing, only differently).<br/><br/>Or, alternately, games without dice work on a completely different paradigm than games with dice.  These are more exciting to me, I think, but less familiar and instantly grabby for most roleplayers, even really hippie ones.  Simon mentioned my game, <i>Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan</i>, which is trying to operate out of a completely different place.  Each of two players plays by a completely different set of rules which are complementary.  The rules are very, very specific.  Players can only make statements in character that correspond to particular sentence patterns, which tell you how your character can talk.  I was very much inspired by <i>Polaris</i> and Emily's games in walking down this path, designing a bunch of 2 player games (<i>Heavenly Kingdoms, KKKKK, Waiting/Tea, While You're Far Away</i>) that experimented with alternative play structures.\n<blockquote>And do you actually use them sometimes too?</blockquote>\nSure, I play games with dice too.  Because converting them all would be too much work, and I'm definitely post-Forge in the sense that I like having structure (System Does Matter) that supports the game I'm playing.  I'm not so much into the inconsistent-and/or-arbitrary school of freeform.<br/><br/>Emily, are you interested in talking about how to structure play without dice or resolution mechanics?

I go to sleep in systems which are big on point building. I find myself not caring if I have all the points in the proper place, it just means more adversity, right? Luckily, most games that I play don't demand me to do much point building or min-maxing. If I play one that does, I'm happy to be the less than silent rogue or the slightly out of tune bard, or whatever.<br/><br/>But I am trying wrap my head around the post above and how it reconciles with Dice encouraging lazy design.

Humans tend to connect the dots afterwards, not as they come or before.<br/><br/>Also, I think Mike is very much right saying that dice and rules are a safety net that can work as separation layer between player emotions and direct them towards a neutral source. Which is why I don't like them. If I get hurt in the play I want to feel the frustration and if needed, vent it out. However, I also want to be sure beforehand that I'm directing it against a person another player is potraying, not the player itself. Same goes for positive feelings. The difference during the play is minimal (though there is the player control which makes me say that I punch you, rather than punching you), but in general, it's the key social contract issue for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96249/#Comment_96249" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T04:50:41+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  4:50AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 5:02AM by Nathan_H.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i think dice are an easy buy in.  it's a small, unassuming looking thing, somehow easy to invest with your faith.  it simplifies and cuts back on the layers of human interaction.  it's a buffer zone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96252/#Comment_96252" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T05:45:00+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  5:45AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><b>Dice Encourage Lazy Design And Play</b>, because everyone knows how to use them, everybody's used to them, and relying on them means sticking with the status quo and not pushing yourself as much as you otherwise might.</blockquote>\nI think Lazy is a loaded term.

Amber Diceless is pretty groundbreaking in some ways, but, when it comes to offering a sophisticated diceless system, it pales in comparison to things like Nobilis, which has MUCH more subtlety, flexibility, and structural/mechanical power (and is strongly informed by Amber and Ars Magicka).  But I think, for designers who approach making games informed by the "structuralist" (as Eero calls it) tradition of the post-Forge scene, that the challenge of designing without dice means that their games are likely to be breaking some really interesting ground, since I doubt many "structuralist" designs will reach for GM fiat or other easy answers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96271/#Comment_96271" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T07:24:54+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  7:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the flip side Fiat ( player or GM) is a simple, often functional, resolution system.

The card says: "Describe how someone you thought was a friend is actually an enemy!"<br/><br/>...or<br/><br/>- The game has a strong focus on relationships. In dramatic situations, a die is rolled for each relationship involved. A 1 indicates a roll on the Change Table; one of the results is "betrayal".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kent" title="Kent"><img alt="Kent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kent">Kent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96335/#Comment_96335" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T11:46:11+00:00" title="September 15, 2007 11:46AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Err, yes?

Forces outside the players and/or GM in a group create unanticipated opportunities.

I think that this came up elsewhere a little while ago... Most of the more widely known diceless designs from the Noughties seem to have taken much the same route as <i>Nobilis</i> did in the Nineties: in practice they run on "rollover systems without dice" that mechanically and structurally don't differ to any great degree from their diced counterparts, except (naturally enough) for the reduced element of chance. The emphasis which <i>Amber</i> places on the good judgment of the GM has become something of an exception among those RPGs which resolve conflicts through other means than randomizers.<br/>\n<br/>\n(It still surprises me to hear some folks call <i>Nob</i> "crunchy", though.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96365/#Comment_96365" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T14:31:16+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  2:31PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This has made me think about what the dice are doing in my current design (the Pentasystem). I think they're doing two things.<br><br>1. Vincent, I think it was, talks somewhere about two approaches to design: you can design for what matters or for what doesn't matter. If you have a simple way of dealing with what doesn't matter, you can save your attention for what does. Now, the Pentasystem is about characters trying to change the world because of things they care about, what they're willing to risk for that end, and how the striving changes them. It's not really about whether they win or lose. So having "do you win or lose?" decided by a die roll moves that non-central question away from the focus. If it used some other method, like talking about the probabilities of whether you would win or lose in this situation, this non-central thing would get a lot more attention than it does when rolling some dice decides the issue.<br><br>2. Because every time a Pentasystem character engages in conflict they risk being changed by it, the random aspect of the dice is actually reinforcing part of what the game is about: risk. The player, let alone the character, doesn't know going in to a given conflict what consequences will come out of it. And the longer they stay in the conflict, the more likely it is that they will have serious consequences to deal with - but they <i>might</i> get away without any. <br/><br/>So, it's like anything else. What is your game about? And then choose mechanics that help it be about that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96419/#Comment_96419" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T20:06:01+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  8:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dice don't encourage lazy design.<br/><br/>Laziness encourages lazy design.<br/><br/>That lazy designers use dice is no more the fault of the dice than it is role-playing games' fault that a lot of us are fat.<br/><br/>I think if you're scared that you'll be lazy when you use dice, then say you're scared of that.

Maybe it will interest someone here, even though it's not very StoryGame.<br/><br/>I agree that randomisers can add suspense, a use not mentioned in that thread. I also agree that there are other ways of doing that. A secret-ballot election, for example, has suspense without randomness. I think that's a very interesting topic, and not one I've seen discussed much - where and how often in a game you pause for the equivalent of a drum roll before proceeding. And how often can you do it before, as in D&amp;D, the "rolls" (pun not intended) become normal flow, albeit with a rhythm, instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96886/#Comment_96886" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T09:56:38+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  9:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob wrote:<br/><i>Anyway, on another point, someone raised the question of why other people's actions can't be randomizers for purposes of inspiration, the same way dice are for some.</i><br/><br/>Other people's input may be arbitrary, but it will never be random.

Does this play tend to pull the opposite of what I last pulled?"<br/><br/>Yes, but even in some traditional games this can play a part, too.  Does the GM ask for higher difficulty levels when attempting actions that he doesn't like vs. ones he's partial too.  It's just degrees of non-random, but either way, you still have the system as a filter, even if the system is highly biased.<br/><br/>Emily said: "In A Penny for [My] Thoughts, for each memory you get a suggestion from another player. Then you get to choose which one, based on a gut feeling of which is right. Tension and responsiblity dealt with."<br/><br/>This is a great example.  Because there's a huge difference of intent.  The game explicitly promotes active listening.  You're supposed to provide a suggestion that the player is going to like. It's how you "game" the system so to speak.  Among players who don't know each other, a lot of it is feeling each other out, "What are they going to like, where are they looking to take this?" And among players who know each other, it's feeding into known wants and preferences.<br/><br/>If A Penny For My Thoughts had a random element, like instead of picking suggestions, they were put into a hat like the initial memory moments, you'd have a very different game. In this case, I think to a detriment. The whole aspect of learning from one another feeds into the theme and premise of the game. If it was random, then it would take on an aspect of challenging each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arref" title="Arref"><img alt="Arref" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nX3VMQSRREUB5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arref">Arref</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99100/#Comment_99100" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T19:09:03+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  7:09PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily</cite>And questions for those who play freeform or diceless, how do you play without them?

The GM provides NPCs and their motivations, including the histories of choice that these motivations involve. When conflict occurs the players provide the actions, thoughts, and motivations of their characters and the GM meshes that with the same from the NPCs and makes a judgement about the result.<br/><br/><b>What makes it possible for a game to work dice free?</b><br/>Trust and mutual understanding. At the outset of running a diceless game, especially with someone that I haven't played with before, I explain that: \n<ol>\n<li>We're all playing to have a good time and that, as the GM, I <i>want</i> them to have fun.</li>\n<li>That I am not going to arbitrarily kill their character.</li>\n<li>If they are confused about something or think that their character should know something about the game-world that I have not explained to them, they should not hesitate to ask.</li>\n<li>If they are uncomfortable dealing with <i>any</i> kind of situation in the game, that they warn me beforehand, if possible, so that I can avoid it.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>And do you actually use them sometimes too?</b><br/>Sure. Right now, I'm playing a game of D&amp;D. Last year, I ran an Iron Heroes game and played in a game of Lone Wolf. <br/><br/>Sometimes it's nice to emphasize the game more than the roleplaying.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite>I recently wrapped up a game of Amber Diceless that shed some light on this issue for me, personally. Here's the problem I had, which killed my enthusiasm, which eventually killed the game.<br/><br/>I (and I alone) knew the stats of the PCs and NPCs. I (and I alone) framed the scenes, including the likelihood of conflict. Since all conflict in the game is resolved with Karma based attribute comparisons, I essentially had to say what happened all the time. I frame a scene and create a conflict, with full knowledge of who was going to win before I even began. I realized that, without the dice to fall back on, I was the sole author of conflict resolution (save that between PCs), and it was very unsatisfying. I think this is a variant of the Czege principle at work, yes?</blockquote>\nI'm not saying that you were doing anything wrong, because I've seen Amber run the way you've described by plenty of people, but when I run Amber I always begin a new scene by asking the player(s) a variation of, "What are you doing?"<br/><br/>While this may not be explicit, this invites the players to frame the scenes and determine for themselves when conflict will happen.<br/><br/>I can't speak for my players, but I have found my Amber play to be quite satisfying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99802/#Comment_99802" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T12:58:58+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 12:58PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can have my dice when you pry them from my cold dead fingers!<br/><br/>Just kidding                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99823/#Comment_99823" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T13:40:35+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  1:40PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread has made me dust off a LARP idea I had that used "real" accomplishments to resolve challenges.
