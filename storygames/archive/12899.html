I'm thinking in all likelyhood I'd want to see 15-20 games and have it come in under $40 to consider getting it, as in all likelihood I'd be really interested in 3-4 of those at most. There are a couple of the NoPress Anthology that interest me, but it's only slightly piqued, and at $20 it seems a bit much without really knowing if I'll get anything out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290468/#Comment_290468" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T12:09:30+00:00" title="August 31, 2010 12:09PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite>Gamers love big, hardcover tomes they can use to kill anything from spiders to stray cats with.

You had to calculate sales (from about 3-4 different channels) and then subtract costs (which were different for each channel), and then split it multiple ways and then get checks to contributors and the like.  Giant hassle.  I should have just paid every contributor a flat fee, but that doesn't really make sense for an anthology.  How much is a multi-year license to print Dust Devils in an anthology worth, anyway?  Probably more than I have on hand, I would bet.  Better to pay a percentage of sales, but then you have the hassle again.<br/><br/>I also really, really doubt that the creators of the landmark indie games you are talking about would be interested in having those games be featured in an anthology.  It would be way better, I suspect, to do a kind of "Year's Best Indie Games" book that contained samples from all of them (but not the full game) or short games written by either old farts or up and comers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290504/#Comment_290504" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T13:08:17+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  1:08PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is also possible to make this anthology the driver, rather than make older games the driver. In the spirit of wikis: Just Do It.<br/><br/>Work up a payment model (percentage, probably), decide on form factor (digest might be cheapest; Letter might be necessary for thickness, per above), write up all the legalese (print permissions), and put out a call for submissions on all the design channels that you can. If Game Chef folks want to be in it, so be it. If someone with an old game they'd like to get seen wants in, so be it. Be sure the games are tested and not obviously broken, and then BANG: lay it out and head off to Lulu.<br/><br/>I've considered trying to do that for Icehouse games, but SO many of them are CC (and the rest have full copyrights) that there's no way to make it in any way profitable (literally--the book would have to sell for print cost; what's my motivation to do 100 pages of layout and editing, again?).<br/><br/>But just do it--put out the call, have a good proofreader standing by, set a deadline, and go to press. Give yourself a nice percentage for handling the organization (10-20% seems fair, similar to an agent's fee) and cut the rest out to the writers on a quarterly basis.

But even THAT's gameable if someone's getting greedy. Plus, it might be sort of unfair to "elegant" games that work with few moving parts, when compared to "chart monsters" that have tons of setting or details (or charts and tables).<br/><br/>I'd just make it even split and if folks don't like it, they can go to press on their own. The value add for someone submitting are several (thinking of my idea, mainly, but applies to the games-first idea):<br/>* Professional layout and proofing, including working with the designer on the "feel and tone" of ephemera like headers, rules, type, etc.<br/>* (Maybe) Coordinating art to suit the above, for those writers who don't provide their own. (Offshoot Idea! Also a chance for emerging artists to be showcased, paired with content that suits their styles!)<br/>* Coordinated, consolidated marketing and promotion (product web site, forums, cons, etc).<br/>* Profits without management (no need to hassle with a Lulu account, or do layout, or deal with customer refunds for bad copies, or make a product web site, etc).<br/>* Co-branding (if you theme each compilation), which means their games will tend to be see by fans of their games' genre.<br/><br/>It's a hell of an idea, the more I ponder it. Wonder how many folks you could get to sign on? The number (and quality) of submissions will dictate the ability to theme it and decisions about form factor (mainly book size).<br/><br/>I'd say do it!

Most of them are in 6x9 format, so have it be like the D&amp;D4e bundle, or like the Narnia boxed sets you can get. That way there isn't a huge deal of effort put in to doing the layout, but you still get the collection, and also the discount for getting a large number.

The limited run with up front payment strikes me rather like the Dragon Warriors licensers increasing the fee some twelve-fold and ending up with nothing as a result.<br/><br/>Is this supposed to be just another opportunity for devs to make some money? Or is it about suppling the community with more games to play? Or is it about expanding the community and bringing more people into it?<br/><br/>Whichever one it is would probably change how people feel about the money. I'd think in cases where certain games aren't selling much anymore, and most of the money that's to be made has already been made, just getting them in the anthology would be good enough, particularly with subsequent games potentially getting a spike in sales. Rather like certain video game devs releasing older games for free as marketing for a newer game in the series.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290607/#Comment_290607" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T16:20:21+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  4:20PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it turns out you need to do another print run, ask the designers if they want another payment.
