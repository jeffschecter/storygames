I negotiated a one-Saturday-a-month game with my wife and players. To make up for the infrequency of play and to help my friends who have to drive 60-70 minutes to get to my house (the best play space, anyway), we'll be play for 7-9 hours at a shot. We will discuss how many months we'll play. I want to ask for a commitment of 3 months or 6 months, with an option to re-up at the end of that time. I will promise to try to structure the campaign so that it ends with a bang at the end of our commitment. If we re-up, we can start a new saga, maybe even with different characters or even a different setting.<br/><br/>This first get-together, we'll lay out broad rules for the setting and make up characters. I've prepared a one-sheet with various things to think about during world design. We won't get too deep into it, but if they want airships, there will be airships. If they want high magic, there will be high magic. We'll talk out the rules that I will use to create the setting and they can give me specific elements to include and I'll do the main world design work. <br/><br/>In my playtesting of Keep on the Shadowfell, it seemed a group of 6 players could get through an encounter every 30 minutes. With start-up time and chatter and food and stuff, I suspect my new group will get through 10-12 encounters per game. Since the game is designed around 10 encounters per level, I'll just ignore XP entirely and tell players they level up between games. They can use the month between sessions to do their character build, preferably in a talky way online. Not worrying about XP makes me very happy.<br/><br/>Since they know they will level up every time we get together, they're free of the "we must kill these monsters to gain XP" restrictions. I am curious to see how players make decisions in this environment. I'm sneakily pushing for more Narrativist play here -- well, I will tell the players exactly what I hope happens and they can overrule me, I suppose, but I know these people and suspect they'll love it. <br/><br/>I also plan to hit them with Bangs -- really interesting situations that force them to make decisions that matter to the characters and to the players. This means understanding character motivations. When we create the characters, I will get the players to write down some relationships they have to NPCs and PCs and the power structures of the world. These will probably be "people who matter" (to the fictional people in the setting), so everything the PCs do will cause ripples or even splashes in the pond of situation in the world.<br/><br/>I'm trying hard not to start house-ruling till I have played the thing. So far, I'm only maneuvering inside the pretty spacious box the core rules set down. I'm tempted to add some kind of system that rewards Narr play, probably using Action Points or something like them. I have a system in mind.<br/><br/>To communicate setting stuff and game logs with my group, I'll start a wiki. Once there's something worth reading on it, I'll post a link.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147632/#Comment_147632" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T10:00:05+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 10:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to play in your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147639/#Comment_147639" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T10:15:55+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 10:15AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Move to Maryland. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147642/#Comment_147642" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T10:18:01+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 10:18AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I look forward to this--I'm going to be starting one as well--or at least one of the multi-session playtest games our group does ...

I actually talked to most of them online first to see if they were interested. Evite was just the formality to lock in the date. I amused myself by changing the "Will you attend?" answers to things like "Yes, a natural 20! Crit!" and "Maybe, does a 10 hit?" and "No, I rolled a 1. Critical failure." (No, 4e doesn't have standard rules for critical failures. Yet, anyway.)<br/><br/>Here's a run-down of my group.<br/><br/>I know all of them from the online text-based role-playing game I run (<a href="http://firan.legendary.org" rel="nofollow">FiranMUX</a>). Firan is going on its 11th year as an online game. Some of these folks have played there for 5-6 years. Firan is an exercise in extreme Sim in a lot of ways. Some of them didn't role-play much before joining Firan. In some cases, Firan might be their only RPG experience. They're all in their 20's or 30's, tending towards the lower range. Only one of them (Brandon) is male.<br/><br/>Kristin and Rachael are roommates. I met Rachael first on Firan. My first in-person meeting with Rachael was at GenCon a couple years ago. She and Kristin lived in Indiana then. Rachael played in an infamous game of My Life with Master that I ran at Embassy Suites. Rachael has a fair amount of tabletop gaming experience, even some indie experience. Rachael also played in my 4e KotS playtest a few weekends ago; she played the cleric of Bahamut. Kristin has much less gaming experience.<br/><br/>Brandon and Stephanie are dating. I'm not sure if Stephanie is going to play or not. She's the wildcard here. I don't know if she's interested in playing, or if she might play just to socialize or because Brandon is playing, or what. I'll need to watch the motivational thing and make sure it doesn't do weird things with the play dynamic. I like her and she's smart and creative, so I invited her. Neither of them has a lot of tabletop experience. Brandon played a couple games of D&amp;D before he met me. Since then, he's played in a number of indie games that I've run. He's a firefighter and brings a certain crazy fearlessness to his play.<br/><br/>Jen is married with two young daughters. I don't know her husband (he doesn't play on Firan and I've just never had the chance to meet him). She has some tabletop experience, some of it indie stuff at my house.<br/><br/>Lisa is returning to tabletop play after a hiatus. She's played in two of my 3e campaigns, both of which ended with a fizzle when I grew frustrated with them or when players moved out of the area. (This fizzle is the primary reason we're re-upping at 3-6 month intervals.) I don't know if I contributed to her hiatus. In any case, I feel I need to make sure Lisa has a good time, more than usual. She's one of my best friends, too. Not that it's particularly relevant, but she's currently dating a somewhat well-known 3e (third-party) game designer / editor (who is also a good friend of mine). It seems like it could become relevant. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I really like these people as friends. I trust them. They're all creative and fun. I love running games for a mixed-gender group, especially weighted in favor of women. I find the play dynamics tend to be more interesting that way. I'm looking forward to seeing what these people do.<br/><br/>During play, I expect them to ask me stuff like, "Is there a smith here?" My plan is to return the question to the entire group, "Is there?" Perhaps with some aid or parameters: "It's a small town. They'd likely have at least a blacksmith, but maybe more. What do you think?" And if the pacing is begging for a challenge, I'll ask them to complicate their own lives: "Okay, so there's a blacksmith and (as you said, Brandon) she is an old elf who forged magic swords back in the day. But... why is she hesitant to help you?" Player: "Uh, after the war, she swore she'd never again forge a tool of death?" If a player doesn't want to create her own obstacles, other players can step up. If they don't want to, I won't force the issue. I'm capable of making their lives interesting, but I think it'll be fun to get their help. I think, after doing it for a while, I won't even have to ask.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147662/#Comment_147662" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T10:59:50+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 10:59AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a chance you can do bluebooking of some kind between games?

I want players to be rewarded by each other and not play "how do I make the DM happy to get my XP." I hate being in that role. I am all too good at manipulating players to do exactly what I want to earn their cookies, even if it's not fun for them. I did it for decades with 1e and 2e.<br/><br/>I also don't want the pace to deviate from one level per Saturday. I want everyone to level together. I want everyone to level predictably. I want the game to be less about doing the right thing to level and more doing the things they find fun already. <br/><br/>Yes, I have disconnected a very important bit of the reward system of 4e. I realize this is a dangerous thing to do. If it doesn't work, I will instantly go back to the rules. And I'll explain the danger of this to the players before implementing it.<br/><br/>If I do end up using XP, I'll give out XP for encounters and for quests, which I will use extensively.

I just need to pick up some suitable card stock. I have some perforated business card stock already and the templates for Word. Maybe that can be repurposed.

Its basically a "reverse dungeon"...<br/><br/><br/><b>D&amp;D4e - "The Slaughter at the Caves of Chaos"</b><br/><br/><i>In brightest day, in bleakest night, such injustice shall not escape my sight!<br/>Realms afar or scenes at home, wherever the cause should make me roam,<br/>Always I vow to stand for right, to combat the Villain with all my might!<br/>From Chaos comes the gift I give, to shed light's grace on we few who lived! <br/><br/>And there came a day, a day unlike any other when the "Villains" would flow from beyond the ravine, finding their way into your home - they had looted, they had pillaged, they had invaded your family's lives without care or compassion... It is told the Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Humans... they have no feelings. They can not love their children as you do. These "Realm Adventurers" had come many times and many times you and your kin had pushed them back. But on this day the Villains would not be stopped. It was not only for plunder, it was not for sheer destruction, it was more than that... it was to end your people, to wipe them from the Realm, from the world... from history... It was genocide. <br/><br/>Every last member of your race was slaughtered on this day. <br/>Every tribe-kin to the monster. <br/>Everyone but you. </i><br/><br/>And an echo voice in the dark whispers<br/><span style="color: #336633;"><i><b>"In dark chaos, hear me...<br/>it is not the end, you are not the last.<br/>Yet you are the last best hope.

With the aid of D&amp;D4th Edition, players will take the roles of the "monsters"... The martyrs that survived "the Slaughter at the Caves of Chaos". The traditional player races have come and gone, escaping with their lives but not before killing every known member of the player characters' tribe across the known Realm. <br/><br/>Yet our heroes live. <br/>And they are to become legend. <br/><br/>With luck, they will band together with other survivors amidst the carnage of the Caves to go out in an unfamiliar land. A land where the "Villains" live in wooden boxes and feed on fields of tended plants. If only they could seek out others of their race that myth and rumor tell exist far far beyond the ends of the Realm, beyond the misty mountains tops... But to do so they must first make their way from the Caves to gain power, to gain wealth, to gain freedom from the Villains that seek their hide. <br/>For one day the Caves of Chaos will be theirs' again! <br/><br/>I plan to use these old school modules (in the order of their level) to build the campaign.  Swapping the idea of the PCs being "monsters" to make each module "work".  many of Dragon's "Top 20 Modules" of all time...<br/><br/>    T1-4    The Temple of Elemental Evil (1-8)<br/>    Scourge of the Slave Lords  A1-4  (7-11)   <br/>    A1    Slave Pits of the Undercity<br/>    A2    Secret of the Slavers Stockade<br/>    A3    Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords<br/>    A4    In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords<br/>    Against the Giants  G1-3     (8-12)<br/>    G1     Steading of the Hill Giant Chief<br/>    G2     Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl<br/>    G3     Hall of the Fire Giant King<br/>    D1, D2    Descent into the Depths of the Earth (9-14)<br/>    D3     Vault of the Drow (10-14)<br/>    Q1    Queen of the Demonweb Pits (8-14)<br/><br/>These are other classics that I was thinking of "fitting in" to the above Super-Module.

I have a love-hate relationship with the word "campaign," but I don't know what else to call it. "Game," I suppose.<br/><br/>I had five players present and two absent. Present were Brandon and Stephanie, Rachael, Lisa, Jeanette, and I. One of the absent (Kristin) just got a promotion at work and probably will jump into a game here and there as a guest star. The other (Jen) has pneumonia and is recovering at home. I had never met Jeanette before -- she is Stephanie's coworker.<br/><br/>Only two players had any 4e experience, so I ran them through the first encounter of Keep on the Shadowfell with the pre-gen characters. I asked them to pay attention to what all the characters were doing so they had an idea of what they wanted to play. They were impressed with my color tokens, yay. That took about 20 minutes. <br/><br/>I was about to launch into a second encounter (inside the lair) but just stopped and said, "You all get the gist of it, right? Want to jump into setting creation?" They all agreed.<br/><br/>I gave them a hand-out with some ideas on it -- themes, setting elements, categories like "magic level," "mood," and so on. We brainstormed for a couple hours about the campaign, breaking briefly for pizza. The results are documented in <a href="http://adam.legendary.org/transit/index.php/Session_1" rel="nofollow">my notes</a> (I set up a wiki for the setting info and scheduling).<br/><br/>In short, the setting is fantasy Renaissance world, with muzzle loaders, elves, and pretty common natural magic. A rift tore open the world and something came through to steal all the magic from the world. Most of the men went off to fight it and never came back. The world is run by the women. The group wanted a strong astrological component -- the rift was somehow related to some powerful conjunction of planets. The planet was cut off from the feywild by the rift, so the Eladrin are trapped here.<br/><br/>I explicitly asked them if they wanted to make gender an issue, since six out of seven of the players (not including me) were women. Was there some reason in the game that most of these heroes were women? We decided yes. Brandon's character -- the only male in the group -- is a rogue who dodged the draft and is basically a lazy thug.<br/><br/>We spent the rest of the evening making up characters. It was challenging with only one Player's Handbook, but I had printed out all the first level powers on cards and distributed those when they got to power selection, which is the toughest part of character creation. <br/><br/>Brandon created the human rogue I mentioned above. Stephanie created a human ranger. Lisa created an eladrin warlock (with the star pact, which fits with the astrology theme). Rachael created a half-elven warlord. Jeanette created an eladrin wizard. I might have the races switched for Stephanie's and Jeanette's characters.<br/><br/>They will all "meet" (in-character) at the beginning of the first play session. We decided they were all born at the same time as various important astrological events, so they are special and either know it outright or suspect it instinctively. They're all going to arrive at the same location at the same time to witness some kind of astrological event. All of them have done similar research that led them here. (The rogue is geased by the wizards college to do some investigation for them, after getting caught stealing from the college. We pointed out that this is the plot of the D&amp;D movie, and he should be ashamed of himself.)<br/><br/>I've started writing up notes and stuff on the setting, which I call <a href="http://adam.legendary.org/transit" rel="nofollow">Transit</a>. "Transit" suggests a passageway between worlds, astrological events, and the phrase "sic transit gloria mundi" (thus passes the glory of the world).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151026/#Comment_151026" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T10:40:36+00:00" title="June 16, 2008 10:40AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>I'm interested in seeing how removing XPs effects the game.

Even with one book, it wasn't THAT bad.<br/><br/>I made everyone the same step at the same time. We all chose races and classes first. I summarized each choice for them from the book, even telling them what some of the key features were. Then we all did our ability scores (point buy). I had them write down the table (9-18) for points so they each had a copy. I did pass the book around and showed them the table of sample "legal" ability score sets and that sped things up for a few people.<br/><br/>Then I read off the list of feats for the Heroic Tier from that two-page chart. Where they wanted further clarification, I flipped a few pages and read the whole feat entry. They wrote down those that seemed cool and picked their one or three or whatever number they got.<br/><br/>I had printed the first level power cards. They picked the ones they wanted from there, sometimes changing feat selection. <br/><br/>After powers was equipment. I was dreading this but the equipment list is really narrowed down. I walked around the table and did one at a time. They all bought the best armor they were allowed to wear, then picked a melee weapon and a ranged weapon, then skimmed the equipment list. I think everyone bought the 15-gp "adventurer package" which has all the stuff everyone buys anyway. Two or three bought a tent, or candles or torches. The wizard bought an orb. I don't recall anyone buying anything else. That took about 15 minutes total for 5 players. Miraculous.<br/><br/>We spent fifteen minutes filling out the character sheets for combat and saves and crap. I finished up by explaining alignments. I think they're all unaligned. Who knows if that will change.<br/><br/>We spent another hour after that talking about character origins and backgrounds.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with the chargen process was remembering how many of what you got. I had forgotten to tell them which feats or powers they got for free based on race and class, so they had picked certain feats (Ritual Caster, for example) only to learn they got it for free. A couple of them had to adjust after learning their race and class features.<br/><br/>It wasn't nearly as painful as I thought it would be. It would have been faster if there had been more PHBs floating around,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152749/#Comment_152749" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T13:51:00+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  1:51PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, here are my notes from the discussion I had with my friends about the setting they wanted.<br/><br/>* It should be epic in nature.<br/>* The tone should be serious, even dark. Perhaps gothic horror. <br/>* The world should be similar to ours, but with very common magic of a simple, natural sort. <br/>* Lots of Gothic architecture, but with impossibly huge buildings buttressed with magic.<br/>* There are primitive fire-arms.<br/>* A rift in the world let something terrible in. It wants to steal the world's magic.<br/>* The world is in decline. Everything is crumbling now. Civilization is falling apart, too.<br/>* Overall, the world isn't awful or great. It's getting worse, though.<br/>* The gods are distant and aloof, or unreachable. There are dark elder gods, too, and cults that want to revive them.<br/>* Astrology and astronomy are important. There might even be a scientific explanation for the rift.<br/>* Most of the men in the world joined the army and ran off to fight the evil that came through the rift. Men in a certain age range are pretty rare. Women run things now.<br/>* The game will take place in a large city and in the wilderness, split pretty evenly.<br/>* Prophecies are important.<br/>* The feywild was cut off from this world by the rift. The Eladrin here cannot get back home.<br/>* There are no tieflings here.<br/>* Mindless undead are very rare (and unwelcome by the players). Intelligent, unique undead like mummies and vampires are welcome.<br/>* The player characters were born during significant astrological events.<br/>* Requests for deities: <br/>** a pacifist god, perhaps of farming and peace<br/>** a god of commerce, wealth, and sloth -- sacrifice gold to him or lose your forture<br/>** a god of fighting, glory, and warfare (Mars-like)<br/>** a goddess of safety, defense, the heart (Minerva-like?)<br/>** perhaps a set of evil deities that came before the good ones, like the primordial titans in Roman mythology<br/>** perhaps evil deities that are the counterparts of each of the good deities<br/>* Some kind of crime boss<br/>* Some kind of powerful wizard college that funds its important research by manufacturing mundane magic items                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152750/#Comment_152750" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T13:52:04+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  1:52PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From those notes, I came up with the following backstory:<br/><br/><b>The Orrery</b><br/><br/>There is an Orrery that controls the universe. The gods left it in a well-guarded place millions of years ago.<br/><br/>The artifact controls the movements of planets. It takes incredible power to use the device, but a clever person can slow down the movements of planets, stop the earth from spinning, and so on.<br/><br/><br/><b>Ghost Empress</b><br/><br/>Empress Siltania discovered it. It was incomplete. Pieces were missing. She hired questers to recover the missing pieces. They reassembled the orrery and hid it for twenty years.<br/><br/>Siltania had foreseen her husband's death and wanted to use it to skip the day of the murder. Because she did not fully understand the workings of the orrery, she made a mistake. The device skipped the day of the Emperor's murder, but at the cost of her soul. She was left as an immortal ghost. No one -- including the Empress herself -- has realized this yet.<br/><br/>Over the years, she has become increasingly twisted and power-hungry. She appears to be a normal person, but she is undead. She dismisses magical oddities -- such as her inability to be healed -- as a result of the Rift.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Rift</b><br/><br/>When Siltania activated the orrery and skipped a day, she skipped a day for everyone. No one remembers it but her. Astrologers have noticed an anomaly in the movement of the heavens but it all tracks back to the day of the Rift.<br/><br/>The Rift is when the earth tore. There were terrible earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, volcanic eruptions, storms, and fires. Hell broke loose on earth. Elementals of every sort tore through the world, destroying everything in their paths. People called them demons.<br/><br/>The elementals are consuming the world's magic and turning the world into an elemental haven. The power of nature and the elements -- fire, water, air, earth -- are growing stronger, but other kinds of magic are suffering as a result. The wizards of Corlian have noticed this, too. They don't know about the elementals though.<br/><br/>The earth tore in another way, too. Time is off by one day. One day is missing. That breach of natural law has created a bend in the world, opening it to other worlds. The world already had similar connections, such as to the Feywild. The day the Rift opened, the path to the Feywild closed, stranding the eladrin here. The new worlds that opened were darker.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Dorrem</b><br/><br/>From one of these dark worlds came the Dorrem. They are a telepathic hive-mind of giant ants with a special body-grafting ability. They can form new hybrid creatures using parts of themselves and other races. They multiply very quickly this way. When they merge with a new race, they take on some of its personality characteristics.<br/><br/>The Dorrem are obsessed with colonizing new areas. When they came into this world, the first race they encountered were dwarves. The dwarf-dorrem hybrid races include anttaurs, ant-headed dwarves, and other aberrations.<br/><br/>They have begun crafting indescribably huge subterranean hives. To carve the stone, they need steel. To make the steel, they need charcoal. To make the charcoal, they need lots and lots of wood. For this reason, they are clear-cutting forests around their mountain hives. This obviously has created an uproar among the elves and eladrin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152753/#Comment_152753" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T14:00:42+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  2:00PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On top of all that, I have some additional constraints.<br/><br/>1. They want more non-combat encounters than combat encounters. Let's say 2:1, even 3:1.<br/><br/>2. They want to spend about half the time in the city, and half the time in the wild. City can be dangerous though.<br/><br/>3. Game sessions are episodic. We'll tell a complete story in one sitting, from start to end. We may elapse large blocks of time between games and jump 3-5 levels at a time. We'll play for about 8 hours straight, once every 4-6 weeks.<br/><br/>4. The first episode involves the characters showing up at the Rift (and a dismantled Orrery, but they don't know that yet). Most of them won't know anyone else there. They will all be there for different reasons (unknown to me at this time).<br/><br/><br/><b>Help me make this campaign awesome.</b><br/><br/>I think part of the campaign will involve reassembling the Orrery, but they may not care about that, so I am not making it essential. <br/><br/>I am interested in any ideas you have for making the backstory <i>more useful</i>.

Maybe they have to use the Orrery to jump back to that day and play it out the way it should have happened.

Those are useful ideas.<br/><br/>I had thoughts about having the Orrery have some missing parts (giant gems for the planets or something) that had been stolen. The players might have to chase them around the world in a "rod of seven parts" type of scenario. Your idea is cooler, because it isn't just MacGuffin-chasing. They're actually traveling the world to use their astronomical skills that tie into the theme and setting. Really, I can combine my ideas and yours. That sounds like a great 11th level adventure as the characters hop from continent to continent in one evening's play.<br/><br/>I prefer distant gods to meddling ones, because they tend to trump the PCs when they're on stage. Sending agents works for me, though. I think I can use them to create interesting bangs for the characters. I want the players to have real choices.<br/><br/><br/>Zak, <br/><br/>4e might normally do all the heavy lifting of getting a PC from 1st to 30th, but that won't happen in this episodal game. The players and I will be deciding to which level to advance everyone at the end of each episode, without earning even 1 XP. We'll time-lapse and write character backstory to add some juicy bits to what happened in the meantime. <br/><br/>I like inter-party conflict but I don't know if my friends do. I'll bet Brandon loves it, but everyone has to be on board for it, or it won't work. D&amp;D sorta assumes that the PCs will work together and stick together, right down into the core of the design. Maybe we can add a rule to the social contract about inter-party conflict. You know, "PCs can bicker and fight but in the end they must kiss and make up so as not to disrupt 'the party' for the long run." Maybe they'll surprise me and say they love it and that they'll be happy even if the group splits six or seven different ways. I'll just make them play NPCs more often if they split up like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson" title="Zak Arntson"><img alt="Zak Arntson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/147/nVMQWQSYECWCV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson">Zak Arntson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152995/#Comment_152995" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T14:41:32+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  2:41PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, yeah, that's more what I was thinking, too.

What I have planned:<br/><br/>I'm creating planets and moons named after the gods. These are the gods themselves, or their heavenly palaces, or symbols of their power on earth -- depending on whom you ask. <br/><br/>I'm creating a zodiac of constellations named after monsters and heroes in the setting. If Geltalla the Ranger slew Oramor the Dragon, those make good constellations and zodiacal signs. <br/><br/>Each zodiacal sign has personality traits associated with it, the way we associate certain things with Scorpio or Virgo. As a daily power, a character may act out one of those traits and gain a +2 zodiac bonus to any d20 roll. For example, "Like any typical Dragon, I am quick to anger. I freak out at the guard who insulted me and try to intimidate him. I'll use my zodiac +2 bonus for it."<br/><br/>In general, an Arcana check can be used for various skills challenges -- perhaps even retroactively -- if the character claims to have studied the star charts for that day.<br/><br/>I may add rituals like Auspicious Day, in which a character learns of a day and time 2-12 months in the future at which time he can gain a +10 bonus to any single die roll. <br/><br/>Any astrological system I make must be terribly easy to use. No actual charting or complicated math. No figuring out if planets are actually in conjunction or if a moon is going to transit a constellation.

I'm not there yet.<br/><br/>Last night, as my wife and I lay in bed and shared the details of our days with each other, I finally had time to tell her about this campaign. She doesn't usually care about elves and shit. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>She's a speculative fantasy fiction writer. She likes stories. I started telling her about the cool backstory for this campaign, which is essentially a love story. By the time she got through with it, she had the meat for a novel of her own, and she'd vastly improved my story. Here's what we ended up with. I need to make up names and stuff, but you get the idea. <br/><br/>(By the way, plotting D&amp;D campaigns with one's wife in bed is awesome.)<br/><br/><b>The Backstory of the Transit Campaign</b><br/><br/>This is a love story.<br/><br/>The Queen of Corlian, the Dragon Empire, was bright and just, beloved by her people. Her husband, the Prince-Consort, loved her very much, and loved his people, too. The Queen, being a talented astrologer in her own right, foresaw a terrible plot against the prince and sought to prevent it. With the resources and power of a continental empire at her disposal, she discovered an ancient artifact, the Orrery, tuned it to the universe after thousands of years of disrepair, and learned its power. It not only represented the exact locations of the planetary bodies, it could influence how they moved. By forcing the heavenly bodies on the Orrery to move, she could move the heavens. She used the Orrery to skip the day that her husband would be murdered. <br/><br/>One does not simply remove a day from the universe without consequence. The Queen did not consider every possibility. Terrible things occurred as a result. But the good thing first: the Prince-Consort's murder was thwarted, and he and the Queen lived a life full of love. <br/><br/>However, the universe wanted its day back. Timequakes started rocking the world. The astrologers eventually noticed the anomaly in their charts but didn't know which day was missing. Many months after the missing day, a quake tore a Rift in the world and cataclysm fell upon everyone on the planet as elemental destruction rampaged the land. Volcanoes, storms, earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, and tornadoes destroyed cities. Terrible monsters flooded the world and armies of men marched to stop them. Most of the men in the world died over those decades of warfare unlike any seen before. Good men are rare these days.<br/><br/>Also, the Queen split into two distinct beings. The Innocent Queen knows nothing of that fateful day. She lives a happy life with her love. The Witch Queen knows everything about the Orrery and the choices she made, yet she cannot believe she caused all that strife. She is not a bad person. She is just a woman who loved her husband enough to change the world to keep him alive. The destruction cannot be undone and she will not have it be for naught. The Witch Queen is, in a very real way, "a day ahead" of everyone else. She sees things before they happen. She has great understanding now of the universe and is growing in power. She uses this power to keep the world the way it is, to keep her husband alive, to keep people from finding out the truth. The Witch Queen can possess the body of the Innocent Queen (she is the same person, after all) and keep her from learning things. She keeps her in the dark.<br/><br/>The Prince-Consort is not a stupid man, or else the Queen would not have married him. Her equal in intellect and wisdom, the prince has started to figure out that there's day missing from the world and that it is the cause of the Rift and the destruction. He wants to put it all right again, and he'll sacrifice himself to do so -- he loves his people more than he loves his own life -- but he won't have the strength to go through with self-sacrifice if it breaks his wife's heart. He needs to do this without her finding out because if she asks him to stay, he won't be able to leave.<br/><br/>Enter the heroes. Each was born on a day when the planets were aligned in a special way. They know they are special somehow. Each has arrived at the Orrery on a day of great astrological importance to witness an event. Their research and perhaps the stars have brought them together for the first time to ask questions about the world and why it is the way it is. <br/><br/>The Witch Queen is already onto the heroes. She will have them arrested and will accuse them of tampering with the Orrery. Her people will hold a trial and jump to conclusions. Did they cause the Rift? Where is the missing gem-globe on the Orrery? Where is the missing day and how did they accomplish it?<br/><br/>The Prince-Consort will help them, but only in secret. He dares not go against his Queen openly and he doesn't want her to know he is plotting his own suicide. He will have his people free the heroes and feed them information to start them on the quest he cannot take himself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153156/#Comment_153156" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T11:33:11+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 11:33AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff.
