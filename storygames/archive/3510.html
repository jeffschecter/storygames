Some of the answers were a little surprising. Those that said no were concerned that it trampled on some cultural issues.<br/><br/>I had a few comments but didn't want to further muddy the topic at hand with them so I figured I would talk about them here.<br/><br/>It was stated by several posts that a) the author should "know what they are talking about" and b) should probably be from the culture in question.<br/><br/>To this I have three things to comment:<br/>1)  Tim had a pretty darn good point in that no one here was raised in the culture in question (mythic india).  I could see if there was a specific point in a cultures history that was getting misrepresented (like Fuedal Japan) but were talking about taking elements with an indian asthetic and making an action game out of them.  <br/><br/>2)  So how would you know what culture someone is from before you read it?  How do you know Tim's mom isn't Indian or his indian parents didn't adopt him?  If someone were to have an indian affectation and change their name to reflect some bogus indian heritage would we assume his version of mythic india (read without knowing the author) was more accurate than Tim's.  What of someone who is third or fourth generation indian and raised in a completely westernized manner.  Would we assume they were knowledgeable on the subject?  I think Tim has a point when he suggested that before raising this sort of concern, doesn't it make more sense to see the treatment first.  Or maybe ask "hey, I know a little something about the genre do you mind me seeing it before it goes to the public to avoid some glaring cultural ideosyncracy or hurtful stereotype."  I wouldn't say no.<br/><br/>3)  On accuracy.  I watched a Pakistani horror film called Hell's Ground.  Afterward the director and creator said a few words.  There were certainly several people from his general culture in the theater.  Someone asked "is there a reason you portrayed the kids (read victims) in the movie in such a westernized fashion?"  And he answered "because that's how they act and dress."   There are often similarities where we do not expect and interesting details we'd like to explore.  If done to avoid really racially insensitive material I don't really see any harm in making something exciting and fanciful out of it.  After all it's their perception of the material and really no right and wrong.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79162/#Comment_79162" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T16:00:53+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  4:00PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2007 4:16PM by Josh Roby.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<em>post removed to avoid stupid endless flamewars where nobody's mind will change</em> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79165/#Comment_79165" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T16:04:35+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  4:04PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey man, it sounds like your questions/points are directed specifically towards Shreyas.

Mythic India is not a magical separate entity from Actual India.

It's cultural appropriation when you represent the product as somehow "authentic" and as a representation of the culture in question. If you're (as an outsider) saying "here is my <i>response</i> to my (outsider) <i>perception</i>" and presenting it as that... well, you're still in some deep waters, but I wouldn't call it appropriation. One thing we have to have clear in any discussion along these lines is that there is no "there" there - no true, authentic, authorized version - only interpretations which are all broken in various ways. The colonized's perceptions of their cultural heritage are messed up by colonization as much or more so as the colonizer's. (Which totally does NOT remove the obligation to give them primacy of respect).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79185/#Comment_79185" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T21:25:35+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  9:25PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<em>The Mountain Witch</em> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79188/#Comment_79188" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T22:36:18+00:00" title="July  2, 2007 10:36PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think the whole argument, on both sides, is ridiculous. People who are not part of a culture can't argue that they have some kind of right to write about a culture, nor can people from that culture forbid outsiders from writing about their culture, especially when they themselves write about other cultures they don't belong to. That, right there, is a <em>real</em> false dichotomy between Self and Other. I reject it, and say it doesn't apply.</p>\n<p>Artists and other creative producers (which, presumably, includes game designers) take their experiences and express their thoughts and feelings about them, to communicate their viewpoint to other people. These experiences include cultural heritage, other cultures they've been directly exposed to, indirect exposure through the works of other artists, and fleeting fragments that may have echoes of some other culture, but no one remembers or recognizes the connection (there's more of the last than you think, because cultures are not neat little boxes, but interpenetrating, fluid concepts.)</p>\n<p>But what an artist creates is not something about a culture, it's something about <em>the artist</em>. It's a message, from me to you. Art is, ultimately, appropriation -- of everything the artist is exposed to. It was always this way, in every culture, in every time period. Artists are thieves, and proud of it.</p>\n<p>Now, an artist's message may be offensive to someone. If that offended person has an opportunity to say to the artist, "I am offended by what you said, and here is why..." the artist may hear the objections and change the message in some way... or the artist may decide the message is fine as it is, and say "thank you for expressing your concerns." And if the offended person doesn't like that response, there's always the possibility of answering art with art, in the form of a review, or an essay, or a creative work that answers the offending one. People can tell other people how offensive that work of art is, and if the other people agree, they won't listen to that artist.</p>\n<p>But dammit, people, be <em>honest</em> and <em>own your opinions</em>. Don't pretend an artist has broken some kind of moral code or gone against objective reality in some way. Your response to an artist, however brief, is itself art.

(see Sambo imagery in Japan for one)<br/><br/>Lately folks have been asking women and male ally feminists if things in their games are problematic.  This is cool- if you don't know, check with someone who does.  But when it comes to race*, more than once I've encountered folks who actually are trying to write something true to source, and seem clueless about authenticity.<br/><br/>And I remind them they can check in with the group they're writing about.  The internet makes it easy.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, it's never occurred to them, because the default assumption is that the best way to check for authenticity is to either look at museums or read books written by other white folks.<br/><br/>But you know, you can write whatever you want for a game.  Just understand when you portray people as weird strange or silly things, and never as people, and <i>that's ALL they see of themselves in media</i>, maybe it's not so entertaining to them.  And isn't that great- you made something for your entertainment at their expense.  Funfunfun!<br/><br/>*edit: and the reason I say race, and not culture here, is that white folks do have balancing images, whereas people of color do not.  That and if you were inaccurate as a poc describing a white culture, no one would freak out about you getting checked on your innaccuracy- that would be fair criticism...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/charlequin" title="charlequin"><img alt="charlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/charlequin">charlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79261/#Comment_79261" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T08:30:43+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  8:30AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 8:31AM by charlequin.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm kind of irritated that this thread produced some wildly defensive "don't tell me what I can talk about!" responses. <br/><br/>Art isn't some sort of <i>carte blanche</i> protection against consideration of the repercussions of your decisions. When someone has an important point to make, yes, sometimes it's going to offend people, and yet it's still important for the artist to express themselves -- but let's be honest. "D&amp;D, but with maces and snake goddesses!" is not an important artistic statement whose inherent value overrides all consideration of others.<br/><br/>The idea that anyone and everyone's culture is in open season -- that as a Western person it's one's inherent right to play around with, reinvent, and even misinterpret the history and mythology of other people -- is exactly what the people in the other thread were raising as a concern. <br/><br/>A standard like "nothing an American ever writes about Asia is ever acceptable" isn't going to get anywhere, but there needs to be some give on both sides -- if you want to write about a culture that isn't your own, you really do have a much higher burden of responsibility than writing things you know firsthand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79264/#Comment_79264" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T08:47:51+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  8:47AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Chris said.

No matter how really clever and brilliant it might be. If you have ANY concern - and you ought to take due diligence to discover areas of concern - that you're misusing something that somebody else cares about or taking advantage of your privilege to declare "what X is", check yourself.<br/><br/>On the other hand...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: charlequin</cite>The idea that anyone and everyone's culture is in open season -- that as a Western person it's one's inherent right to play around with, reinvent, and even misinterpret the history and mythology of other people -- is exactly what the people in the other thread were raising as a concern.</blockquote>\nIf you take out the goofy stuff about "inherent right" and the notion of Western people having some special and different position with regard to this, "play around with, reinvent, and even misinterpreting" symbols is <b>what people do</b>. It is one of the fundamental acts of being human. The trick is always how to do it in community, and in ways that are respectful. To pretend that "culture" is a thing-in-itself that can be fixed and bounded and owned by anyone, at any time and place, is to make an idol out of it. My culture is mine. Now, here. It is not my ancestors. It is not my neighbors. It is not any else's, and it will change as I change, as I collide with the world outside my skin.

Recontextualization, collaging, reinvention -- this is at the core of great art and humanity's pretty remarkable ability to understand and invent new things.<br/><br/>I do think that feeling <i>entitled</i> to do it is problematic because it implicitly disregards the responsibility involved. When anyone creates art, they're responsible for what that art does out in the world. If they use symbols they've plucked from somewhere else without consideration, and the result is to foster misunderstanding or prejudice -- "I was just being an artist!" isn't a great defense, in my eyes.<br/><br/>"You should do everything within your reasonable ability to gain second- and first-hand knowledge of a real-world culture before you publish something about it" seems like a pretty fair starting standard to hold people to. <br/><br/>I think we actually agree here, Mark, by and large? The deeper you dig into this issue the more fiddly and difficult it gets, but I mostly am interested in establishing respect as a baseline standard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79272/#Comment_79272" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T09:18:31+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  9:18AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 9:19AM by J_Walton.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the follow-up thread was supposed to be about how various games dealt with ethnicity and culture, and I was trying to prepare myself to talk about my conflicted feelings about <i>1001 Nights</i> (though I kinda think I'd rather talk to Meg first before posting).<br/><br/>This issue comes up all the time in anthropology.  An outside researcher gets closely involved with another culture, lives with them, works with them, eats with them, plays with their children, learns their language, listens to their stories, etc.  And then the researcher goes back to his home and writes about everything he's learned and publishes it for the whole world to see.  But this kind of thing has real world consequences.<br/><br/>For indigenous peoples, anthropological studies can be used as tools in conflicts with the US government (or other governments) over issues of sovereignty and land rights.  They can be used to justify new policies by the Department of Indian Affairs or similar governing bureaus.  Additionally, suppose the anthropologist, as a guest of his hosts, was allowed to experience certain rituals or other cultural artifacts that are normally closed to outsiders or even to large segments of their own people.  What if they, say, take part in a sweat lodge reserved only for adult male members of the community and then publish all the details for everyone in the world to read.  The community that welcomed the anthropologist to live and learn with them might now feel betrayed, used, and violated.<br/><br/>The same thing happens in other kinds of academic studies.  Take the research on Chinese religion that I have been doing and will continue to do over the next few years.  Many Chinese religious groups are not legally recognized and have no protection under Chinese law.  Additionally, law enforcement in China is often so arbitrary that people can be detained for months or years at a time with no charges (like Guantanamo).  If I published certain details about research I was conducting, talking about dubiously legal things that certain groups were doing (things that were critical to understanding what was going on in contemporary Chinese religion), I could conceivably ruin people's lives.  This happened recently with a NYTimes reporter, who interviewed some Chinese sectarian Christians and then wrote an article that was accused of making Americans less sympathetic to his interviewees, since he emphasized the heretical nature of their beliefs.  Many of the people he interviewed risked arrests, beatings, torture, and death (for them and for their entire families/communities) to talk to him and felt that he hurt their cause rather than helping it.<br/><br/>Granted, consequences this extreme are not likely to befall those working in roleplaying, though game designers could conceivably conduct fieldwork among indigenous peoples in preparation for writing a game or, alternately, I could choose to write a game about Chinese sectarianism.  However, Chris has a powerful point when he suggests that spreading stereotypes and other disrespectful or blatantly inaccurate portrayals of other cultures can be actively harmful.  It creates an environment that says that other people are not welcome in roleplaying because we do no respect them or their background.  It helps perpetuate ignorance and bigotry.<br/><br/>Human beings, I think, like to assume that everyone else is living in conditions more or less like themselves.  The language may be different, the culture may be different, people's race and ethnicity may be different, but ultimately we all have to go to work and buy groceries and poop and all that stuff.  And when I think about my life, it's hard to imagine how someone else could portray my life and my heritage in a roleplaying game in a way that would really make things worse for me on a day-to-day basis.  I can imagine a portrayal that might annoy me a bit, but it wouldn't anything too bad.  However, I am a white American male.  There are other people who are in very different situations, where the portrayal of women or people of their race/ethnicity in a game could make their life, on a day-to-day basis, suck significantly more.<br/><br/>Say I'm a Chinese D&amp;D fan and on a D&amp;D mailing list and OMG! Oriental Adventures comes out and the people on the mailing list are going off about samurai swords and ninja and kung fu wankery and fortune cookies and all that bullshit.  And it gets rubbed in your face every day.  You could choose to leave the mailing list, right, and be totally excluded and driven off from this hobby that you love.  You could try to object to some of the characterizations people are making, but then you are forced to have conversations like <i>the one in this thread</i> over and over again, without much improvement of the situation.  Every day you have to struggle to just get a fair hearing and not to be ridiculed.  No good choices.<br/><br/>It's nice to think of the artist, the game designer, as someone who is working with these abstract Platonic concepts that are divorced from the real world.  That they are some kind of supreme flower arranger who just has to worry about putting the right selection of elements together in a way that makes something awesome and beautiful.  But that's not how it is.  Artists make things out of the components of real people's experiences and their work can have an effect on people's daily lives in a real way.  Roleplaying may not be responsible for things on the scale of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, which change the world in big observable ways, but a game that you create could certainly make other people's lives totally suck.  And I think that's something worth considering and worth taking responsibility for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79276/#Comment_79276" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T09:30:21+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  9:30AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 10:04AM by J_Walton.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas <a href="http://www.i-would-knife-fight-a-man.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=1621&amp;page=1#Item_35" rel="nofollow">just put it</a> more eloquently than I ever would have:\n<blockquote>When you write about a subject, you endanger it.

Unless you know the guy personally it would be difficult in a forum such as this to tell what someone's background is (a point no one seemed to answer appropriately).  If I were to write a game about American slavery and the underground railroad folks of the current mindset might say "that's not a good idea because you have no idea what your talking about and it could be insulting."  Even those who have met me might wince.  But I believe my degree in African American culture and race relations puts me in a pretty darn good position to speak about such things.

The defining feature of intellectual property is that giving it away doesn't deprive me of access to it (though it may of course prevent me from what the economists I think call accruing rent from it). Lumping physical and cultural appropriation together ignores the syncretic quality of culture: when you gaze into someone else's abyss, it gazes back at you.<br/><br/>I wonder if the unspoken point of division in this debate is around power (cultural or otherwise): at some point, does "cultural appropriation" become "bricolage"? And is that point the one at which we imagine the artist not to be some kind of sociocultural demiurge but instead a tiny point of articulation for all the various cultural influences and social forces that act on and through him or her?<br/><br/>None of that, of course, frees the artist -- or writer of games! -- from an obligation to respond to the interests of cultural stakeholders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79321/#Comment_79321" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T11:26:04+00:00" title="July  3, 2007 11:26AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, would you apply this principle to non-ethnic identities as well?

I'm not arguing that stereotyping does not occur and should not be denounced when seen. Judging Shakespeare on the basis of the images he used in his artistic expression is fair game. As a Jew (a Jewish banker no less), the Shylock character is particularly offensive to me. But, the fact that he had a Jew in his play was not offensive. It was the way he did it.<br/><br/>My point is that authors of works of fiction have the entire world open as subject matter from which to draw inspiration. I reserve the right to challenge them on what they do with their subjects, but not the right to declare subjects off-limits to them based on their race, creed or color.<br/><br/>I will agree with Shreyas' post that you have to recognize the power and responsibility you have as an artist. But, you are judged by what you do with, and to, your subject, not by the color of your skin or your religious beliefs, or those of your parents.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's how I see stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79331/#Comment_79331" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T11:53:21+00:00" title="July  3, 2007 11:53AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 11:57AM by Josh Roby.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, if you're an OG Transformers fan, other people liking Camaro Bumblebee does not diminish your experience of OG Transformers.<br/><br/>If you signed away your rights to publish material that you created, well, <em>don't sign stupid contracts</em>.<br/><br/>If you want to write a realistic game of Shaolin monks, dude, go right ahead.

I don't believe in groups of people. I only believe in individuals.</p>\n<p>I have no objection to what Chris and Jonathan say about considering the repercussions of your actions, except for the part about obligation. There is no obligation for an artist to do anything. However, if you are claiming your art as an authentic representation of a culture and you don't take the steps Chris and Jonathan describe, you wind up looking pretty foolish.</p>\n<p>But then, as you can probably tell from the games I have chosen to concentrate on, I'm not interested in cataloging other cultures. Creating a catalog of another culture as a game artifact seems like bad art to me, because it doesn't delve into what the artist sees as the core experience of that culture. After watching, reading and listening to many '40s and '50s-style retro-SF space patrol stories, I have gained an impression of what a retro-SF space patrol story is <em>about</em>: stuff about heroes with very blunt, simple a moral code of conduct tossed into rapidly-shifting conflicts, and the latter not having much of an overall rationale, but being driven more by dramatic necessity. I am taking this internalized experience and developing it into a game. I could just as well take experiences of some culture in the traditional sense, sum up what I perceive as the essential nature of that culture, and comment on that.</p>\n<p>Other artists have done this. Take, for example, the fictional culture of Rolisica described in the film Mothra (1961), which I'm using because I recently saw it again. Rolisica is an amalgam of the U.S. and U.S.S.R, reduced to a stereotype of a greedy, pushy culture trampling on human rights. You could look at this and say "Oh, the Japanese have done it, too, so that makes it OK for Americans to stereotype other cultures, too." But that's not what I'm saying. Or you could argue that stereotypes like this have harmed America, but that's nonsense, too. This isn't about what "the Japanese" (as some kind of multi-limbed monstrosity) has done to another multi-limbed monstrosity, nor is it about imaginary "cultural harm". It's about one artist, the screenwriter, making a statement about his personal experiences, what he thinks about the world around him. He is under no obligation to alter his expression to match the expectations of an audience; he does what he wants to do, in response to his feelings and opinions. And no group is hurt by anything he says, although individuals may feel offended, or maybe just regard it as a clumsy portrayal or bad art. And these individuals may respond themselves, as artists, telling others how they felt when they saw that portrayal of something they identified with.</p>\n<p>You could bring up all manner of other issues about this, like the differential of power between post-war Japan and the U.S., or the fact that one negative portrayal of U.S. culture would be washed out in a tide of positive portrayals produced by Hollywood. But all of those objections are garbage, because it's still talking about groups, not individuals. "Hollywood" doesn't exist, individual actors, writers, and directors exist. Cultures aren't oppressed or colonized, individual people feel oppressed or colonized. Thinking in terms of groups dehumanizes people. Maybe it's just easier for me to see this, because I'm not a member of a group, I'm a person of mixed heritage living on the fringes of mainstream America. To me, people saying mean things about white Americans isn't oppressive; people talking in terms of groups is oppressive. And I am not an offended group, I am an offended individual, and I speak out in opposition to this group-think.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79349/#Comment_79349" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T13:01:53+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  1:01PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Transformers thing was a metaphor and a bad one at that, so let's drop it, no?

As gender roles are traditionally defined, a man has access to a wide variety of roles while a woman is relegated to the position of caregiver; a white person in America is seen as being able to fill almost any role, while an immigrant is likely to be seen as having a social role based on their ethnicity. A person who belongs to a marginalized category can speak with authority about effects upon their group because they are seen and judged within society based solely on the appearance of association with said group.<br/><br/>The unique lone artist is a nice idea, but it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Any piece of artistic work that portrays people in non-privileged groups in a way that emphasizes stereotypes or oppressive views, and isn't counteracted by a similarly "legitimate" piece that debunks those stereotypes, will actually have a real effect of increasing the belief in those stereotypes -- because that's a factual quality of the way media sources shape culture and perception. I'm not really interested in seeing that ignored in favor of a blanket principle about artistic integrity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79358/#Comment_79358" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T13:52:25+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  1:52PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 2:36PM by Andy.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><a href="http://seamonkey.ed.asu.edu/~mcisaac/emc598ge/Unpacking.html" rel="nofollow">"I was taught to see racism only in individual acts of meanness, not in invisible systems conferring dominance on my group"</a>-- which Matt Wilson linked me to a while back.</blockquote>\nThat's a really hot link, Jonathan. Thanks for posting that.<br/><br/>1) I'm hoping that, well at least here anyway, we can foster a culture where someone can aim for writing or creating works about another culture. ("I want to write an Africa RPG! Fierce animals, multilingual PCs, fictive kinship and spellcasting griots!")<br/>2) That author can be challenged by the community ("You want to write an "Africa" RPG? What <i>exactly</i> do you mean by that? Also, did you do any research?"). <br/>3) They can find support and perhaps direction from the community ("If you're writing about West Africa, you'll want to see Reference X, Y, Z, and also talk to the following communities with your ideas: A, B and C. I'll help introduce you to them.")<br/>4) Then, if they pull off their creation, and it's cool (well thought out, respectful, and fun), then they get props.<br/>5) If the creation is decidedly not cool (especially given the above), they can be savagely ("Graham style") criticized. Being helpful with criticism at this stage is *nice*, but at that point if it looks like the author was just being a doofus, or doing the kewlness cultural imperialism thing, then a simple righteous ass-kicking is satisfactory as well.<br/>EDIT: 6) If you receive criticism and challenges all along the way, and dismiss them with "<i>Art</i> doesn't have to answer to anyone!", then don't be surprised if we jump straight to Step 5 on you.<br/><br/>But in the above, as a participant here, I'd prefer to see that Step <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> be a challenge, and not just a lockdown or smug dismissal. Jonathan's post about how he remains skeptical of Chinese scholars is pretty much spot on with how I feel about Japanese social scholars... And yet, I'm asking for people to muster enough trust deep down to ask those questions and challenge the author in Step <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> (hey, if you must then ask <i>harsh</i> questions, or challenge them <i>severely</i>), rather than just dismiss the effort outright. If they're posting here, then more likely than not they are <i>with the program</i>.<br/><br/>Are those steps 1-5 above fair? Do people think they might be able to live with them here?<br/><br/>Side Note:<br/>Tim mentioned chariot races and arrows, "kill them and take away their wickedness". I blew past that because I felt it was just a statement of geeky enthusiasm, and not as a glimpse of the final product (I was withholding my judgment until I saw more about it), but I can totally see, and agree with, how that could set someone off (how are we to know if that's the author's final goal, or just a statement of geeky enthusiasm*). Still, I say, here I'd like people to please ask questions. Challenge the author.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* When I was working on Tenra Bansho at first and talking about it, my enthusiasm took over. Instead of "theatrical-style roleplay", "relationship and motive-driven characters", I was jumping around singing "Awesome ninjas! Awesome gem-studded emo Hulk-samurai! Awesome Buddhism!

In my mind, the problem of misrepresentation isn't in the people who are offended -- it's the people who are not offended.  For example, the problem with <i>Birth of a Nation</i> wasn't solely that black people who watched it were offended and hurt.  The problem was that many white people watched it and were <i>not</i> offended, and in fact it drove membership in the Klu Klux Klan.  KKK recruiters would show the film before signing people up.  <br/><br/>I believe the artist can and should do what he wants to.  However, critics of him should also be free to judge him on this basis.  <br/><br/>Art has a social influence.  While ideally for some people, art might just be pure aesthetics -- in reality people's worldviews are often based on art.  Most people's view of many topics distant from them -- like war or fascism -- comes more from movies and novels than textbooks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79364/#Comment_79364" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T14:12:28+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  2:12PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 2:27PM by Andy.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JBR: Not sure what you're trying to say there?<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure Chris is referring to the phenomena of:<br/><br/>White dudes wanting to play awesome black Haitian voodoo badasses...<br/><br/>...But without having to muddy things up by learning anything about voodoo, Haiti, or black people.

But looking at it closely, I think you can see a difference between the way teachers treat students as a group, for example, and the way we're discussing cultures as groups. Students form a temporary group, by virtue of what they do; they are not always "students", but are sometimes filling other roles. And, even when they are a group, they are still individuals. Teachers have to take into account that, when teaching a given subject, some of their students may already know that subject, others may pick it up quickly or read ahead, and others may need more time. Teachers have to balance the needs of the individuals, to ensure that the advanced students are challenged and not bored, but that the other students have the proper attention needed to learn. And the same principle applies to the other areas as well. And also to cultures, which aren't monolithic stereotypes, but amalgamations of individuals with varied experiences, in different contexts. There are people of mixed heritage, people who are mistaken for other ethnic groups, people living in enclaves with slightly different views (positive or negative) towards their culture than the mainstream's views, people who reject some or all of their culture, or incorporate elements of another culture into their own... each person is an individual with unique experiences, which change as they move form place to place or interact in different ways.</p>\n<p>Talking about culture, race, or other such groups makes sense when you are only talking about overall trends. Like, when discussing government, corporations, or other institutions. But when you argue from the general to the specific, I have a problem with that. It leads to mistakes like Joshua's statement: "Any piece of artistic work that portrays people in non-privileged groups in a way that emphasizes stereotypes or oppressive views, and isn't counteracted by a similarly "legitimate" piece that debunks those stereotypes, will actually have a real effect of increasing the belief in those stereotypes -- because that's a factual quality of the way media sources shape culture and perception." That's obviously false, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it treats all artistic acts as having equal relevance, when in reality some works of art are ignored, criticized, or openly reviled;</li>\n<li>it treats the content of artistic acts as disconnected from their message;</li>\n<li>it ignores the on-going artistic dialog, in which artists <em>have been debunking</em> those stereotypes, all along;</li>\n<li>it treats the audience as a unified mass, controlled by mass media, as opposed to an amalgamation of individuals with different reactions;</li>\n<li>it treats those affected by stereotypes as a unified mass, facing identical effects and reacting in identical ways.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've said already that, if people are offended by something, they should say "I am offended by that, and here's why". My hardcore rejection of groups and devotion to individuals means that I am entirely in favor of individual people explain how they were offended by individual acts. But <em>I</em> am offended by people pretending to speak for a group about hypothetical acts based on hypothetical offenses. Andy has a point: rather than attacking someone for something they haven't even done yet (and, worse, pretending it's not you doing the attacking, but some impersonal moral force,) people should respond to actual actions. If you have concerns about an unfinished project, at least phrase your concerns in terms of your past experiences ("I was offended when I saw X, and don't want to see that repeated.")</p>\n<p>(Because of the cross-posting, I'll just add that I agree with John Kim. Especially the part about people criticizing a work of art. It's that very process that explains why <em>Birth of a Nation</em> isn't respected today, and in fact why Griffith felt a need to respond to critics of the movie with another movie, <em>Intolerance</em>, which I understand wasn't a very good response to the critics.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79376/#Comment_79376" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T14:42:54+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  2:42PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 2:44PM by Andy.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim Gray</cite><br/>I see.

I am sure Chris is an authority on the cultures he participates in.  Outside of a time machine, I don't think he's a participant in historical Chinese cultures.<br/><br/>(Cause, tangent and all, saying 'China' and thinking that it's one monolithic culture is kind of, well, stupid.)<br/><br/>If I was going to write a game about Chinese-Americans, I'd totally shoot Chris an email.  If I was going to do some game involving Canada, I'd totally talk to Mo.  They're certainly participants in those cultures, and I would no doubt find their perspectives helpful.<br/><br/>However, there's a difference between a participant and an authority.  It's quite possible to be a participant in something and not be an authority.  If Mo was all jingoistic about Canada being the bestest place in the whole wide world and morally superior to any other nation, her perceptions of the culture that she participates in on a daily basis may not be the only perspective I need in order to get a good, well-rounded picture of Canada.  For that I might go to somebody with a different perspective -- somebody who's an almost-participant-sort-of-guest (like, say, Brand), or somebody who hasn't lived in Canada but has studied them -- whoever mans the Canada desk at the CIA, to use an excessive example.<br/><br/>And lastly, yeah, the current participants are most likely to be affected by whatever I publish, and I might approach them if I thought my product was going to be big enough to actually affect them.  But if I did talk with them, I would be approaching them in a <em>very</em> different way than if I sought them out as factual authorities.  The question would not be, "Is this correct?"  The question would be, "Is this potentially dangerous?"  Not everything that I could publish that is dangerous is necessarily incorrect; not everything that is incorrect is potentially dangerous.<br/><br/>And here's the big point: if a participant says I got something wrong, I might still publish it.  If an authority says I got something wrong, I might still publish it.  If someone who might be affected said I had something potentially dangerous, I might still publish it.  None of these folks have veto power over my publishing, and in some cases I might be publishing something <em>specifically because</em> it might cause some change that somebody in the world may disapprove of.<br/><br/>Now, I should certainly consult most or all of these people before I publish, to the best of my ability as a small-press publisher.  I shouldn't publish blindly.  But I don't think anyone on this board is suggesting that publishing blindly is a good idea, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/charlequin" title="charlequin"><img alt="charlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/charlequin">charlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79382/#Comment_79382" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T15:11:53+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  3:11PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 3:12PM by charlequin.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>it treats all artistic acts as having equal relevance, when in reality some works of art are ignored, criticized, or openly reviled;it treats the content of artistic acts as disconnected from their message;it ignores the on-going artistic dialog, in which artists<em>have been debunking</em>those stereotypes, all along;it treats the audience as a unified mass, controlled by mass media, as opposed to an amalgamation of individuals with different reactions;it treats those affected by stereotypes as a unified mass, facing identical effects and reacting in identical ways.</blockquote>\nI agree that my sentence doesn't really account for the size of the audience or overall level of respect a given work has, but I strongly disagree with the claim that broad effects aren't relevant because the way they actually manifest is in the reactions of individuals. I don't deny this, or the idea that individuals can critically examine and reject messages provided by media sources.<br/><br/>However, the effects that are being criticized here manifest in the form of broad trends. As Chris brought up recently (somewhere? I guess not in this thread), the film <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjy9q8VekmE" rel="nofollow">A Girl Like Me</a> examines the cultural effects of cultural depiction on black American women. Media isn't the sole source of the stereotypes and cultural forces that create those problems, but it's definitely central to their propagation -- because individual people see and read and hear stories that are supposed to only be about individuals, but (subconsciously or not) transform them into generalizations about categories of people. This disjoint relationship between individuals (who aren't controlled by media) and broad trends (which can often be related directly to media, communications, and specific cultural events) is how advertising and propaganda and oppression all function -- any given person might choose from a wide variety of possible responses, but (when successful) they create a social trend in a certain direction.<br/><br/>I also think it's inaccurate to say that artistic criticism drove the disapproval of things like <i>Birth of a Nation</i>. That film is seen disapprovingly because societal attitudes towards race have changed, not because it was seen at the time as being "bad." It, and many other works of art that supported viewpoints that seem ghastly today, was widely supported and did a great deal to strengthen the ideals it represented at the time it was made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79383/#Comment_79383" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T15:18:11+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  3:18PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, I agree with most of what you wrote, though I'm kinda annoyed that you seem to be waving the "no censorship" flag.  I don't think anyone's talking about veto power or anything like this, just taking responsibility for your creative works.<br/><br/>I also worry about assuming that you can determine what is and isn't potentially dangerous about your work without asking anyone.  Clearly, people from different backgrounds are going to experience the same work differently and authors especially are often blind to issues or flaws within their own creations.<br/><br/>Additionally, I honestly don't see how you can separate out "saying something about Chinese people during the Han Dynasty" from "saying something about 21st century Chinese-Americans."  When a 21st century American makes a piece of art about Chinese people, their audience will relate it to the Chinese people they see around them every day, even when you're really talking about their ancestors.  That's just the reality.  And people will assume all of China is one big monolithic thing unless you demonstrate to them otherwise, stupid or not.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you should assume your audience is a bunch of bigoted morons, but you shouldn't assume that they lack very common misconceptions and stereotypes.  Most of us have more than a few of those rattling around upstairs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79385/#Comment_79385" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T15:41:07+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  3:41PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I'm not trying to gauge potential danger on my own; I'm saying I'm deciding what potential danger is acceptable.  There are simple cases such as what we're talking about here and not presenting populations of people as simple caricatures.  There are far more complicated cases such as the <em>World of Animals</em> reader that I'm editing right now, which has me doing a tightrope walk on how much evolution I can get away with including -- because part of my intent here is very much to publish something dangerous to the Intelligent Design circles of the Rabid Right culture.  And I'm saying: the simple case and the complicated case are two examples of the same kind of decision.  Much like how Vincent showed <em>Dogs</em> to his family, knowing and intending the game to be a criticism of religion in general and LDS in specific.  If you're publishing something and it's not 'dangerous' to <em>somebody</em>, one wonders why you're going to the trouble of publishing it.<br/><br/>As to the second point, you're conflating two very different things:<br/>1) Consulting Chinese-Americans on the <em>effects</em> of a publication about Han Dynasty Chinese: yes, totally right there with you, on board.<br/>2) Consulting Chinese-Americans on the <em>accuracy</em> of a publication about Han Dynasty Chinese: not a necessary step, assuming there's some check on the accuracy by some sort of authority on Han Dynasty Chinese, who may or may not be of Chinese heritage himself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79392/#Comment_79392" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T16:23:29+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  4:23PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 4:39PM by noclue.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited away as an annoying comment that probably amused only me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79394/#Comment_79394" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T16:27:02+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  4:27PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I'm conflating those things, Josh.

group can feel oppressed, but I really feel it's a false distinction between 90% of this group feels this way vs. the right to say, "This group feels this way".   We look at things historically and can call out trends ("1800's England was a sexist place") without magicallly losing the ability to recognize that there exists exceptions to that trend.  The fact that all these individuals may have played a part is not a useful way to look at, analyze, nor deal with it as a whole, especially when we're talking about social behaviors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79408/#Comment_79408" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T17:15:13+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  5:15PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs, though, was written from the standpoint of someone who is an insider, culturally, or at least who was able to communicate the insider's point of view (by virtue of having lived it).<br/><br/>I've gone through this kind of thing myself, with regards to <b>Bone White, Blood Red</b>, which is an outsider's view of the world of the Pueblo Revolt, which specifically tries to evoke an insider's mindset from the POV of the Pueblo peoples of New Mexico.<br/><br/>Does it succeed in this? I'm not sure yet, especially as the game itself is still going through some evolution and editing. I've identified a few people to speak to who are Pueblo peoples, but haven't contacted them yet. (There are tribal politics to be considered, something that I've become aware of through a few years of studying the subject.)<br/><br/>I did get in a very public and loud argument with a friend who said that the very act of making a roleplaying game about another culture was a racist deed of cultural imperialism; he seemed to be a living embodiment of the strawmen that some (such as Joshua) are providing, which sadly means that they're not all straw. It seems to be a minority view, however, even among people of color -- most of whom would agree with what Shreyas wrote:\n<blockquote>When you write about <i>something else</i>, then to earn that trust, you have to assertively demonstrate that you are aware of the danger inherent in your expression, and you've taken appropriate and complete measures to protect your subject.</blockquote>\nYou <em>do</em> need to take measures to protect your subject. As Andy suggests above, you should expect to be challenged, and to provide an accounting for what you've done to make sure that you're not being unfair or ignorant, and unintentionally contributing to a pattern of cultural harm.<br/><br/>That's different than "only make games about your own culture, white boy."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79409/#Comment_79409" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T17:28:44+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  5:28PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua,<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm not arguing for magic DNA based cultural authority, I'm saying go talk to the people who are involved in that group/culture.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of examples like:<br/>- A yoga retreat in India, where Indians cannot participate (not only by cost, but by rule)  It's "authentic" but "safe" (from the scary authentic people)<br/>- Yoshi's, a famous jazz club here in Oakland, where they released a "best of" CD and did not include a single black jazz artist<br/>- "Hiphop parties" at college campuses where everyone decides to "dress hiphop" and never invite anyone who actually does participate in the hiphop scene or community<br/><br/>My particular frustration with roleplaying games in particular is that the same publishers who I'll see research arcanities such as 13th century French economics will then turn around and make "Voodoo Vampires!", etc.  I have to ask, why was it so important to research one thing and so hard to get in contact with a living community in another?<br/><br/>It's completely fair to say I'm not an authority on Chinese culture (because I'm not), but I can say I'm getting to be an authority on American stereotypes.

There's no reason for Indians to be excluded from, I dunno, a billiards workshop. The fact that it's yoga seems irrelevant to me. Similarly, to deliberately ignore all white contributions to jazz would be racist, but if you were putting a CD together, it would be hard to say whether it was deliberate. The greater contribution of black artists to jazz just makes the racism obvious. I'm with JBR on the last one. It's just dressing up. <br/><br/>My 2c is that whatever you produce on any subject is your reaction to it, and should be read as such. Often it says more about you than about the subject. I agree that artists have a responsibility to think about how their work will effect the world. But if I create something about my reaction to Han dynasty China, and people take that as a reflection on modern-day people living in London, it seems to me that the reason is that they are racists who lump all "Chinese" people together in their mind. How much are artists supposed to allow for the potential stupidity of the people who might view their work?<br/><br/>And I'm very fond of well-researched efforts towards authenticity. But suppose I put out a silly, cartoony game about "Mythic India" that's full of anachronisms and misunderstandings, and obviously wrong. Whereas a right-wing Hindu supremacist puts out a less distorted and (to outside eyes) far more "authentic" game whose purpose is to appropriate "true Indian" identity for Hindus alone. Who is actually doing more harm in the world? The latter, it appears to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79463/#Comment_79463" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-04T08:12:57+00:00" title="July  4, 2007  8:12AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2007 8:23AM by bankuei.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua:<br/><br/>I don't know of any Roman parties based on current, living Rome.

(also conflating black American culture as media hiphop).<br/><br/>Picking at examples doesn't negate the basic point, which is being demonstrated in this very thread:<br/><br/>Removing the context of power (based in whatever hierarchy, race, gender, heteronormative, etc.) is a great way to mask the what is going on and why it's cultural appropriation and not sharing.<br/><br/>When you remove the context of power, you might as well say that a five year old punching an adult is the same as an adult punching a five year old.

She says quite clearly elsewhere on her blog that white people are simply less caring, more lazy than black people. I disagree. Most people on this planet are racist.

Even if the effects are not the same as physical colonization, the root attitude IS.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely I agree. I'm just not sure what its practical implications are, for me personally in terms of my own game design.<br/><br/>So I have this game, <b>Ganakagok</b>. It's a fantasy, set on an enormous iceberg in a world of eternal night. The characters belong to the Nitu people: they live in ice-brick houses, hunt with harpoons, and practice a kind of shamanistic religion. Pretty obviously, they evoke the Inuit and other Native American peoples of Greenland, Alaska, and Canada, including what is now Nunavut. The trappings of the game include a deck of tarot-like playing cards that include public-domain or licensed imagery (i.e., clip art) from Alaskan, Canadian, and Pacific Northwestern Native American cultures. Let's stipulate that I have <i>legally</i> appropriated  images and motifs from Native American culture to create <b>Ganakagok</b>. And, to be clear, I'm not myself Native American.<br/><br/>Now, I think the game produces phenomenal play that, yes, celebrates Native American culture; people who play find it gripping and powerful, creating "authentic" and tragic folk tales with real resonance. And by no stretch of the imagination are the characters cigar-store Eskimos: they are among the most <i>human</i> RPG characters I have encountered, in terms of being fully fleshed out as fictional characters. If anything, <b>Ganakagok</b> <i>reclaims and reforms</i> the stereotype of the Eskimo in a profound way.<br/><br/>But I recognize that there's a counter-argument: that what I've created is a pastiche that <i>unethically</i> (if not illegally) appropriates images and motifs from Inuit and other cultures. How do I make that judgment, though? In the act of appropriation or in its effect? Or do I defer to someone else's judgment? And, if so, who?

Does the content offend? Does it offend a majority? Does it offend an unreasonable majority? etc. You can try editing the work to make sure it is reaching your desired goal visa vis gameplay and social impact, which I assume is "phenomenal play that celebrates Native American culture." Once you have some indication of the effect, you can weigh that effect against your purpose as an artist and your artistic freedom of expression and make a decision, based on your personal ethics, about the statement you want to make and the impact you want to have on others. <br/><br/>By doing so, you try to release a game that achieves your goal of "phenomenal play" while limiting any offense you cause to the people you were ultimately okay with offending. Those people may, or may not, criticize you and your work on that basis. You respond, and then, of course, everything ends up in a massive flame-war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79490/#Comment_79490" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-04T12:45:42+00:00" title="July  4, 2007 12:45PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Bill:<br/><br/>Consider it not in the sense of laws "Am I allowed to do this?"<br/><br/>Consider it as accepting the consequences of your actions.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79622/#Comment_79622" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-05T10:05:43+00:00" title="July  5, 2007 10:05AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Chris:</p>\n<p>Where I'm disagreeing is that analyzing groups is great for analyzing general trends, but one person's work of art is not a general trend. The obligation of individuals is to other individuals. This is important for two reasons: because communication between two individuals should be on a personal level ("I don't like the way you represented my cultural heritage" instead of "outsiders shouldn't depict cultures they are not part of";) and because I see racism, sexism, classism, and the like as <em>arising from</em> thinking of people as groups instead of individuals.</p>\n<p>This is why I said at the very beginning that I disagreed with both sides arguing about this issue. I'm not going to defend bad artists saying foolish or hurtful things about other people, but I see the opposite side as perpetuating the roots of racism, instead of actually undermining it.</p>\n<p>I completely back Ben's last statement. "Consider it as accepting the consequences of your actions." With the proviso that it has to be <em>your</em> actions, not the actions of a group.</p>\n<p>Joshua (charlequin):</p>\n<p>Take my response to Chris as a response to your general points, also.

There were riots in New York, Boston, and Chicago; city fathers demanded cuts; and Jane Addams and the president of Harvard, among others, wrote chiding letters. All the brouhaha did, though, was (a) incite Griffith, himself the son of a Kentucky colonel, to counterattack, first with pamphlets and then with <em>Intolerance</em> -- in his opinion proof positive that <em>he</em>, at least, was free from prejudice; (b) suggest to anybody who'd managed to keep his cool just how inflammatory this new medium could be; and (c) fuel the movie's publicity and box-office operations.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This is from Judy Jones and William Wilson's <em>An Incomplete Education</em>, which I'm mainly citing because it happens to be a handy reference to actual events surrounding the original release of <em>Birth of a Nation</em>. There was, in fact, substantial criticism of the film <em>at that time</em>. There were also people who ignored the criticism and believed the premise of the film. Arguing about whether it was the criticism of the film that eroded its acceptance or the changing attitudes towards racism is pointless, because it ultimately depends on knowledge of the motives of real people over a 92-year period. But we must acknowledge that there was substantial criticism of the film, substantial enough that Griffith went on the defensive.

The very next thing that happens, after Brand makes a good post, is that Tim pretty violently redirects the conversation AWAY from Shreyas's opinion</blockquote> I agree with Tim's point that discussing the old thread is not on topic in this one, so I'll be brief here. Sydney said that he could see the point you were making in principle, but not how it should apply in this particular case. (You didn't respond to him.) Tim said he *suspected* (not "was pretty sure") there had been a misunderstanding, and was quite ambiguous about who had misunderstood what. He's clarified a bit now, but you seemed happy to assume the worst.<br/><br/>It's not an easy thread to read. I'm receptive to Shreyas' (and others') concerns about a Disney-fied (or whatever) setting, but I'm very uncomfortable with some of the opinions expressed in support of it, both bluntly (in Shreyas' case) and in a more nuanced, lengthy way (in Jonathan's case). If you want to talk about that further, whisper me. I don't think it belongs here.<br/><br/>To get back to the more general question, I agree with Ben's comments about accepting responsibility for your work, including the consequences, whether intended or not. But I think it's a mistake to only value portrayals of culture (whether in the large, as nations/religions, or the smaller, such as doctors or roleplayers) that come from "insiders". IMO, insiders and outsiders have different things to offer: both are potentially valuable. To exclude either at the expense of the other is actually to weaken the culture itself. It's not good when popular perception of a culture is dominated by inaccurate portrayals by outsiders. But in the long term, none of us can do without the mirror held up in front of us, either at a personal or a cultural level, even if we are fed up with being caricatured. To take the example of RPG culture, since we're all familiar with it, I think we all know that a lot of what is written about roleplayers is nonsense. And there are certainly some aspects of roleplaying that can only be understood by people who have actually done some. On the other hand, I can well imagine that if a trained anthropologist were to spend some time studying roleplayers, they would come up with some interesting stuff that no roleplayer is currently aware of. And since "trained" is a relative term, and anthropologists have no exclusive claim on truth, I conclude that I do indeed value the opinions of outsiders about "my" culture, even if I have yet to see any actual opinions that increase my understanding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79746/#Comment_79746" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-06T03:48:16+00:00" title="July  6, 2007  3:48AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>It's not only an uncharitable and inaccurate reading of what I said, it's an uncharitable and inaccurate reading of what Tim said.

There were also people who ignored the criticism and believed the premise of the film. Arguing about whether it was the criticism of the film that eroded its acceptance or the changing attitudes towards racism is pointless, because it ultimately depends on knowledge of the motives of real people over a 92-year period. But we must acknowledge that there was substantial criticism of the film, substantial enough that Griffith went on the defensive. Otherwise, why did he do what he did?</blockquote>\nI don't think that anyone claimed that there wasn't some protest and criticism of the movie at the time.  However, there were also many people who lauded it -- both for its art and its message.  My point in bringing the film up was that the problem of racial stereotypes in fiction is that it reinforces a racially-biased culture -- not just offending.  The problem with <i>Birth of a Nation</i> wasn't that the blacks who saw it had their feelings hurt.  <br/><br/>I say this because it seems that some people treat offending minorities as the primary problem.  i.e. Hypothetically, someone produces a game about East Asia and thinks "Well, I should try not to offend sensitive Asian players."  I think if Asian players are offended, it can be a useful test of the work -- but that doesn't mean it is the primary problem of having stereotypes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80939/#Comment_80939" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T13:04:36+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  1:04PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, a related thought: on RPGNet, there is a thread today on <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=343549" rel="nofollow">50 reasons why a campaign set in the Dark Ages/Late Antiquity would be REALLY cool.</a>  I immediately thought: "Hell yeah!" and proceeded to throw <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=7538403&amp;postcount=7" rel="nofollow">about 20 things I'd love in such a period</a>.
