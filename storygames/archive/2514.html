I figured I'd kick off discussion of "create or roll the dice" techniques. Here are the ones I can think of, feel free to add more, or discuss variants.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limiting Stats</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This first appeared in the original D&amp;D character creation techniques: roll dice for each ability score in order, which limits or suggests which character classes you can select. This was probably designed originally for play balance, but it also serves as creative input; players who really don't know which character class they want to play can roll first and decide which class seems the best fit. "Oh, I have a 17 Strength and 7 Intelligence? Sounds like a big dumb fighter."</p>\n<p>D&amp;D moved away from this approach, but you can see something similar and more detailed in The Dying Earth RPG, where you have the option to roll for random results for one part of your character in exchange for extra points to distribute in another part.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chart Lookups</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Roll dice and look up the results on a chart. This first showed up in D&amp;D for wandering monster rolls, but later attempts at random dungeon  or NPC creation resulted in play aides like the old Central Casting books or AEG's Toolbox, which is nothing but loads of charts organized in chapters. The problem with this approach is it's clunky to use during play, because you have to look up the specific chart. There's rarely any thought to organizing the charts to allow quick access.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Motifs</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Randomly select an abstract concept and embellish to add details. I'm thinking the first example of this is Whimsy Cards, but I've never seen these in person, so I only have the vaguest idea how they were used. I do remember seeing in one of the Rolemaster Companions a set of "rune cards", each one labeled with three or four nouns of varying type (creature, object, event). The optional rules suggest that a GM could draw one card for which enemy to randomly throw at the party, a second card for the plot hook, and so on. You could even draw more than one card for "creature" and attempt to merge the result, turning "goblin" and "wizard" into a goblin wizard, for example.</p>\n<p>Everway is probably another example of this, but someone else should fill in the details on how that worked.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stakes</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The player suggest two opposite results and rolls to determine which to choose. Its simplest, oldest form is to ask a yes-or-no question and roll one die to determine the result (The Fantasy Trip: In the Labyrinth suggested doing this to determine if a corpse has a dagger on it or things like that.) A later example of this is the Donjon approach of letting a "search for secret doors" roll determine whether or not there is a door instead of whether the player finds a pre-existing door. Stakes setting as we have come to think of it is another example, except that instead of yes/no you are usually determining good/bad, or sometimes two sets of stakes at the same time, like in Elfs.</p>\n<p>I'm toying with another form where "search for secret doors" is a risk you take; the player choosing to roll the dice means there <em>is</em> a door, but the stakes are whether there's a bad effect as well (trap on the door.) Or, in a variant I call "flashback risks", the player can choose to roll for "one of the opponents is my old college buddy" but the risk is something like "we left on bad terms and he wants to get even".</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Visual Mapping</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Roll dice or drop tokens to determine results based on where they fall. I have never seen this in any old RPG, although I've heard of a GM tool that let you determine hit locations based on bull's eyes superimposed on silhouettes (but I think the concentric circles were numbered and you rolled dice to determine distance and direction on the bull's eye, instead of dropping dice on the playsheet.</p>\n<p>I'm using this a lot, after reading about visual mapping in The Design of Everyday Things. I think it reduces the learning curve a great deal. First time i used it was in <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Raiders_of_the_Ruins_of_Kanthe.php" rel="nofollow">my solo dungeon crawl game</a>, mainly for mapping; the most recent version of the Kanthe rules works out a lot of bugs in the original system and elaborates it a good deal. For mapping, I roll six-sided dice with pip <em>on</em> the sheet I'm drawing the map on; the shape of the dot patterns determines whether there's a room or corridor where each die lands, and the orientation of the die determines the orientation of the room. This creates much better-looking dungeon maps than the ancient chart lookup methods, and does it much more quickly, too.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Combo Techniques</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Combinations of the above. For example, in Kanthe I also roll dice on a sheet with three nested squares labeled "doors and traps" (outer square,) "creatures and beasts" (middle square,) and "features and hazards" (center square.) Where each die lands and whether the result is high or low determines what general category is in the room, a second roll on another sheet determines what it is, exactly. This is a Visual Mapping + Motif/Chart Lookup technique.</p>\n<p>Anyone have any more examples or variants? Or a technique that doesn't fit into the above categories?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58069/#Comment_58069" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-25T15:56:57+00:00" title="February 25, 2007  3:56PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Oh, great, I forgot one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rerolls</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is using die result rerolls to affect fiction. Several games have had hero-point-like resources you can spend to reroll the dice, but only some of them require both the original result and the rerolled result to be represented in the fiction: you spend a point and describe what your character does to try to turn a failure into a success, then roll the dice. I can't think of which ones do it this way (Adventure?)</p>\n<p>Trollbabe does this, too, but gets rid of hero-points and makes fictional elements like a remembered spell or a relationship become resources that you can use to get a reroll. I'm following this route in the Kanthe game and my more recent designs as well: talents and advantages give an opportunity to reroll one or more results.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58102/#Comment_58102" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-26T05:08:38+00:00" title="February 26, 2007  5:08AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Make and argument and roll to see if it happens."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a "create and roll for it" mechanism. Unlike stakes setting (which also has players making up actions) the player says what they want to happen and get a single straight roll. Other players have the option of jumping in with counter-arguments at which point it becomes more like a stakes roll - just between different players visions rather than one player's vision. All that is required is that someone act as referee to decide what players need to roll (I use a human ref. but others prefer strength charts or other mechanisms).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can be grafted into existing games without changing anything in the original game and dropped just as fast. Very virus like. <br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58271/#Comment_58271" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T09:40:41+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  9:40AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'd classify that with Stakes, Chris, although it resembles the early yes-or-no stakes (with multiple simultaneous stakes possible) more than the currently popular mode of stakes setting.
