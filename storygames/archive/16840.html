I grew unexpectedly attached to Salty Chubtoe, the bad-ass halfling mariner and was surprisingly sad when she perished in flames...<br/>Our East-Side party was quite proud of ourselves for escaping with at least a character each still alive. That pride lasted until we watched the West-Siders somehow confront the Lich Lord in the form of a dragon, and conquer him! What the what? Mass props, Westies. Eat the rich.<br/><br/><b>A Taste for Murder: The Unfortunate Affair of Poor Ms. Mallory</b> Sat01<br/>I pitched this at the donut, and was blessed to have Matthew Klein join to co-facilitate. Wilhelm played Lady Victoria, the disapproving dowager aunt. Marc was Amelia, American wife to the ever-absent lord of the house. I was Charles, disappointing son. Dale played Julian, bastard son from before the lord married, now retained as a servant. Matthew K. was lady's maid Ms. Mallory, confidante and murder victim. The game was a bit rushed and abridged to fit the short morning slot, but as Wilhelm said: "It went well...There was cousin-fucking and a double murder."<br/><br/><b>The Lottery: World of Megadungeon</b> Sat02<br/>Ben ran a rollicking World of Dungeon rush through the megadungeon, played right on the table-sized crowd-sourced map. I don't remember the name of the lady playing fledgling adventurer Wit the Hapless, but the dynamic between Wit and the assumed leadership of my ranger was a blast! Patch the ranger(former pirate) was a bit touched in the head: having just been rescued from 8 years of isolation on a jungle island he was now on a bloodthirsty quest for revenge. But for some reason, Wit saw Patch as the "Professor of Plunder", and every time Wit would say "Oh yes master, what a fantastic plan" it inspired me to come up with something even MORE ill conceived for our next obstacle. This snowballing continued to Patch's well-earned death, with Wit continuing to victory. A most satisfactory conclusion.<br/><br/>Those were all three very pleasing successes.  Not so pleasing was a failed Fortitude save that left me distracted and in degrading health, so I had to bail after Sat02. Weaksauce.<br/><br/>Also, I had started to introduce myself to some Gig Harbor peeps just before the lottery, but my rapid exit prevented following up on those initial introductions. So, hey gamers, I'm down in North Tacoma if anyone wants to do any get-togetherness. I'm reachable at "jjspackle" on the gmails. Or a whisper here, of course.<br/><br/>It was marvelous to spend time with you all. Both Eric and Lee brought delightful beer products on Friday, which was a treat.<br/>Praise and exultation to the organizers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384132/#Comment_384132" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-02T14:40:41+00:00" title="July  2, 2012  2:40PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            so tired                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384134/#Comment_384134" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-02T14:42:48+00:00" title="July  2, 2012  2:42PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2012 2:58PM by skinnyghost.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So tired also.<br/><br/>I played, without commentary (though I will add it later).<br/>* Dungeon Crawl Classics<br/>* Marvel Heroic Roleplaying<br/>* Basic D&amp;D<br/>* Cards Against Humanity<br/>* Anima Prime<br/>* Refuge in Audacity<br/>* Escape from the Aliens in Outer Space<br/>* The Regiment<br/><br/>There wasn't a single negative experience for me the whole con.

First ever playing this game despite owning it, will absolutely be going back to it again)<br/>-<b> Donut: Ogre's GI Joe 1946 AW hack</b> that I can't remember the specific name of. Will eventually go by something like Commando World. (Enjoyable over-the-top fun, not knowing anything about GI Joe or WWII thankfully was not a major barrier to play)<br/>- <b>Geiger World</b> (what I've always imagined Gamma World's setting would feel like. Dr. Dinosaur was hilarious)<br/>- <b>3:16 Carnage Amongst The Stars</b> (This was really really neat having two groups on the same ship doing different missions and then meeting together again. All the props and I believe Neil's acting as Captain Stacy made it all very impressive. The E-Cannon is a horrifying weapon)<br/>- <b>Donut: Metamorphosis Omicron</b> (Wow, very strange, but between an amazing setting premise and the wacky humor coming out of finding and not comprehending things we take for granted it was highly entertaining. Thanks Tony for showing me a game I would have never even have thought to look at)<br/><br/>Overall, like Adam, not a single bad experience. It was not just my first GPNW but my first con ever and my first time playing with people who aren't the group I started RPGs with, so thank you so much to everyone who played with or ran for me for making my first experience solid gold.

My ultimate frisbee player / marijuana cultivator is facing off against Matthew's creepy fiftysomething (roached) Buick dealership owner in a battle for ultimate xmas light display supremacy.  <br/><br/>My character has diverted her surplus in-house power generating capacity in order to supercharge her massive blinding edifice of holiday joy!

We probably had too many players (I think like 7?), but despite having not slept at all the previous evening this was still pretty fun. Much over-the-top cinematic description, and my angel had two guns and so was twice as awesome. I did have to bow out early, unfortunately, and so never got to see what the non-shooty parts of the game might have been like.<br/><br/>Saturday morning: I facilitated <b>My Daughter, The Queen of France</b>. The least-experienced-with-the-game player ended up playing Shakespeare, which in retrospect was probably not the best idea -- and I should have done a better job of explaining just how unilaterally Shakespeare has to operate. But despite some uncertainty from our author-figure, this was still an enjoyable and at-times-hilarious game. Only Billy Shakespeare would take his twin 16-year-old daughters to Chucky Cheese for a surprise birthday party, and then complain when they refused to enjoy the wonders of Whack-a-Mole.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon: <b>Monsterhearts</b>, with Jackson (MC), Jay, Erin Sara and Orion. I still feel bad for ditching my Lottery group for this game, but it was pretty well worth it (and it sounds like they had fun without me, yay!) Orion took Jackson's latest playbook-in-progress, The Sasquatch, for a test drive, and the Fae spent most of the game trying to get our hirsute wallflower out of her shell -- and down to the local roller-rink. Meanwhile my Ghoul, hungry for fear, made a date with NPC Monique 'out at the old abandoned factory in the middle of nowhere' -- who could say no? Erin Sara's werewolf skipped school, got drunk on rooftops, punched everyone he wasn't busy Turning On, and pretty compelling demonstrated that there are some bullies that it probably isn't worth standing up to.<br/><br/>Also, best new Monsterhearts rule: <i>when you try and pick out a killer outfit at the thrift store</i>, roll to <b>Gaze Into The Abyss</b>...<br/><br/>Saturday evening: <b>Silver &amp; White</b>, with Morgan, Jay and Ben Robbins. I love this game so much. First I get all excited about the teenage-relationship-stuff, and then when I sit down to play it, I suddenly remember that there's a whole bunch of amazing Mysterious-Fiction-Creation icing right on top of that! Our game featured two un- or semi-requited homosexual crushes, and Jay &amp; I spent most of the game passing the 'you are feeling Frustrated' and 'you are feeling Desire' cards back and forth between our (female) characters. Morgan complained at the lack of make-outs in this game, but it was mostly his fault for constantly cutting scenes right as I was getting ready to make my move -- awkward teenage romance needs time to build momentum!<br/><br/>It was also fun playing the only character who was more interested in figuring out the machine/photographs than hitting up our dead teacher's liquor cabinet -- though they did at least invent a new mixed drink, the 18 Year Old Fantasy (18-year-old scotch + orange fanta.)<br/><br/><br/>Running out of steam, so I will have to summarize my Sunday games a bit later.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384181/#Comment_384181" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-02T21:45:15+00:00" title="July  2, 2012  9:45PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2012 9:46PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If folks want to reconnect with the people they played with, get your copy-n-paste on and start threads (or just placeholders) in the <b><a href="http://www.goplaynw.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=23" rel="nofollow">GPNW Afterglow: What We Played</a></b>.<br/><br/>That way even if you can't remember all the people you played with folks can find it by looking at the slot.

Both World of Dungeons were run by me, using the Community-Designed Megadungeon, which rocked despite its occasional silliness (some might say because of).

I managed to scavenge some cupcakes and fries but I was definitely feeling pangs of hunger by the end of that last session.

"Sevastopol Rebooted" was great fun running two squads in the Narcissus and Daisy campaigns. Alpha Squad faired a bit better than Beta but it was tough going all around. Sgt. Penman (Wilson) talking common sense into a smart bomb, Buzzsaw (John) getting the squad to walk on water, Cpl Smiles (Max) racking insane kills, and Nobel's (Jonathan's) flashback to his dad in an airlock (using a Strength to save the day in the final scene), were all worth the price of admission.<br/><b>SUN03:</b> Tony's wacky but gratifying <b>Metamorphosis Omicron</b> game with Max, Jonathan, Kingston &amp; Jay. The interplay between us gelled quickly and we even had an engaging post-game discussion.

Maybe there was some radium in that Waterdeep box. Speaking of!<br/><br/><b>FRI-00: Lords of Waterdeep</b><br/>This was great fun. Thanks for bringing it, Matt! The game is definitely well designed, with mechanics that quickly make sense but also provide depth that will require several plays to really explore.<br/><br/><b>FRI-01: AMMO</b><br/>Daniel wrote about it further up. Great fun, especially rolling a die for each shot you're firing. Brilliant. Also, Erin Sara's narration of her angel appearing gave me chills.<br/><br/><b>FRI-02: Anima Prime Unity Core</b><br/>Andrew and Jay Loomis stuck around to have some Final Fantasy-style fun with me and my little alpha version of the card-driven cooperative mod for Anima Prime. It was a tough fight, with two characters taken out by the end. It was also so much fun that we played until 1:30 am.<br/><br/><b>SAT-01: Hellcats and Hockeysticks</b><br/>Dawn ran a Harry Potter-skinned version of this game. The six of us players were an all-female Quidditch team. There was plenty of hijinx with a stolen trophy, voodoo dolls of other teams, herbal experimentation, and not-so-secret rivalries. The characters' special shticks played important roles, and I felt that we had a lot of really neat inter-PC moments going on. Thanks Dawn!<br/><br/><b>SAT-02: Mythender</b><br/>I played this game first at GPNW 2008, and while a lot of it changed, the core was still the same. It's turned out beautifully. We fought Heimdall, the God of Rock. There were blood groupies, stinging solos, a rock stage in a sea of lava, and mythic booing attacks. The corruption mechanic is wonderful and gave unexpected poignancy to the over-the-top action story we built.<br/><br/><b>SAT-03: Cards Against Humanity</b><br/>I'm not sure I can talk about this experience very much without making you all think we're horrible, horrible human beings. Let's say that the tamest moment of the game, which is a cross of Apples to Apples, Madlibs, and Tourette Syndrome, was "Ghandi + Famine = Skeletor."  And that's just the tip. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>SUN-01: Anima Prime</b><br/>I GMed this round, trying out some optional rules that make it a bit faster for convention play (which worked great). The PCs were a gang of freedom fighters who left a trail of collateral damage in their wake. We had an ex-assassin of the empire, a sniper, a young firecaster, and the cynical old travelled-back-in-time version of the firecaster. Yeah. It was great. We couldn't quite finish, because a 3-hour-slot is just very short when you have to make characters in the beginning, but it seemed like everyone had fun.<br/><br/><b>SUN-02: Dog Eat Dog</b><br/>I got to play this game of colonialism with friends I already know well, which I think is a good idea, given how tragic this game can get. The system is not very complicated, but it is permeated with the power inequality of the subject matter. The way more and more rules are established that the occupied people have to follow naturally leads to a struggle between resistance (which has to turn violent) or giving up your culture and who you were before the occupation. Powerful stuff. I would love to tell you more about our session, but I think in order to understand the impact of it, I'd have to go through it all, because it just grew so strongly from scene to scene, from the very first parts of setting it up to the epilogues.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone who played in these, and sorry everyone I didn't get to play with. It was wonderful all around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
