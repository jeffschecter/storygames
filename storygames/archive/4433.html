This game is often limited to their character sheet and their own numbers.  It is solitary and often fiercely private.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, they are playing a game which is all open, all out front, all joint with the other players.  It's often on an entirely different set of resources (and often contains vastly more of the fiction of the game).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cross-over inputs between these two games are sometimes remarkably few.  I'm sitting there watching my fighter's hit points dwindle away under Balrog attack, and when a lightning bolt arches in from the character sheet of our mage, I'm like "Holy shit!  <i>Deus ex machina</i>!  Suddenly it's a whole new ball-game!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cross-over inputs are sometimes remarkably tightly intertwined ... to the point where I would argue that large portions of the character sheet of all players become part of "Our game" rather than their private property.  "C'mon, c'mon!  You can see my hit-points here, people!  Gimme some artillery support.  And Matt, I know you've got the spell slots to fast-cast a Cure Major, so don't sit there hauling away with your dinky little d8 mace when you've got a front-line fighter about to drop in his boots!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is without even <i>getting into</i> the fact that some people's private game is an entirely different game with entirely different rules ... yeah, Mr. GM, I'm lookin' at <b>you</b>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my thought for the morning.  Not quite sure how to capitalize on it in design, but I think there should be a way.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100116/#Comment_100116" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T05:49:25+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  5:49AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a bit of a breakdown into SIS and one's own IS (and immersing), I suppose?

I'll probably get blasted for this, but the fact is... who are you competing against? Can't be the GM and his monsters... those challenges are local and then gone, and the GM can kill you easy if he wants. No, the GM stuff is just the race by which we measure each other against each other. <br>\n<br>\nThat is, it only becomes a "team" sport when the "tragedy of the commons" problem hits, as in the example, and you can argue that all will fail in the long-run, if aid is not given. Otherwise it's about how well one can drive his character up levels and make his character the kick-ass-est. <br>\n<br>\nSo, yeah, in that sort of play, you keep your strategy and info to yourself, and only reveal it when you need to do so. <br>\n<br>\nAt leas that's my hypothesis.

If you have limited personal resources, you choose how much of them to bring forward to the table based on your involvement in the situation, your desire and need.  The tension is what brings some of the character's motivations into the player's attention.  When you use an explicitly personal resource for a team goal, you are making a real statement of priorities (particularly if it is irreplacable).  Group control of these personal resources would make for a more efficient larger game (more investment in the consensual reality), but less personal investment in a single character.  But perhaps I'm missing your point.  Arguing with another player to bring their resources to the group sounds like interesting troupe tension to me; that could be an interesting mechanical avenue.

I'm trying to be descriptive, not prescriptive.  "My game" is the part of play that I, in playing, perceive as being mine and mine alone.  "Our game" (for me, at least) is the thing that I perceive as being shared with the group.<br/><br/>Sometimes (in fact, I'd say <i>often</i>) people perceive the selection of game resources as something that is theirs alone, but as the D&amp;D example ("Use your lightning bolt!  Use it now!") illustrates, that is not the only way to perceive it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100239/#Comment_100239" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T12:30:05+00:00" title="October  1, 2007 12:30PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay.

Some you can start with, others you can bring into play via the Prizes mechanics, and a few are only available in a preset group of circumstances.  The players, in this case, have the ability to see what the GM can do, but they can only intervene in very limited ways.  (E.g., they can bring the fortune Malcontentment into play.)<br/><br/>The players instead have access to <i>Opportunities</i>, a set of options that the players have access to collectively, with the character elected Captain possessing certain privileges in controlling these options--though the other players have an investment and influence over those choices.<br/><br/>Players can then create mutual bonds between subgroups by means of Bargains, and each has some partial control over their own character.  The more I think about it, the different parts of the system break down into different sub-games with different participants, in exactly the way Tony suggests.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100282/#Comment_100282" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T13:50:53+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  1:50PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

Take a look at batting cages.  There's not much too it besides hit <i>that</i> ball with <i>this</i> bat, but that's still a game.<br/><br/>The GMs game or typical D&amp;D game is like solitare. You've got your deck (monsters and NPCs) to set up.  The big difference is that instead of ending when you run out of cards, you end when you think there's a sufficient challenge or story in place.<br/><br/>The player's game is looking at what they can do: spells, attacks, movement and what they have to do it with: feats, remaining spells, hit points, bonuses.<br/><br/>Whether its fun or not, is a different story.

There is the building/painting of miniatures, the army construction (and accompanying shopping sprees), and the actual play. All three are wildly different activities, but all feed into what it means to be a Warhammer player. Now, the army construction is about spending a limited amount of army points to construct a force that can handle anything as well as deliver on a few different routes to victory. Kinda similar to, say... prepping a session of D&amp;D, as the GM.

Games are the constructed activity that arise out of play.  If Tony LB is over there angsting in his head about the hit points dropping while he slugs toe-to-toe with the Balrog, and I'm over here looking at my spells and figuring out the optimal time to drop a lightning bolt on the baddie, we're each doing me-play, which intersects into some us-play, but it's all still the same game.<br/><br/>Ditto for the Dogs example.  Me sitting, looking at my sheet and trying to figure out how to make a raise that lets me use my "Good with horses 3d10" trait is totally me-play.  My raising with a 4 and a 9 for 13 and saying "Over the next week we catch the guy, because I know how to keep our horses endurance up." is us-play.  But it's all still part of the same game.<br/><br/>In case it's not clear, I'm totally on the same page as Tony with the split he describes, and that it's a place that design can and should look at, I'm just disagreeing with his terminology.<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100854/#Comment_100854" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T13:14:20+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  1:14PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, that makes sense.
