Ever since I heard about real-life super heroes I wanted to game them. That's right, I wanted to play at someone playing at being a super hero. And Fiasco seemed like the obvious choice. And now I don't even have to make a playset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>[Heroics 2]<br/><br/>Just watched Defendor and Super for the first time over the past day, and Defendor I felt a morbid fascination with, because of Arthur's whole situation in life, and I wondered if that excused some of his actions.<br/><br/>Then with Super, I just felt completely sick by the end of it. Actually, I was totally glee-ing when some of the weirder crap happened, like beating someone in the head with a pipe wrench for butting in line and the recurring catchphrase, "Shut up, crime!" From the sex scene on, however, it was more disturbing than anything else.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Now I TOTALLY want to play this game.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359590/#Comment_359590" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T12:30:59+00:00" title="February 14, 2012 12:30PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, excellent!  I remember seeing one Superhero playset, and I'm glad to know there's at least one more.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear about people playing Heroics, but since it's not even two weeks old, that might be asking for a lot.<br/><br/>So, this is a space for Neko to talk about it. Personally, I'm interested in difficulties and wins in writing it (especially as it sounds like the last of a stint of Fiasco playset writing).<br/><br/>Also, I'm interested to know what other superhero and/or comic book themed Fiasco playsets are out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359600/#Comment_359600" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T12:49:40+00:00" title="February 14, 2012 12:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, okay. Well, Heroics was different from the other playsets I've done in that there was a lot of fictional material to go through. For "Knights of Light" I had The Guild and not much else, and for "The Big Anime Con" I had over a decade of attending cons in real life to draw on, but for Heroics there were three movies and a few comics to draw on. I got the idea for Heroics a while back when I saw Super in a theater, and when I watched Defendor during my push to finish it off I knew that "a jar of angry wasps" just <i>had</i> to be an Object. A lot of it was going through the relevant Wikipedia articles (and apparently Kick-Ass has an ongoing comic sequel) and plucking ideas.<br/><br/>It was also the first playset I did after the Fiasco Companion came out, so I had its advice in mind, which is why the elements in it are by and large shorter than in my other playsets. I don't know when I'll be able to try it out, but I do worry about the balance between the "dumb superheroes" side of things and the "evil motherfucking organized crime guys" side.<br/><br/>In general I like stories about people who dream about fantastical stuff but live in the real world. Fandom in general has this amazing energy that can be beautiful or awful. Great ambition and poor impulse control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359613/#Comment_359613" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T13:02:49+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  1:02PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pulp Poet</cite>Also, I'm interested to know what other superhero and/or comic book themed Fiasco playsets are out there.</blockquote>\nI wrote <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/wiki/index.php?title=Science_Comics" rel="nofollow">Science Comics</a>, which is basically a Venture Brothers/Dr. Horrible/live action Tick superhero playset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360215/#Comment_360215" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T10:50:13+00:00" title="February 17, 2012 10:50AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/20584502" rel="nofollow">We played it.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
