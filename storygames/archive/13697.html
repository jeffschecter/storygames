In explaining what it means to be conscious, Dr. Siegel used the metaphor of driving. A driver, in order to be in control of the car, must in the first place monitor where the car is going. She must also be in the driver's seat, actively responding to stimuli and moving the car according to her own will. A passenger in the back seat may be able to monitor the car's movement, but is not in control the car.<br/><br/>That immediately brought my mind to the distribution of narrative authority in story games. In the traditional model, the players narrate the actions of the PCs and the GM controls everything else. (D&amp;D, GURPS) In less-traditional distributive models, the winner of a roll or draw might gain narrative authority over all of the elements in a conflict or scene. (Primetime Adventures, Shooting the Moon) Whatever the specifics, there is always some distribution of narrative authority, else it's a novel or a roleplay with no rules. I wouldn't derogate either of those pursuits, both of which I indulge in from time to time, but neither of them is story gaming.<br/><br/>To use the driving metaphor, when it comes to an element of the game such as a character or the weather, one person is in the driver's seat and in narrative control. The other participants can make suggestions from the backseat (occasionally to an annoying degree) and they can also seek to take over the driver's seat according to established rules if they so provide. What the player without authority may not do, however, is try to wrest the steering wheel away without prior agreement. That way lies a car wreck, both of the game and often player relationships.<br/><br/>What does fighting for the steering wheel look like in actual gaming terms? <b>Railroading</b> is a prime example. This is where the GM tries to negate the players' narrative control over their respective characters by force of story. Events are contrived so player choices make no difference to the outcome. Both players and GM might engage in <b>ignoring narration,</b> acting like someone's in-game declaration was not even made. The NPC doesn't respond to your character, or the PCs might continue traveling as if the GM had not said there was a blinding blizzard in the valley. This can also be done unintentionally, especially with poor organization or in hectic surroundings.<br/><br/>Once or twice I've been subject to <b>narrative ambush,</b> where a player pulls out an NPC action without any basis in the rules or without consulting the GM first. Don't get me wrong, I like player input as much as the next GM. I just like to have some prior consultation, even seconds in advance, so I can prepare a bit and not look stupid because I'm supposedly there to play NPCs but have no idea who the person is. A less clear-cut case of grabbing the narrative steering wheel is when a participant uses <b>emotional punishment</b> to deter some types of narration, even all narration, from a player. This is not always distinguishable from poor feedback-giving skill, but it does interfere with narrative authority in a broad sense if the receiving player responds by shrinking away from the condemnation. It's often a sign of unresolved out-of-game issues cloaked as in-game critique.<br/><br/>Thinking in terms of narrative authority, I've found, can be an interesting angle to look an dysfunction (or, for that matter, function) at the gaming table. When things are getting the wrong kind of tense, between players instead of characters, it's a good item to put on the mental checklist. With this narrative element, am I a driver or a passenger? If a passenger, am I being constructive and entertaining from my seat, or am I shading into annoying backseat driver territory, or am I slapping the driver's hands away from the steering wheel? If the second or third description fits, it's time to take a breath, step back, and apologize if necessary. Maybe it's time to take a hard look at the game and make some big changes, if the problem is structurally ingrained like constant railroading. Let the driver drive! In a story game, everyone drives something anyway.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310015/#Comment_310015" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T05:32:52+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  5:32AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love narrative ambushes.

My wife's response was fine I thought... She listened to the whole thing and then said, "Ok, but we've got to roll for it because that sounds like a conflict to me. If you win, then what you described happens exactly that way. If I win, then [npc] actually does [whatever]. If anyone wants to help [player] just let me know how you're helping her make that happen."<br/><br/>Overall, she was pretty happy to let a fair amount of control go like that and freely admitted to the gals that some of what they came up with was more awesome than what she'd thought of. She also founf that simply listening to the player spin out the whole narrative like they charged ahead doing was helpful to decide how hard it would actually be. And she'd let them know before the dice were picked up, so if they instead wanted to change their narration based on how difficult she said it would be, they could.<br/><br/>So I would say that "narrative ambush" isn't actually a problem necessarily, but it depends on people being willing to actually hqve qn agreement to how to resolve the apparent conflict that happens between the GM's idea and the player's idea. When my wife asked for GMing advice I said, "I don't have a whole lot to say, because I've been doing this for more than 20 years. I don't want to ruin your fun or the other gals either. So, 'Say yes or throw the dice', by which I mean that if a player wants something and it's not really going to have a significant impact in what you're trying to do, just let 'em have it. And if it is a problem, try saying 'Yes, but...' before you toss the dice. Make sure it's clear what the actual stakes are. Don't roll dice for something that the players need, like a clue or something. That's just busy work and if they fail, you're still going to have to give it to them anyway, only now you're going to have to jump through hoops."<br/><br/>She did just fine and had 2 solid converts to rpgs; she's in Seattle right now and running another game for a couple of her long-time friends and a couple of other experienced D&amp;Ders. Her friends already tried D&amp;D (4e) and were completely overwhelmed and didn't like it, so she offered to run a game for them so they could see a completely different side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310170/#Comment_310170" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T19:30:14+00:00" title="January 29, 2011  7:30PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eldir</cite>Yeah, in moderation it can be great. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I only really have a problem with it when someone uses it to shortcut discussion on something they know/are afraid someone else will disagree with.

[snip more good advice]</blockquote>\nThat is an excellent way to deal with ambush, though I wouldn't say you're describing anything actually dysfunctional. I think the advice you gave your wife is a great illustration of the two main ways that interaction happens across lines of narrative authority: Communication ("just let 'em have it") and rules adjudication ("toss the dice"). One doesn't preclude the other, of course; as you described, the player's desired narration informs both the terms of communication and the way adjudication is made.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Scurvy_Platypus</cite>But [poor communication being a problem is] kinda true in _anything_ isn't it?</blockquote>\nYes, it is. A thousand times yes.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Scurvy_Platypus</cite>Usually it seems to come from a fear of not getting what they want/need combined sometimes with a lack of finesse in communication styles or achieving a result that might not be ideal, but satisfies most participant's needs as best as possible.</blockquote>\nAlso sometimes a pathological fear of rejection or failure, manifested by behavior like not accepting a failing roll, or just going ahead and narrating things that are entirely another player or GM's authority, and then refusing to have a constructive discussion before or after. Something like this:\n<blockquote><b>Alice:</b> Well, Fellow PC Bob, you suffered a humiliating defeat to Charlie, my favorite NPC, the last time around. So I wouldn't be so cocky if I were you.<br/><b>Bob's Player:</b> Whoa whoa! What brought this on? I lost to <i>Charlie?</i><br/><b>GM:</b> I hadn't thought about it one way or the other. That could change a lot of things, but it could be really interesting. You guys want to take it in that direction?<br/><b>Bob's Player:</b> Hmm, I don't know. Bob's supposed to be an amazing swordsman and Charlie's not that good as far as we know, so I was surprised. What do you think, Alice's Player? Why'd you think it's a good idea for Bob to lose to Charlie, or at least for Alice to think he did?<br/><b>Alice's Player:</b> Well, I thought it would... I thought Charlie was... I'm sorry. Please cancel my line if you don't like it.<br/><b>GM &amp; Bob's Player:</b> (Exchange exasperated looks) </blockquote>\nSometimes I'm kind of amazed at how "naked" an act roleplaying is. Something about sharing your cherished fantasies with other people and interacting with them on a regular basis brings out so many psychological and social fault lines, it can be embarrassing. (Of course it brings out even more strengths and awesomeness.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310210/#Comment_310210" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-30T17:13:09+00:00" title="January 30, 2011  5:13PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is.. that an example of a narrative ambush?

(In English, at any rate. I usually blog in Korean.) I used it to refer to situations where a participant in the game narrates about a narrative element (usually a character) that they don't have formal authority over, in the absence of mutual agreement or a rule that allows such a takeover. That would be, for instance, a player narrating an NPC's or another player character's actions, or the GM deciding what a PC is doing.<br/><br/>In the example, which is similar to what happened in play a couple of times, Player A narrates something to do with Player B's character and an NPC. Player A has authority over her character Alice, but Player B and the GM have authority over Bob the PC and Charlie the NPC respectively. Thus, Player A is staging an impromptu takeover of narrative authority without an agreement or a rule, something Player B and the GM found jarring.<br/><br/>As Jason said, it wouldn't be much of a problem if the narration was something everyone found interesting--groups just roll with such impromptu declarations all the time. It's still a takeover or ambush, but one that forms almost instant agreement after the fact. Other times, when there is contradiction or objection, the need for discussion arises since it ultimately has to be confirmed by those who hold narrative authority. The situation quickly becomes dysfunctional if that discussion is not engaged in. The real-life A had some confusion with narrative authority which irritated some people, though I think the much greater problem was with passive aggression and bad communication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_310216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310216/#Comment_310216" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-30T22:19:05+00:00" title="January 30, 2011 10:19PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2011 10:21PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eldir</cite>What does fighting for the steering wheel look like in actual gaming terms?<b>Railroading</b>is a prime example.

The point of <i>railroading as a tool</i> being to lay down a narrative framework, within which the players are free to focus on other sides of their characters.<br/><br/>So; to regard <i>railroading</i> in your metaphorical sense; it's not "fighting for the steering wheel", but rather keeping a firm grip on it, to bring the game where it is supposed to go. <br/><br/>- Say, you've got this family going to the family cottage. Them driving to the cottage in the mountains is not up for narrative improvisation, but how they relate to each other in the confined space of the car is. The narration of the actual trip is done as a framework for their interaction in the car, setting up situations with some tension to them, having players investigating the relationships and reactions of their characters, resulting in a tight psycho-social drama.<br/><br/>- Or; you've got this party of adventurers, and they have been asked to brave The Valley of Death to the end, to lay down a living sacrifice on the altar in the Dark Temple innermost in the valley. The game is all about what kind of strange, symbolic challenges awaits them during the march, and how their choices comes together in the final scene, when they find themselves unable to meet the final challenge without sacrificing one of themselves on the altar. The nature of the symbolic challenges, and the wandering of the vally, is not up for narrative improvisation, but how they meet the challenges is, and so is how they respond to the final paradox, resulting in a highly laden drama of ethics.<br/><br/>In such games, where the steering wheel is firmly in the hands of "the scenario" (represented by scene-cards drawn, the GMs leadership, or the players informed adherence to the intention of the game), the point is to shift the focus of interaction towards the psychological, social or symbolic content. <i>Railroading</i> is a very effective tool for doing this, when it is done consciously and purposefully, with a narrative frame built to inspire exactly the drama you're aiming for. Some modern games does this without blinking.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eldir</cite>Both players and GM might engage in<b>ignoring narration,</b>acting like someone's in-game declaration was not even made. The NPC doesn't respond to your character, or the PCs might continue traveling as if the GM had not said there was a blinding blizzard in the valley.

The point of<i>railroading as a tool</i>being to lay down a narrative framework, within which the players are free to focus on other sides of their characters.<br/><br/>So; to regard<i>railroading</i>in your metaphorical sense; it's not "fighting for the steering wheel", but rather keeping a firm grip on it, to bring the game where it is supposed to go.</blockquote>\nPlease note that I said crossing narrative authority boundaries is only a problem when there is no agreement:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eldir</cite> What the player without authority may not do, however, is try to wrest the steering wheel away without prior agreement.</blockquote>\nNarrative boundaries are crossed legitimately in one or both of two ways: Agreement and adjudication. As an example of agreement, the GM can willingly hand over an NPC to a player. The players can also willingly suspend their freedom over their characters, whether the agreement is implicit or explicit. They can give up, by implicit or explicit agreement, their authority to have the PCs drive to other places than the cottage or to pass up the Dark Temple.<br/><br/>Given the lack of player choice in this regard, I would say it's good practice to to skip over the railroady bits in reflection of that agreement, maybe starting the game before the doors of the cottage or the doors of the Temple. Your examples of railroading, then, actually become more of a premise or background. YMMV, of course. Maybe something needs to happen en route to the cottage, or the PCs need to level up or find an item in the Valley before they get to the Dark Temple. The point still stands, that it's not dysfunctional because it's based on agreement and communication. The players have not had their authority taken from them, but they have willingly surrendered parts of it for a greater payoff in fun.<br/><br/>But I would argue that railroading is still problematic when such an agreement does not exist. When the player wants to take the PC elsewhere but the GM won't let them short of leaving the game altogether, forcing them on a rail that the players <i>don't</i> want to be on, then it's a dysfunctional takeover of narrative authority, and more fundamentally a breakdown in communication and common expectations. The different areas of narrative authority are no longer able to coexist in a single fiction, acting as a signal for the deeper underlying problems.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>[Ignoring narration] is done often enough, and is always rooted in bad communication; especially the<i>listening</i>part of it. Listening in on each other is as important as telling the story.</blockquote>\nShort of a social breakdown or some unstated strife, ignoring narration usually seems to be a symptom of carelessness or disorganization. I've seen it most often when all the PCs are talking or acting at once and the GM couldn't keep up. Also when someone just plain isn't concentrating, of course. I've also seen a case where one PC seemed to have gone selectively deaf to another PC's voice register and the player was called out on it. It can also occur across sessions due to good old forgetfulness and a lack of good record keeping. Whatever the cause, it results in narrative fragmentation and contradiction. Usually better organization and resolving underlying social tensions seem to cure it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_310220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310220/#Comment_310220" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T02:45:22+00:00" title="January 31, 2011  2:45AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eldir</cite>Please note that I said crossing narrative authority boundaries is only a problem when there is no agreement:<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: Eldir</cite>What the player without authority may not do, however, is try to wrest the steering wheel away without prior agreement.</blockquote>Yes.<br/><br/>In the case of railroading the narrative authority is already invested with the GM. So generally it may be both used and misused without "prior agreement". I find that railroading is frowned upon if the result is bad, and so it is not so much a "prior agreement" we're talking of here; but a later condoning of the use (or condemning the misuse). <br/><br/>When a GM misuse railroading, it's mostly done from fear; to insulate her from the chaos of player-influence.<br/><br/>So;<br/>- railroading done <b>bad</b> is a way to keep control, on the cost of player investment.<br/>- railroading done <b>good</b> is a way to lead players into "the other focus", serving up new venues of interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310229/#Comment_310229" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T07:01:04+00:00" title="January 31, 2011  7:01AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Scurvy_Platypus</cite>My wife recently tried her hand at GMing for the first time ever (PDQ system). 3 of her 4 players (I was the 4th) were first time gamers (2 of them with theatre background) and the "narative ambush" popped up.

Sorry, I guess I didn't explain it very well. First, my understanding of what was meant by "narrative ambush" was confirmed with this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eldir</cite>I haven't seen a term for it so I made it up, though I may have missed it because I haven't been keeping up with the terminology that well. (In English, at any rate. I usually blog in Korean.) I used it to refer to situations where a participant in the game narrates about a narrative element (usually a character) that they don't have formal authority over, in the absence of mutual agreement or a rule that allows such a takeover. That would be, for instance, a player narrating an NPC's or another player character's actions, or the GM deciding what a PC is doing.<br/><br/>In the example, which is similar to what happened in play a couple of times, Player A narrates something to do with Player B's character and an NPC. Player A has authority over her character Alice, but Player B and the GM have authority over Bob the PC and Charlie the NPC respectively. Thus, Player A is staging an impromptu takeover of narrative authority without an agreement or a rule, something Player B and the GM found jarring.</blockquote>\nSo, it's not that a conflict was defined as "anytime people in the group don't agree on the scene should evolve and who has authority." The PDQ rules expect that the GM has primary authority, with players able to spend a resource in order to exert some explicit authority in the world.<br/><br/>No, what was happening was that a player would grab authority, state that a conflict of some sort had occured, dictate that their character had been successful in that conflict, and then dictate the actions of the losing character.<br/><br/>So my wife's approach was to sort of rewind it back to where she felt the conflict was and go for the Roll The Dice; if the player was successful, then what the player had previously narrated was the result.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think this is all slightly fuzzy. As I understand the OP, basically Jee is saying that the "driver" or person in charge of narrative authority should be left alone and allowed to drive. "Narrative ambush" has been offered up as an example of one way in which this authority is challenged; the conclusion seems to be that narrative ambush is indicative of dysfunctional/problematical play and an indicator for stress/problems within the group.<br/><br/>I don't happen to agree with that and offered by a counter example of the sort of behaviour that I thought Jee was talking about and how it was addressed, not just by an experienced GM or someone that's got any sort of real exposure to rpg theory, but a never-before-in-her-life GM; and the instigator of the narrative ambushing was someone with a fair amount of theatre background (which my wife doesn't have either).<br/><br/>Jason's comment was also sitting in my mind:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I love narrative ambushes. People new to roleplaying games do this consistently and I think that speaks volumes about the ways we build up a weird, syncretic orthodoxy around our hobby.</blockquote>\nMy wife does have a bunch of rpg play experience under her belt, but a fair chunk of it has been in games where the player is expected to have at least some narrative authority.<br/><br/>It's also important I think to distinguish a bit about that narrative authority, because it seems like the way Jee has framed it, there's some in-built assumptions to begin with. One being that people have limited authority in the first place; a player is only in control of their character, and it seems likely that the GM is primarily responsible for NPCs. No real idea who's supposed to have authority over the world, but usually that falls in the GM's lap as well.<br/><br/>My observation of new RPG players is that frequently they've no concept that simply dictating facts about the world, NPC actions, etc is "wrong". Often they don't even see it as a problem when they dictate the behaviour of another character.<br/><br/>Actors (or at least actors new to rpgs) are an interesting side case, because while they're certainly familiar with having a character, when someone tells them that their character does something, they usually don't immediately resist; instead, since they've framed an rpg game as something like an extended and/or guided session of improv, they try ti figure out _why_ their character would have done that. Based on what they know of the character, this either means there's something about the character they didn't know/think about, or that they were looking at the character the wrong way, or even that from a pure character perspective it might not work but from a story/performance perspective it's awesome and their idea of the character should shift for that soet of thing to happen.<br/><br/>Basically, the actor/performer new to rpgs tends to view/react to a narrative ambush as an opportunity or a challenge and works to try and weave the new thread into the ongoing tale. Newer players usually aren't as refined in their approaches, but also seem to exhibit similar tendencies.<br/><br/>At least, until they've been "properly taught" how to do things.<br/><br/>And that's where my earlier comment about dysfunctional communication ties in. People are taught what's acceptable to do in order to achieve their goals/desires. My wife was teaching them what was acceptable in terms of how much a character could achieve in a single "step" in a character trying to achieve their goals. And many (one would hope most) actors know all about conflicts arising because of agents in a scene having different goals and trying to achieve them.<br/><br/>Where dysfunction occurs (at least partially) is when people (players or the GM) insist on trying to achieve their goals in a manner that's not compatible with other people, and/or when they have goals that aren't merely different but perhaps even in opposition to other members of the group.<br/><br/>But as this point I feel like stuff is headed into territory that been long and often discussed in all kinds of theory threads and others.<br/><br/>So..... Yeah.... Not quite sure what else to say. What Jee seems to view as a problem, or at least as something potentially indicative of a larger problem, is from my perspective not really an issue at all. Or perhaps it's more accurate to say, "it doesn't actually have to be a problem or mean that there is a problem".<br/><br/>Does that make more sense? My understanding coukd be completely flawed and I'll be the first to admit that I've only paid attention to the rpg theory that seemed useful to me; so I could be all kinds of wrong somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
