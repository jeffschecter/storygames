I don't know what went down behind the scenes but it was painful to witness. I feel lucky that I didn't have any problems.<br/><br/>What can we do to make sure it doesn't happen again? Michael Miller, who worked hard at damage control during the show,  has some thoughts <a href="http://stalwart1000.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/origins-2010-chaos-incarnate/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>One thing I really missed was a dedicated games on demand area, or even an informal place to hang out and make matches. It seemed like a lot of that was happening electronically, via twitter or by phone. At a physical event where there are real people to talk to, that seems less than optimal. Thoughts? Ideas? Can we work with Origins to help them? Should we route around Origins to help ourselves?

So, for many of the top brass, this was their first year on the job, or the first year in their current posistion.</li>\n<li>I heard a number of volunteers complain about the "new database software." It seems that this was the first year for the program they track events, sell badges, sell tickets, etc. So, not only were they dealing with bugs in the software itself, but a group of volunteers who were unfamiliar with it.</li>\n<li>This was the first year since the convention center was remodeled. Previously, the breezeway was THE open gaming area, with a few dozen tables. It was exactly the kind of "hang out and make matches" place you mention. Now, the remodeled breezeway is a loitering-unfriendly wasteland, and open gaming was shunted off to a remote exhibit hall.</li>\n<li>It seemed that a lot of information on updates, schedule revisions, etc. existed, but had a tough time filtering down the the level of "volunteer that would actually speak with people."</li>\n<li>I heard a rumor that a number of experienced volunteers did not return, and thus many of the volunteers and especially senior volunteers/supervisors were also new.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278494/#Comment_278494" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T08:22:18+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  8:22AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say work with Origins.

My one friend volunteered for them, and his job one day was just to stand outside their area, talk to people, hand out flyers and try to entice them in for a demo.<br/><br/>Looney Labs also carefully tracks tickets and generic tokens, because that's part of how GAMA decides how important your group is.  More tickets for GAMA=more support from Origins.<br/><br/>Looney Labs has a year round email list for volunteers and started drumming up volunteers for Origins before GAMA did (and had volunteer schedules worked out sooner as well).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Things that Looney Labs does that can only help draw people in: branding.  Looney Labs has their own area, with lots of identifying signage and distinct visual aesthetics. (Person in lab coat plus tie dye = Looney Labs volunteer.) Everyone could identify them at a glance.  <br/><br/>They also are very consistently open and friendly and welcoming (again, one guy's job is nothing but being open and inviting.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278544/#Comment_278544" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T11:32:57+00:00" title="June 29, 2010 11:32AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>Maybe if Luke and Jared made a bigger deal next time of Parsely activities and that other big social game thing?<br/></blockquote>\nAction Castle was off in the Larp basement, which was less than ideal.  It really seems like it could benefit from being in a very public space: dudes walk by, here "Take branch" and remember the glory days of Infocom.  They come over and start throwing in suggestions, and play and are hooked.<br/><br/><br/>Initially, Are You A Werewolf was played out in the hallways, near the Looney Labs stuff.  This was because we couldn't fit groups of 30+ people in the Lab (then much smaller).  Werewolf would get a lot of people wandering by at midnight after a game ended but before they wanted to sleep.  They'd come and play a game or two and then be hooked.<br/><br/>It's now been moved to boardgaming, where it's fairly visible to the boardgamers but not so much to anyone else walking by.<br/><br/><br/>Parsely games are inherently more limited than Werewolf, though.  I've played Action Castle once and bowed out of playing it a second time.  I've played dozens of games of Werewolf but keep finding it compelling and fun.  You'd need to be able to funnel people from Parsely off to other games if that was the strategy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278553/#Comment_278553" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T12:16:37+00:00" title="June 29, 2010 12:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like all these ideas.

Most of teh attendees of the War College have ribbons so there is not much (if any) ticket collection. I do a lecture for the college every year and have to say they are actually nice guys - largely old time wargamers. They had a meeting at the end of the con discussing practically the same things talked about here so don't write them off completely!<br/><br/>I ran all my games through Rogue Judges - a GM collective of Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Ohioan gamers. I work with them at Gen Con as well. They submit their games as a group and get a few priviledges because of that. They have an area dedicated to them (though it is in the farthest hall - one hall beyond where the open gaming area was). At Gen Con they have a nice local in the Convention Center. In the past I hooked up with Interest Group Milwaukee who did the same thing when Gen Con was up there. What I'm getting at is that Conventions like dealing with collectives. Organizations that can guarentee games (ie generate ticket sales) get attention. That is all that Looney Labs is doing - or the Mayfair gaming area for that matter, having company sponcership helps of course. If you don't submitt games collectively you get shunted off to the Hotels - far away from the center of the con.<br/><br/>So I urge us to form an organization and submit games together. First contact GAMA and ask how they want this done. They will negociate - just don't expect to get the best area the first year. Can we get any big names to be part of it? The more the better. <br/><br/>This is so totally doable. I'd certainly run a couple of games through it - not to mention the free badges and if you run enough games free hotel rooms. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278581/#Comment_278581" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T13:53:09+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  1:53PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Chris.

I'm talking absolutely no support. It ended up generating a two-hour bitch session with about 20 media reps and one poor GAMA rep last year.<br/><br/>This year GAMA made up for that and then some. They took all of the complaints and concerns and suggestions we gave them and made a tremendous effort to help all of us out, whether mainline media, bloggers, podcasters, etc. Even with a few bumps in the road, it was one of the best treatments of the press I've seen from any group in many years. <br/><br/>So I do think we've got some good people working in GAMA right now who are really wanting to make improvements.

I do think that the solution to getting a GoD going at Origins is to pitch it to GAMA as a block of events, in much the way it's done at GenCon. Present them with a good, solid program that includes some scheduled indie RPG events and a dedicated slate of GoD events, and I think it shouldn't be a huge problem getting us a room of our own, and that's so where near 90% of the battle. As long as we emphasize the importance of actually collecting tics for games we run there and then make sure to have someone whose job it is to follow up and get them in, it could become a staple event pretty quickly.<br/><br/>I'm not at all above calling in whatever favors I may have earned over the years to try and help this happen, assuming we can get together and properly organize and lobby for it. Stressing the number of ENNIE and <i>especially</i> Origins Award-winning games are represented by the bloc will only help!<br/><br/>As others have said, this was very much a 'rebuilding' year for the org, and I think that they'll be particularly receptive in the coming year to any ideas that help them reach out to new markets and especially younger and more 'net-savvy gamers.<br/><br/>So let's make sure to keep this a front-burner thing and start working on it as soon as GC is in the can; they start planning for the following year as soon as the old show ends, so we want to get rolling on any initiative ASAP.<br/><br/>Maybe this is something to start a separate planning thread for? I'd also welcome any semi-organized discussion we can manage at GenCon.<br/><br/>-Jim Crocker, retailer and story-game fanboy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282030/#Comment_282030" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T04:28:35+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  4:28AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jim!
