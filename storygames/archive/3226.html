I would be interested in your opinion about this game.<br/><br/>(I would appreciate even a playtest, but be warned: it is in the early phases, there are no actual NPCs, etc. to use. Even NPC-creating must be tested.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
