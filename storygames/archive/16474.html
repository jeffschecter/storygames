I'm starting this thread to think about how this might work and to appeal to the Story Games Hive Mind for inspiration.</p>\n<h3>The 8-Ball Itself</h3>\n<p>The Magic 8-Ball is basically a d20 with a distinct "answer" on each face. There are 10 positive results, 5 negative, and 5 uncertain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style="color: green;">It is certain</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: green;">It is decidedly so</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: green;">Without a doubt</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: green;">Yes \u2013 definitely</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: green;">You may rely on it</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: green;">As I see it, yes</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: green;">Most likely</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: green;">Outlook good</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: green;">Yes</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: green;">Signs point to yes</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: blue;">Reply hazy, try again</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: blue;">Ask again later</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: blue;">Better not tell you now</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: blue;">Cannot predict now</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: blue;">Concentrate and ask again</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: red;">Don't count on it</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: red;">My reply is no</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: red;">My sources say no</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: red;">Outlook not so good</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: red;">Very doubtful</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Asking Questions</h3>\n<p>So... seems like if I'm going to use the 8-Ball, I need to think about using questions to frame whatever activity is being resolved.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm swinging my sword at the goblin. <em>Do I kill him?</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>or</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I need to find some unobtainium to fuel my Doomsday Device. <em>Is it in the laboratory?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>or even</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Will Mary Sue go out to dinner with me?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the central design challenges I see is determining and communicating how to appropriately scope the questions.</p>\n<h3>Getting Answers</h3>\n<p><strong>Yes:</strong> Out of the box, the Magic 8-Ball is heavily weighted toward success, which I find problematic as I'm very much in the camp that values interesting failure. I can see using the slight shading in the answers to provide a bit more graininess, but I'm not sure where to go.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask Again:</strong> These results <em>are</em> interesting to me - I can see using them to introduce complication (analogous to 7-9 in AW), or to extend the conflict. </p>\n<p><strong>No:</strong> Interestingly, the "No" answers are all slightly hedged, whereas the "Yes" answers are mostly definitive. Don't know what this means to me yet.</p>\n<h3>So...</h3>\n<p>Before I continue rambling, I'd like to appeal for some of SG's trademark thoughtfulness, wackiness, or whatever. Does this seem worth pursuing? Has someone already done this? Any suggestions or ideas?</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376964/#Comment_376964" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T12:18:51+00:00" title="May  7, 2012 12:18PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2012 1:29PM by David Artman.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see a slightly different "relative scale" than suggested by your list above, to whit:<br/><br/><b>100% Yes</b><br/>Yes \u2013 definitely<br/>Yes<br/><br/><b>Yes, but with suspiciously excessive verbiage</b><br/>It is certain<br/>It is decidedly so<br/>Without a doubt<br/>You may rely on it<br/><br/><b>Yes, but without perfect knowledge (i.e., opinion, likelihood)</b><br/>As I see it, yes<br/>Most likely<br/>Outlook good<br/>Signs point to yes<br/><br/><b>Stalling</b><br/>Reply hazy, try again<br/>Ask again later<br/><br/><b>Stalling, but with suspiciously excessive verbiage</b><br/>Better not tell you now<br/>Cannot predict now<br/><br/><b>Stalling, but blaming the questioner (!)</b><br/>Concentrate and ask again<br/><br/><b>No, but without perfect knowledge (i.e., opinion, likelihood)</b><br/>My sources say no<br/>Outlook not so good<br/>Very doubtful<br/><br/><b>No, but with suspiciously excessive verbiage</b><br/>Don't count on it<br/>My reply is no<br/><br/><b>100% No</b><br/>...

I think it was a game chef, or maybe the "little game chef" contest. It was the one that had starfish as one of the components.<br/><br/>The ball is a great tool, and while I was focusing on it as a ritualistic device for determining the origins of mysterious artefacts, I had some great ideas at the time for using it as a proper resolution method. (So much, that I included the ball as an "Infinite Oracle" [an eight on it's side being an infinity symbol] for my goblin tarot deck.)<br/><br/>Around this time, I also wrote some posts on my blog about the potential for the magic eight ball. <a href="http://vulpinoid.blogspot.com.au/2010/07/unexploited-resource-3-magic-eight-ball.html" rel="nofollow">--&gt; here &lt;--&lt;/a&gt;<br/><br/>I'd love to see a few more designers explore it's potential.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377065/#Comment_377065" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T20:14:46+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  8:14PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2012 8:15PM by zircher.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The skill/risk is in the question you ask.

It's just a rough idea so far, and this is far from being "game text" that includes all of the cues and clues that would be needed for use in actual play, but it's a start. Breaking this up into two posts for readability's sake.</p>\n<p>I envision this as a existing alongside a task-level resolution system, providing players the opportunity to move from "task resolution" to "conflict resolution" in a flavorful way. For purposes of this post, it doesn't really matter what the more fine-grained mechanic is, just that it exists. I'm also assuming a GM-ed game.</p>\n<p>Each non-GM player has 2 "Oracle tokens" per session, and the GM has a number of tokens equal to the number of other players +1.</p>\n<h3>Consulting the Oracle</h3>\n<p>At any point during play, even during a scene where the task-level mechanic is already being used, players may choose to Consult the Oracle. When a player wishes to engage the oracle mechanic, she spends an Oracle token, takes the Magic 8-Ball in her hand and raises it so that it is in view of all the players at the table, saying, "It is time - I shall Consult the Oracle." She then asks her question, then shakes the 8-Ball and reads out the answer.</p>\n<h3>Asking The Question</h3>\n<p>If all of the non-GM players choose to spend an Oracle token, the initial player may frame a question that impacts the group as a whole. Otherwise, the question must relate only to the questioner.</p>\n<p>Questions should be in the future tense, and the scope of the question should be appropriate to the scope of the "conflict" at hand. The question should also allow for negative outcomes that don't "shut down" the joint story.</p>\n<p>So, if the character is holding initial negotiations with Count Froderik to build a business relationship, an appropriate question might be:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Will Count Froderik allow me to move my goods across his land in exchange for a small cut of the profits?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, if the characters are engaged in a skirmish with a goblin raiding party, the question might be:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Will we defeat these goblins without taking serious harm?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, each group will determine what sorts of questions work best for them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377315/#Comment_377315" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T11:54:54+00:00" title="May  9, 2012 11:54AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2012 12:14PM by WPTunes.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h3>Interpreting the Oracle</h3>\n<p>Some of the Oracle's responses are clearly just "Yes".</p>\n<p><strong>If the answer is "Yes" or "Yes - definitely"</strong> then the questioner describes the outcome.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>"Sir Froderik hems and haws, and consults with his advisors, but eventually comes to a decision.
