This is crazy, in a good, good way. I want to play this.<br/><br/>So help me! Who's played it? What do I need to do up-front to ensure the game plays well? I've read <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1100&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> started by Mathijs, and it seems there's some work to be done that's not really in the text (which I understood from reading it; I could see that people would have to talk about character and setting beforehand).<br/><br/>Shreyas, in that thread you mention that John Kim came up with some tools for the game; I can't find anything about it over on darkshire. Could you point me to it?<br/><br/>There's a part of me that wants to put this on the docket for Go Play NW and facilitate it, but I have to admit the gestures are still intimidating. It's a lot of front-loading of knowledge for people to buy into. Can you see this working as a con game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205065/#Comment_205065" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T16:14:22+00:00" title="May  3, 2009  4:14PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think the stuff I referred to might have been on his blog.

Back before GenCon 2006, we even had plans to demo Mridangam, if you can imagine that!<br/><br/>Basically, you'd tape out a map of the temple on the floor and boil down the hand gestures to the basics of "threaten (thing)" + 3-4 different "response" gestures.  Maybe there could be a different "threaten" gesture for physical, mental, and social still (3, as opposed to 15 or whatever).  And the specific "thing" being threatened might have to be implied in the performance.  Such as "threaten (social): Oh, what a beautiful daughter you have, Rashyana!"  Does the dancer plan to seduce the daughter away or corrupt her against her father or use her to embarrass Rashyana in public?  Who knows!  Doesn't really matter when you're throwing gestures; it's only decided for sure once the gesture negotiation is finished and the scene plays out.<br/><br/>Anyway, I might do something like that.  What do you think, Shreyas?<br/><br/>P.S. For interested folks, Mridangam is a game based on classical Indian dance that Shreyas wrote for <a href="http://plays-well.com/push1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Push 1</a> (PDF).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205073/#Comment_205073" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T17:06:13+00:00" title="May  3, 2009  5:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think that's a pretty good idea for simplification.

I wasn't getting that from the text, but it was probably one of those intentionally-left-out things that Mathijs ran into.<br/><br/>As an aside, to Jonathan: I also read "Waiting for the Queen/Tea at Midnight" today, and I am so totally doing that at GPNW. I love the constrained-steps nature to the mechanics, plus I'm not intimidated by it and can grab one other person in an off-slot and play it.
