My current plans are:<br/><br/>pitch for 4 players (plus me) - would like to go with 5 but think it could be tricky to keep all 5 involved if I do<br/><br/>make a bunch of pregens, with world-stuff implied in them; let players pick from them, rip them apart, or mix-and-match; I know chargen is really quick but it carries a high risk of paralysis is a convention environment.<br/><br/>bring a big old map of a pulp continent (maybe the one of <a href="http://sorcererundermountain.d101games.com/files/2011/03/Continent-of-Terror-by-john-ossoway.jpg" rel="nofollow">Zarth</a> from Crypts &amp; Things) and a couple of threads from stuff on the map<br/><br/>And then let it run... I've got 3 hours, and it's first (Saturday morning) game of the con... any more best practice advice? The game looks to me to be really con/one-shot friendly.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441038/#Comment_441038" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-25T16:09:56+00:00" title="December 25, 2014  4:09PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's super one shot friendly!<br/><br/>Overplayer plus three Rogues is, in my opinion, the best mix - especially if time is limited. On that note, you may have to be the one to write down the first few Threads; new players are timorous to do so or tend to forget they can. When the whole table goes "oh!" you can also indicate that someone else should write the awe-inspiring detail down.<br/><br/>I would reconsider using pre-gens. Chargen is super fast and gives the players a taste of the authorial stance and narrative authority they're going to have during the game. If you're worried about paralysis you can write out some tasty samples of Things That Deserve a Name on index cards and spread them around the table. That's a good crutch for people who get stuck but won't force those who feel ready to use characters they aren't invested in.<br/><br/>Good luck and let us know how it goes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441040/#Comment_441040" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-26T03:00:55+00:00" title="December 26, 2014  3:00AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first time I played Swords was at a con. It worked really well, I thought. We ended up with 5 players and an Overplayer, did full character creation, and fit comfortably in our timeslot (which I think was four hours). I'm really glad we got to do the full character creation. There was a little bit of paralysis from some players at the beginning, especially over choosing the eidolons (providing some cool fantasy art is key), but our Overplayer kept us pretty focused and moved things along. He also saved the choosing a trick portion of character creation until after we'd played through one of each phase. This meant most of us didn't get to use our Trick in play, but also meant we understood what most of the tricks did in a way we wouldn't have at the beginning. I've just introduced Swords to my home group and meant to do the same thing, but then totally forgot to go back and introduce the Tricks 'tall. D'oh.<br/><br/>Modeling the writing of Motifs is very good advice.<br/><br/>With that many players, a couple of the stories did seem a little peripheral to the main action, so yeah, I think three or four is a better bet (I've had five-six players in my home game and it has gone two short sessions so far, not ideal but everyone's been enjoying the game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441044/#Comment_441044" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-26T20:10:05+00:00" title="December 26, 2014  8:10PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2014 8:20PM by Tulpa.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'll third not using pre-gens. The pre-written Things that deserve a name is a good idea, as well as a genre-appropriate namelist for when people struggle to name things. Most importantly, bring your own Eidolons &amp; Simulacra! People don't tend to carry evocative objects to inspire swords and sorcery adventures with them. Just a deck of fantasy art cards would do well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441047/#Comment_441047" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-28T06:12:12+00:00" title="December 28, 2014  6:12AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Swords can run top to bottom, 4 players + overplayer, with character generation, in 2 hours. (last time I did a con game, it was 90 minutes) That's actually a really good target to hit: it'll keep you on point with your explanations, and keeping chargen moving.<br/><br/>(I'd totally avoid five: it's just a little bit too much tension on telling a good story and keeping everybody involved.)<br/><br/>Chargen is really really fast....except two parts:<br/>1) Eidolons: bring art, lots of art, either cards/paper, or a slideshow you can go throw on your tablet, or sheet<br/>2) Tricks: they're spread out in inconvenient places, and they don't really matter super much. Pick a few, give them as the only options, keep the other ones by the side.<br/><br/>Then just run the game, with a firm hand on the pacing, and filling those cards.<br/><br/>And when you're done in two hours (or slightly over), if you're in a four hour slot, then you get to play another adventure!<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441049/#Comment_441049" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-28T10:15:51+00:00" title="December 28, 2014 10:15AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, over at the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/104194230537983273846" rel="nofollow">Google Plus SWM community</a> you can find links to handouts with all the tricks in one place, and more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
