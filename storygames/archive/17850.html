It's an annotated collection of his nonfiction articles.<br/><br/>Here's a little bit from a piece he wrote in 2000:<br/><br/>"Artistic collaboration is a profoundly strange business.  Do it right up to the hilt, as it were, and you and your partner will generate a third party.  Some thoroughly other.  And often one capable of things neither you nor the very reasonable gentleman seated opposite would even begin to consider.  Who...is the third who walks beside us?"<br/><br/>That really struck me as something.  I've felt that.  I studied studio art for a couple years in college and had some profound collaborative experiences in that context.  I've also made art with my wife and our <i>third</i> isn't very expressive of a distinct personality, but we definitely have a synergy and it's great.<br/><br/>But what about gaming?  I think there's at least a little <i>third</i> in any of these games we play around here.  The place that I've seen it most strongly -- sometimes startlingly, is playing Universalis.  Uni doesn't provide me with the most 'fun' of any game, but the emergence of this <i>third</i> happens so quickly and so ubiquitously that it's a thing to behold and this game occupies a special place in my mind because of it.<br/><br/>Does this notion of the third -- the synergy between players (artists?) expressing it's own personality; does that resonate with you?  What do you think about it?  When do you feel it most?  Least?  Is it always welcome?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403978/#Comment_403978" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T08:37:42+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  8:37AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played Universalis, but I've noticed a similar experience in other games without a GM -- Polaris and Archipelago II for sure seemed to take on a life of their own. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403980/#Comment_403980" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T08:58:02+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  8:58AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel that experience most often in lightly structured collaborative games, like Silver &amp; White, My Daughter Queen of France, etc. It's the thing that comes out of the fruitful void, sometimes, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403983/#Comment_403983" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T09:14:59+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  9:14AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2013 9:15AM by Rickard.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...but the <b>emergence</b> of this <i>third</i> happens...</blockquote>\nWhat I emphased is what happened. When several parts of a system interact, it gives a result  - emergence - that can be hard to predict.<br/><br/>I got a thing when a <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2" rel="nofollow">fish tank</a> scenario of mine (when I was a GM) came to life. It felt like it was playing itself - all I could do was to tag along and let the players know how the scenario responded on their actions. I know writers can feel the same thing, when the characters seem to come to life in their writings. Is this similar to what you wrote? I'm not sure I understood the whole thing right. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403985/#Comment_403985" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T09:20:27+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  9:20AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2013 9:24AM by WarriorMonk.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it's exactly the same feeling when you can't come up with a solution for something, and then a random everyday ocurrence makes it all click in your mind. It's like it isn't your own idea at first, so you can't help to be surprised by all the implications this new idea brings into the problem and how it solves many more issues you still hadn't foreseen up until now. No wonder people keep referring to this as a third person...<br/><br/>Edit: First thing you need in order to experience this is to be willing to contribute your creativity to a project, ans at the same time totally let go of owning anything about the results. Whenever more than one person is in this state, unafraid of taking what others bring into the project, just saying "yes and..." by limiting themselves to push the snowball, the third appears. And it's fearsome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404009/#Comment_404009" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T14:58:03+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  2:58PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of people describe immersion this way, where the third is their character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404505/#Comment_404505" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T05:50:55+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  5:50AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first band I played in, sometimes when we went for a break I'd look around for the last member as we left the room.
