It was manned by Josh Roby and Paul Tevis.  So I wandered over to chat with them for a bit.  We traded updates about who was at con, and what was going on and all.  And after a moment, I realized that, hey, there were all these books, mostly digest format, some of them with titles I recognized.  A few with names on the cover of people I've met.  So I took a moment to look over the stock.<br/><br/>And I missed something.  That little jump, that excitement about new ideas and games, and being able to hold and skim games I've only heard things about on line.  There's <i>Steal Away Jordan</i> on one end, and <i>In A Wicked Age</i> on another.  <i>Passages</i> kinda in the middle.  I knew that I expected to be just a little jazzed over the sheer <em>potential</em> at that table.  That at least one of those games would have some shining gem in it.  Or that the praise I've heard about one of these games is really justified.<br/><br/>It wasn't there.  And I missed it, the way you might miss a favorite cousin who couldn't make the family reunion.  I'm still trying to figure out where it went.  I've got some ideas, but I'm still chewing them over.  But the regretful fact remains:<br/><br/>I looked at a table full of new games, and I wasn't excited.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128085/#Comment_128085" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T13:11:12+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  1:11PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome to the jaded adolescence of indie roleplaying.

I know you and I look for very different things in a game, so I'm curious as to where your disappointment was focused.  Subject matter?  Execution?  Do you just feel jaded?<br/><br/>To some extent I agree with CK's recent post in that genre approaches don't really jazz me anymore.  For Swords &amp; Sorcery fantasy gaming I'm quite happy with Sorcerer + Sorcerer &amp; Sword.  In a Wicked Age... interests me pretty much because a) I trust Vincent and b) the pick-up aspect of it since Sorcerer &amp; Sword is a little hard to play on the fly.  And weird genre combos leave me cold, "It's NOIR but with FAIRIES!" unless there's some very specific underlying take beyond the color mash up alone.<br/><br/>But in the last year there HAVE been games that jazz me.<br/><br/>Spione &amp; Dirty Secrets are two games that I feel have finally done two particular genres the "right way" in which no other RPG has in the past.<br/>Grey Ranks and It Was A Mutual Decision - Personally this is where I want design to go.  Highly specific situations with highly specific structures and mechanics for addressing a particular set of issues inherent to that situation. <br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128093/#Comment_128093" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T13:17:40+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  1:17PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really?

Now, I'm not as much (unless something catches me off-guard).<br/><br/>Last year at GenCon, frex, I wasn't excited by a lot of stuff that I saw here and there at the various small press booths (I already owned a lot of it, mind). And yet, I found some truly awesome things that kicked me in the nuts:<br/>The Dragons of Kir (a board game)<br/>Colonial Gothic (Vampires and Cthulhu during the American Revolution)<br/>Dirty Secrets (Fulfilling!)<br/>there were one or two others that I forget now (and I was half-and-half on Solomon Kane).<br/><br/>I could have said, "Damn, GC was disappointing, because the only New Things that excited me were two RPGs and a board game!", but instead I just focused on the stuff that excited me. Like, those above games.<br/>And, and this is the BIG PART, all those awesome sessions I got to play and people I got to meet at the Games on Demand booth and after hours. Holy shit that was worth the trip to GenCon, not the swag or product.<br/><br/>You'll learn to get through being jaded, as Jonathan said.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd think there'd be a problem if you were always excited about Everything, All the Time.<br/><br/>BTW, to that end, how about the rest of the con? Did THAT make you excited?

I took an arbitrary 2nd place in a Container tournament that I got randomly seconded into.  I played a rockin' game of Roanoke with a bunch of cool people, including two girls who were still younger than me if you added their ages together.<br/><br/>It's a different thing, though.  If you don't mind me chewing it over in public a bit, part of what struck me was this: I saw <i>In A Wicked Age</i> on the table.  I thought to myself, "huh, I remember reading Vincent's notes on <tt>anyway</tt> - and there's been huge buzz about it."  Then I moved on.  I didn't open the book until someone at the con said "here, look at this," and handed it to me.  I wasn't impressed with the book as an artifact, or as a text, based on a whole five minutes inspection.<br/><br/>I think that disjoint between expectation and fulfillment is becoming more common for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128139/#Comment_128139" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T14:49:38+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  2:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 2:49PM by Jarrod.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Sounds like it is time for you to design a game, then.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Am I allowed to say that?</blockquote>Absolutely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Laura%20Bishop" title="Laura Bishop"><img alt="Laura Bishop" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/433/nKL1G7M6ODYGZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Laura%20Bishop">Laura Bishop</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128140/#Comment_128140" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T14:51:10+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  2:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>I looked at a table full of new games, and I wasn't excited.</blockquote>\nSounds like it is time for you to design a game, then.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Am I allowed to say that?<br/><br/>This is what Jesse said to me when I was trying to explain I was still okay with working within a "broken" game system to tell the stories I wanted to tell in that world.

It goes like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago there was the great suckage.  We owned tons of games, they sucked.  We played tons of games, they sucked.  We eagerly anticipated the release of the next big thing -- only to find that when it finally came out, it sucked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen came the indie game explosion.  The indie games were not the suck...they were actually &lt;gasp&gt; good.  And OMG we had real fun playing them.  And the margin of difference between what we'd found and what we'd been used to was huge...HUGE.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so every GenCon every new Hawtness became like a celebration because that margin was so large it left our feet thumping rapidly like Thumper the bunny in excitement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now we've had indie game goodness for many-a-year.  Now our game shelves are full of goodness.  Now our play is fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the margin between what we find and what we're used to is not so large...because what we're used to...ain't so bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReally Good only seems like ohmygoshfuckingamazingsuperkewlpraisejesus in comparison to the Before Time.  In comparison to what we've all been playing for the last several years...Really Good, is just...Really Good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn't strike me as something to be depressed about.

Why is no one even entertaining the possibility that there might be a problem?<br><br>From where I sit... look, it's not even that the "indie movement" is losing steam or that the relative difference in turning over new ground is diminishing as the number of quality games increases.  There have been a number of games released that are little more than superficial refacing of the old standbys like <em>PTA</em>, with maybe a little color splashed in and a slightly different resource economy that ends up doing the same thing as Fan Mail, except only not quite as well.<br><br>We are taking less time editing our games.  We are taking less time <em>writing</em> our games (hello, <em>In a Wicked Age!</em>).  We are getting less frequent and more insular playtests.  Used to be games were the product of years of work; now they start at Game Chef in the spring and are turned into print products by GenCon.  Maybe, if you're lucky, the designer skips a GenCon and thus puts a whole what, sixteen months into the product?  And nobody seems to be willing to recognize that these changes in the production cycle have consequences for the final product.<br><br>Here, I'll end on a positive note: you know what makes me happy?  <em>Galactic</em> is not in print.  And it's not in print because Matt isn't satisfied with how it plays.  I played <em>Business Solutions</em> like what, over a year ago, now?  Jason's still tinkering with it to get it just right.  Hell, <em>Doctor Chaos</em> got shelved when it became clear to Ron that the project wasn't going to work the way he wanted.  The measure of the integrity of publishers isn't what they print, it's what they <em>don't</em> print.  A little more integrity, and a lot more honest self-appraisal, would do this community a great deal of good.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128190/#Comment_128190" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T17:08:22+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  5:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My vote for what to do about jadedness mirrors what I'm doing in my own life:  Play more.

I gave it a lot of consideration, in fact. But I don't agree with your assessment. You see superficial refacings of PTA and games rushed into print, while I see a crop of stellar games in the past year that offer up all kinds of wonderful, new gaming experiences.<br><br/>I'm not being dismissive when I offer a counterpoint to Judson's ennui, I'm just offering a different viewpoint. It's not that I'm failing to see a bunch of "obviously" mediocre games. It's that my value judgment of games might be different than yours (or anyone's). To take one concrete example, you think Wicked needed more writing time. I think it is <i>beautifully</i> written. It's a spartan style that I find very appealing, in fact.<br/><br/>So yeah. I'm saying, "I see a crop of fantastic games that make me very excited." That's my honest assessment, taking into account the warts and all.<br/><br/>EDIT: And to put this in a slightly different way:<br/><br/>My hobby is not buying and reading awesome game books. My hobby is playing awesome game sessions. For some people, getting some errata off a website to add to a game book in order to play it better equals a massive failure of the game. For me, it's a negligible inconvenience that then allows me to have awesome game sessions, so I never give it a second thought. Like, as a book and game designer, I'm very happy that Shock: 1.1 is easier to understand (as a book) than Shock: 1.0. But as a player of the game, it has no impact on me at all. My sessions were really, really fun in either case. That's the sum total of what I want out of this hobby, as a hobbyist and consumer.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128193/#Comment_128193" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T17:18:09+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  5:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua: What is that viewpoint based on?

This is not bluster unaccompanied by action.<br/><br/>Ben, the opening line of <em>IAWA</em> is "Somebody pick an oracle."  It doesn't explain what an oracle is or where to find it, just plows on through.  Whether or not the game is <em>well-designed</em>, that's crappy instructions.  The whole thing reads, not like a book or instructions for a game, but like Vincent's notes on how the game is played.<br/><br/>And Justin, yes, <em>of course</em> there are some good books being produced.  I mean, I'm the one who released his newest last weekend; I should hope it's good!  I spent a ton of time and effort and care, and yadda yadda yadda -- but whether or not it is good isn't really an assessment I make in the end, is it?  I know what went into it; that's a very different thing than what comes out the other end.  And I know you put a ton of work into <em>Passages</em>, and in truth I was counting it in the "proven designs of yesteryear" category along with <em>PTA</em> and <em>Dogs</em>, which were also on the table.  On the other hand, though, even you've recognized that <em>something</em> went wrong, or at least non-optimal, in marketing the book considering the cool reception that it has received.<br/><br/>Now, folks may have considered the question seriously like John did, and come to a different assessment than I have.  But what gets posted here is not the serious consideration, it's the reassuring conclusion.  Over and over and over again.  I've no doubt that individuals like John or Ben may have a rosier outlook on the progress of indie gaming; what disturbs me is the utter lack of dissenting voices of criticism.  When everybody keeps nodding their head in unison like a cult, you start to wonder if they're all cult members.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128213/#Comment_128213" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T18:35:57+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  6:35PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Where've you been?

Over the last little bit, I've been trying to unpack why.<br/><br/>The first reason is easy: the games I was excited about last year, I bought.<br/><br/>The second reason, though, cuts at the heart of our community:  it's hard to get excited when I can't trust the opinions of anyone here.  I read comments about how great IAWA is, or how great Play Unsafe is, and I have to wonder if I'm the only guy in the room that sees the white rhino in the room tearing stuff up.  Frankly, I'm at the point where I'm done buying bad book after bad book and watching people here talk about how amazing these books are.  (To be more clear: I'm not talking about these as games, but as books -- communicators of ideas -- that people ask money for.)  I just don't trust the opinions here of anyone anymore.  There's no sense of objectivity.  The thing that I have to wonder is: maybe there never was, and I'm just kidding myself to think that.<br/><br/>So, when half the books I own copies of and the other half I now am trained, by circumstance, to view with distrust and suspicion, I have to say that I'm lamenting the loss of that same feeling that Judson is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128218/#Comment_128218" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T18:56:06+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  6:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To jump off of what Josh said above, In a Wicked Age may be a seriously cool game, but I don't know because I haven't played it yet. And that's the crux of my dissatisfaction with the current crop of indie games. You've got to play it and see, because there's a heck of a lot stuff that aren't these books. They may be fantastic designs, but they're weak as books.<br/><br/>(I picked In a Wicked Age... to demonstrate my point not to pillory it, but because it stands in stark contrast to Dogs in the Vineyard, which is the exemplar of how to put together a game text. Also, I give Vincent props for pricing IaWA appropriately; I'll gladly pay $12 for the design.)<br/><br/>I'll name names here, too: Steal Away Jordan, Shock:, Mortal Coil; these are all games where I've heard interviews with their designers in which they said something vitally important to understanding the game that isn't in the book. (To a lesser extent, this is true of Burning Empires as well.) And while it's great that I've eventually been able to discover what it is, that's really disappointing.<br/><br/>Why is this a problem? Let's look at an example from the world of board games: Reiner Knizia's Ra. It's tremendously good auction game. Maybe the best one out there, and certainly my favorite. The problem: the rules only tell you the rules. They don't tell you how to play. And because auction games are utterly dependent on what the other people at the table do, initial play experiences are wildly divergent. Lots of folks play it once and give up. They never the strategy of the game, the "how" of how to play it. And that's sad, because the design is so good.<br/><br/>To be very clear: I'm not displeased with the state of design in the community. I'm displeased with the state of development. I used to work for a software company that I described as "building great technology, but terrible products." We solved amazingly hard problems. . . and then made it nearly impossible for our customers to figure out how to use the tools we'd built. I'm worried that the games I mentioned above, and lack of critical responses to them as texts, indicates we're heading down that road. We've spent a lot of time focusing on design, and relatively little attention has been paid to the problem of putting together a product. As result, I feel like we've gone backwards. That isn't to say that there aren't great products coming out of the community (Dogs in the Vineyard, Spirit of the Century, and Sons of Liberty come to mind), but when people talk about us as "designers designing for other designers," the books I've mentioned help me understand why that perception exists.

I played IAWA Sunday night and it not a very satisfying experience.  I was explained the game by the GM.  That's fortunate, because if I had been forced to figure out the game by reading the text and not had access to somebody who already knew how to play I don't think I would have bothered.  I haven\u2019t seen any feedback from anybody who has (if there is please link me).  I don't think being able to understand the game from just reading the text is an unreasonable expectation.  <br/><br/>As it turns out even with having the game explained I still missed some critical points on conflicts.  I\u2019m not sure if that was my fault or if the GM didn\u2019t understand and or convey them well.

On page <b>2</b> you find the index where you can read, in big letters "the four oracles: page 28" and this text:<br/><br/>"INVITATION:<br/>what: In a Wicked Age<br/>who: You and three or four of your smartest, boldest, most creative, and hottest friends<br/>where: In your living room, or around your dining room table<br/>when: Once a week or twice a month, for several weeks or a few months<br/><br/>bring: <br/>Mixed dice<br/>The Four Oracles<br/>A deck of cards (with the jokers out)<br/>Copies of the sheets<br/>Pencils<br/>Snacks: tea, wine, nuts, chocolates, fruit<br/><br/>For dice, you\u2019ll need a few of every size (except twenties). Be sure you have sixes with numbers and sixes with pips, both, too.<br/>For sheets, you\u2019ll need a story sheet, a character sheet for each player, a handful of NPC sheets, a few particular strength sheets, and an owe list. The first time, just write \u201cwe owe\u201d at the top of a blank sheet; after that, keep the<br/>same owe list going."<br/><br/>And then, with the game you received a 8-page list called "Oracles"<br/><br/>So, yes, the game is not so well explained like DitV, but it's not so difficult to understand. We played it a couple of weeks ago and we "got" it rather well, with only a couple of little question that got me searching for the forum clarification the following day. All in all, a lot LESS problem we had in trying to use many indie games the first time. (I don't know if you remember my thread from last year about Carry, for example, and I have to write a thread full of question about bliss stage when I will have the time...)<br/><br/>So, I agree with your basic thesis (indie games often could be explained much better), but I don't agree with your example...<br/><br/>About the thread's topic...  I, too, have slowed my buying rate a lot, but it's not a matter of not being exited any more. I have a long list of new games I want to play. But I ordered too many games last year (both new games and games from previous years: having "discovered" indie games in 2006, I had a lot of ground to cover), and I have still not played half of them. And many of these now have a slick new edition with more pages or better art, or rule clarifications, or are cheaper because they were published in pdf too. So now I have a rather strict policy of "buy only the games you will play in a few months, they will not fade away if you wait a little an then when you decide to play them you will buy the upgraded and corrected edition"<br/><br/>A problem I have is that, having to order by mail, I can't browse the books before buying, and it's very difficult to get detailed information by trusted "good players" on new games. The people who write detailed and useful actual play threads are few and far between (but if you can get one of them to write favorably about your game, you are assured to end on my "must buy the next time" list: it's detailed actual play that gets my money, not a lot of "awesome" posts)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128243/#Comment_128243" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T19:59:46+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  7:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even as a ...

Despite serious, serious editing errors (like a discrepancy about Bliss from broken relationships, and a missing rule about starting age), the game text teaches you in exhaustive and slow detail about how to play the game. Thus: zero posting about it.<br/><br/>Fortunately for me, my target audience isn't y'all, so this isn't a big deal. The game plays well (I get private letters from people saying that they're having fun with it) and it's sales are remarkable, considering, which I have to assume is word of mouth in its target audience (anime fans).<br/><br/>But if you're designing not for profit, but for social cred on Story Games?

Start tearing apart texts to the designer's faces instead of just another interview!<br/><br/>Grousing that it's something the community should give you because you don't trust us, well, uh . . . I was excited about IAWA long before it was in its published form. It was pretty damn playable then, and I'd bet it still is in its current form. I will go so far as to say IAWA was, before my Grey Ranks game this Monday, the best game I've ever played. I encouraged a friend to buy it, a friend who had <i>never played a story game</i>, and his session <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25553.0" rel="nofollow">went extremely well</a>. I understand that you're attacking this from a different angle, but I wanted to present at least anecdotal evidence that your view is not universal, or necessarily the direction development needs to head to bring in players.<br/><br/>Then again, maybe I'm having this reaction because I'm terrible at getting games out of texts. Usually I need it demonstrated to me or go through a couple painful sessions before I 'get' it. Doesn't matter if it's a mess like IAWA's playtest notes or a slick super-procedural game like Beast Hunters. I'm coming at it from the point of view of the sort of person that no matter how well a game is written it doesn't matter until it hits the table a couple times with a 'thunk'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128270/#Comment_128270" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T21:13:14+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  9:13PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Book design is all about target audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nIaWA is definitely NOT how I have or am designing a game book.  But that doesn't necessarily make it a bad book.  Its a book very clearly targeted at a very specific target audience (I think I even used it as an example of this in some other recent thread).  The target audience is "people who already know all this and don't want to waste money paying for instructions on how to play...when they already know how to play...or can just ask me on-line".  Its a game targeted very specifically at people who've been following the development of the game for the last year+ several groups of whom have already been playing from piecing together forum post discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's fine.  I doubt the Poison'd final text will differ dramatically from the ash can, and the ash can was similarly targeted.  No one but story-game insiders could reasonably expect to pick up Poison'd and play it even remotely how its meant to be played based on the text alone.  But based on the text PLUS Vincent's online presence...?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if what you're paying for when you buy the book is not JUST the book...but all of the personal attention the designer is more than happy to lavish on you.  What if that means the designer isn't going to hold your hand in the text of the game but is more than willing to hold your hand on an on-line forum to help you get it.  What if this is actually a new publishing paradigm that goes beyond notions of "this is a book" and begins to leverage our current multi-media age.  Vincent's written more text online about play of IaWA (not to mention the even more text written by fans) then would ever have been written in a book...even a thick hand holdy one.  And you get all that too for the bargain price of $12.  Why isn't that considered?  Why does it ALL have to be "in the book".  Why is it assumed that the online stuff is just errata that wouldn't be necessary if the book had been written properly to begin with?  Maybe the online stuff IS the product that you're buying, and the pamphet sized rule book is just the teaser.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that's not how I designed Universalis, and its not how I'm designing Robots &amp; Rapiers or Blood Red Sands.  And frankly, yeah, it drives me a little batty.  I've bitched at Ron for his Sorcerer Text for years until its become something of a running gag because he wrote to a very specific target audience of people who already "got it" and then set up shop on the Forge to lavish all the attention you could ever want to help those who didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter or worse as a model I'll leave to individual opinion, but why isn't that approach just as valid as (my preferred approach) of writing a game that anyone can grok just from reading it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLast Forge Midwest there was alot of criticism like that Josh leveled above...I added my critical voice to it as well.  But actually, since then, I thought 2007 was way better in terms of individual quality control than 2006 or 2005.  Things seem to be better in this regard then it had been...unless there's some rash of shoddy games that just aren't on my radar...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128292/#Comment_128292" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T21:47:34+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  9:47PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

And, this is the kicker...why it seemed that the book was purposefully trying not to communicate with me as a person seeking a game experience from a designer who wanted to help me find it, but just to be a cool <i>thing</i>, pristine and wonderful, but enigmatic and aloof. What good is a book that doesn't try to teach me how to play good? And then Ben gives an answer...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Semi-functional text:<br>1) Pick up text. Read it.

And I still have oodles of confusion about the game mechanics and what makes good conflicts, that the book doesn't seem to want to tell me. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>(I don't know if you remember my thread from last year about Carry, for example,</blockquote>Yes, I had problems with this book as well, and posted a thread of my own, but got a bit tired out trying to find answers.<br><br>As for Judson's ennui, I can't say that I share it. I found tons of stuff on that table to excite me and you can see all the stuff I bought in the Orccon Rocked! thread. But I'm new to the community and story-gaming. I've got tons of stuff left to buy that's been around for years and years, without touching anything new. However, I am seeing new games, some of which get an awful lot of positive buzz and almost no critical analysis, which don't really seem to be completely there. Certainly not like DitV which made me want to start gaming again, or DRYH which made me never want to stop again. If I had come across some of those games first, I don't know if I'd still be gaming today.<br><br/>On a positive note, I played a game at OrcCon with John, Mercutio on S-G, and he appears also to be someone for whom story games have also renewed his sense of excitement in RPGs. I'm a 40 year old man with a wife and 2 kids. He's a grad student. Two very different people which you folks have touched and changed and excited. I think that something to celebrate. And something to keep doing.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128297/#Comment_128297" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T21:56:17+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  9:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 9:57PM by lumpley.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look, criticize my writing, my layout, my approach, my book, sure.

I mean, I'm glad people are bringing it up, if they do perceive a real problem, but isn't it a time for self-reflection and looking for solutions instead of increasing criticism?  I think this thread is really important, but I guess I worry about the tone and the dearth of constructive suggestions for making it better.  I mean, yeah, spending more time on playtesting, development, and writing sounds like a great idea, but how do we encourage people to do that or create an environment where that is the norm without picking on projects that people have put their work and soul into?  I just worry that once the mud starts flying, it'll be impossible to stop it.  This is, after all, the internet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>I Looked at a Table Full

For me to feel like I could get out of the publishing rat race, I had to decide to walk away from commercial publishing entirely, but clearly that's a personal decision and not something that most people are prepared to do.  And even now I still feel the pressure to have a free game ready to give away to people at GenCon.  I mean, WTF?, right.  That's not what indie publishing is about.  It's about doing things on our own terms for our own reasons, not feeling hemmed in by social pressure.  But the expectations of the community, imagined or otherwise, definitely exert a huge pressure on people.  Still, I really doubt that's responsible for all the games people have mentioned so far, since some of them come from folks on the fringes of the community, who don't feel the tidal pull of "publish or perish" as much.  But there is certainly something really powerful there that needs to be subdued.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128320/#Comment_128320" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T22:22:25+00:00" title="February 20, 2008 10:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 10:25PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bonobo Roby</cite>When everybody keeps nodding their head in unison <b>like a cult</b>, you start to wonder if they're all cult members.</blockquote>\nDo what now?

Just that I was wondering if there is some secondary benefit that might have worked against a more comprehensive description of the game, or might have encouraged a rush to printing. On rereading it, my approach reads pretty negatively. I don't think you're being purposefully confusing Vincent, even though that's how my post came off. I do think the text could try harder to put the goods front and center where I can get at them, as you have in other games.

Here's what I mean:<br/><br/>A couple of years ago, when I first discovered the Forge, and realized that these people were talking about what I found dissatisfying in my RPGing, I started buying some of these 'weird indie games'.  And liking them -- but, man, was it ever hard to get my head around some of the concepts:  Unlearning a bunch of the knee-jerk reflexes of trad gaming was difficult, and then learning the new ways of thinking, that make concepts like 'gmless play' or 'story NOW' not complete nonsense phrases.  <br/><br/><i>Sorcerer</i> would have been a good place to start, but I like buying pdfs, so I didn't plunk down for hardcopy indie games at first...<br/>My first Forge-designed game was <i>Capes</i>.  The book explains procedures well enough, but doesn't explain the necessary mindset at all.  Even repeated conversations on the forums didn't really help me at first.  It took a while...<br/><br/>Then came <i>Octane</i> and <i>Against the Reich</i>, which left my mind reeling.  How could <i>that</i> be the whole action-resolution system?  Who controls narration?  Anyone?  I didn't get it.  (I love the breathless, excited style of the <i>AtR</i> text; but it doesn't convey h<i>ow to play</i> all that well, unless you already know how to play indie-style games.<br/><br/>Then I bought <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>.  I wasn't thrilled with the setting, but the resolution system kicked butt, and it was well-explained.  There's a lot of hand-holding there, in first person, as Vincent talks you through this weirdness as if he were sitting there at the table with you.  I had an indie "Aha!" moment.<br/><br/>Next was <i>My Life With Master</i>:  Cool, but I still didn't 'get it'.  The game text explains it's procedures well -- but if you don't have the mental positioning to understand why the rules work the way they do -- i.e. haven't read the Forge regularly for a couple of years -- it doesn't even seem like it would work in practice.  Yet it does...<br/><br/>Then I picked up <i>Universalis</i>, and finally <i>Sorcerer</i> (&amp; all the supplements), having committed to buying actual paper books.  <i>Sorcerer</i>, as a kind of historical text of the indie game movement, explains things pretty well.  Not just <i>how</i> to do something, but <i>why</i> you would want to do it.  Because of the time in which it was written, it was written for a traditional RPG readership, not an indie readership.  That helped a lot.<br/><br/><i>Universalis</i> was written much later, but it too explains the mental things to the uninitiated.  I suppose that it has to, being by far one of the most 'extreme' designs out there.  By this time, I was actually 'getting it'.<br/><br/><br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128386/#Comment_128386" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T05:43:05+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  5:43AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take on the clarity of some other indie games, in no particular order:  <br/><br/><i>Prime Time Adventures</i> -- excellent game, excellent design; completely opaque when read from a trad point of view.  Drop it on a group of people who have only played trad games, and I don't think they would be able to make heads or tails of it.  "You mean we're not all together in the same scenes most of the time?  You mean it's OK for PCs to be in conflict with other PCs?  Huh?"<br/><br/><i>InSpectres</i> has design notes that tell the reader what the author intended to do, and then clearly explains rules that do it.  (If Octane had been written that way, I could have had my first indie "Aha!" moment a lot earlier...)<br/><br/><i>Trollbabe</i> -- Very clear procedural explanations, and it actually goes a little way toward creating an understanding of what indie games try to do.  I can't actually ascribe motives to anyone, but it seems to me that Ron was trying to write <i>Trollbabe</i> as a teaching tool, and it works.<br/><br/><i>Galactic</i> --  Fairly opaque to me, and I suspect <i>very</i> opaque to a trad readership.  Still, it's an ashcan, so it can get better.<br/><br/><i>Bliss Stage</i> --  Reasonably clear explanation of the system (with some holes), but I suspect it would be utterly opaque to trad gamers.  Possibly <i>more</i> accessible to people with no gaming experience whatsoever, and a background of watching lots of anime.  (That may in fact be <i>Bliss Stage</i>'s target audience, rather than indie gamers.)<br/><br/><i>Spirit of the Century</i> -- Very well written and well explained.  Only the Aspect rules are actually that 'indie' in design, so trad gamers could understand and pick it up without <i>too</i> much trouble (although I have read posts from people who just don't 'get it').  I've also read posts from people who complain that the book is too long, and spends too much time explaining things...  ::Sigh::  <i>SotC</i> or <i>FATE 3.0</i> make a great 'first taste' of the indie experience for trad gamers.

Someone with only a set of traditional RPG experiences is going to have a tough time playing the game as it's meant to be played, and using Thematic Batteries to good effect.<br/><br/><i>Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</i> -- Thorough explanation of procedures, but it expects the reader to understand the indie mindset, and does not explain <i>that</i> at all.<br/><br/><i>Sons of Liberty</i> -- Again, a thorough explanation of procedures, and it's a blast to play, but I don't think trad gamers would even recognize playing <i>SoL</i> as 'roleplaying' by their definitions.  (I've introduced it to trad players and got that reaction -- and they've still had fun playing, which is cool.)<br/><br/><i>Shock 1.1</i> -- Mostly clear in terms of it's esoteric procedures, and a truly excellent design.  And. like my assessment of <i>SoL</i> above, although for entirely different reasons, I don't think trad gamers would recognize it as an RPG at all.<br/><br/><i>Dirty Secrets</i> -- Very clear, very concise, especially given it's 'peculiar' mechanics.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  There is some text devoted to explaining the mental positioning for play.  I think <i>Dirty Secrets</i> could be used to teach indie-style play.  Just follow the mechanical procedures as they are given, and the game will work.<br/><br/><i>Polaris</i> -- Beautiful book, beautiful text, fairly clear procedural instructions; but unless you have played indie/Narrativist <i>and</i> GMless before, I suspect you will flounder.<br/><br/><i>Grey Ranks</i> -- Complete and thorough explanation of procedures -- but again, a trad reader would be left thinking '???' and 'Is this a roleplaying game?  Where are my guy's <i>stats</i>?' <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><i>In a Wicked Age</i> -- Although people upthread have had difficulty understanding the text, I found it to be clear and concise with regard to procedures.  It contains absolutely <i>no</i> text devoted to explaining the design intent, or explaining what I've been calling the 'indie mindset'.  (That seems to have been a very conscious decision on Vincent's part.)  But if you follow the steps in the rules, the game works.  In contrast to the <i>Art, Grace, &amp; Guts</i> playtest rules, which were difficult for me to figure out, <i>IaWA</i> is very clear.  (<i>IaWA</i> gave me my most recent indie "Aha!" moment, regarding dynamic <i>vs</i> static situations.)<br/><br/><br/>...Damn, I <i>am</i> a wordy bastard...<br/><br/>Summing up all my examples, then:  I think that the trend in design lately has been to 'preach to the converted'  i.e. write games for people who already play indie-style games, rather than writing games for the (slightly) broader 'general RPG' audience.  This will tend to look like 'designing for other designers', but I don't think that's been any designer's conscious intent.  (There I go, ascribing motives again...)<br/><br/>Here's a wild thought, and probably more controversial than I intend it to be:  <i>Play Unsafe</i> is out there (though I haven't got it yet); what if someone wrote <i>Story Gaming for Dummies</i> or some such?  A primer on how to play these sorts of games, with explanations and examples.  Then we could all point readers to that book, the way <i>D&amp;D</i> books point readers back to the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for basic explanations.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128393/#Comment_128393" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T06:26:38+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  6:26AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 6:27AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I strongly disagree that IAWA or PTA are in any way unclear on how to play.

I don't think this thread should be a class between critics and supporters of IaWA.  It should be a call for much more open and honest criticism.  If a game has problem people should talk about those problem.  Saying a game has problems doesn't mean it doesn't have great points too.  It certainly doesn't mean you can't play and love it either.  I think we have hit on IaWA enough here.  If people want more in depth discussion about its specific problems and strengths they should start a thread for that.  This topic is bigger than IaWA.  We should focus on the topic and not just IaWA.<br/><br/>Now to answer your question,  I don't think the book + online support is acceptable.  For one thing I think it's just justification after the fact and not a conscious design decision.  Many people who buy and play indie games are not active participants here or on other forums.  They hear about games from a podcast or see them on a table at a con.  They buy and play the games and we never hear a word from them.  I know these people exist because I see them every time I go to a con.  These people, along with everyone else, have the the right to expect to be able to play the game from the book alone.  This is especially true if the book says "by Vincent Baker,"* because that alone is enough to make some people buy the book.<br/><br/>* Yes I broke my own rule, I'm sorry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128426/#Comment_128426" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T07:18:51+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  7:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 7:23AM by Andy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><br/>Some people like stuff you don't like.

I tend to not talk in public about the stuff that didn't appeal to me, unless I see a chance to respond to a specific point. Like if someone asks for advice on Game X in general, I'll give my honest opinion. But I won't start a thread or interject my negative criticisms of a game "just because".<br/><br/>Here's a real life example: Back on May 23rd of last year I whispered a friend in this very forum. I told him that <b>Full Light, Full Steam</b> was, "hands down the ugliest laid-out RPG for its size I'd ever seen, and that includes the Game Chef and 24 Hour RPGs I've seen". I described it as "amateurish", having looked like "it was done in MS Word by a high school freshman". I told the person that it "is a tight hardback, and has some great ideas, but the inside just looks like an endless RTF file. It's dull on the eyes, and I could not get through more than a page or two without losing focus and putting it down".<br/><br/>So... what, am I supposed to regularly say this kind of stuff out loud about things that don't appeal to my personal sensibilities? <br/><br/>For others, they'll get right over the layout and find the awesome game inside. I don't feel that I have to come to an opinion on every product I see, and then share it with the world. If someone asks, like specifically "Has anyone seen FLFS? What do you think?" I might whisper that person with my thoughts on the layout in order to see if that would be a factor to them. But I'd rather not just come right out and start a thread saying "Hey Guys, FLFS looks like crap!" I mean, you might be cool with that (I know, frex, folks like Matt Snyder or Luke Crane are always like, "You have criticisms? Bring them on! Make them public! I don't care, I won't get too upset, really!"), but again I'd rather just save that criticism for a time when someone asks specifically about it, and I feel that I have an opportunity to give someone an honest criticism that works for them.<br/><br/>But what it sounds like you're proposing is that we all stop whispering this kind of thing, and post it publicly on our blogs, forums, etc, rather than offering our dissenting opinions whenever and wherever we can in private. I'm not comfortable with punching passersby in public with my own bitter reality. I'd rather move on and just talk about the good stuff rather than yelling out the bad from the mountaintops. If that makes me one of the cult, well... I'm still waiting for my robes.<br/><br/>Some people think being polite is a sign of weakness or intellectual cowardice. I simply don't agree.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128427/#Comment_128427" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T07:19:16+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  7:19AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This post is probably a bad idea, but since when have I ever let that stop me? <br/>\n<br/>\nI seem to have a talent for ambivalence or middle-of-the-road-ness or something. That is, I think that the fact that the games that Judson saw didn't thrill him is... quite normal. That is... we certainly don't expect that every person reading a RPG will be thrilled to death by the prospect of playing it, do we? I mean we only expect that a certain percentage of folks seeing a new game will ever even pick it up and look through it, much less play it. Right? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the problem is that not one game thrilled Judson. While I'm fully willing to believe that this phenomenon might be caused by February, or some sort of indie gaming adolesence or something, I'm also willing to believe that these games just didn't turn Judson on. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, while others seem to like Vincent's writing style for DitV, and claim it's a great game, I don't like the writing style one bit. Nor the premise, either. I appreciate it's design, and actually have fun playing it when folks ask me to do so, truth be told. That's a testiment to Vincent's abilities. But that's not saying that as a product his book is perfect for me. Far from it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat might put me in a minority around here. And maybe Judson is in a minority by not liking any of the games that were on that table. But, you know, we're all individuals, and what one player finds good, another will not. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question it raises is whether or not quality control is suffering. I haven't read IAWA, but is it really a lot worse than DitV? I can't imagine it will be for me. In fact from the description above, I imagine it might be better for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is the perennial question of "target audience." Let's be clear here, all RPGs take this into consideration. Or, rather, what they all don't include are the 300 pages that one could include in every RPG on "What an RPG is, and how to play one well." They all - and I mean all here - assume that either people know how to play RPGs, or that they will just figure it out on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo some extent. Some do have longer descriptions of what RPGs are, and how to play them well, but they all fall short of a comprehensive manual on this. That's because these are not "How to play RPG" books. They are "how to play this RPG" book. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's similar to the target audience of a book on plumbing that is written for plumbers. It's not going to attach 300 pages on the pamphlet for how to repair X water-heater that runs 10 pages, that covers stuff the plumber learned in his apprenticeship. It'll assume he knows it, or will find it out somehow. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, some of these RPGs in question do assume an "indie-ready" audience, I think. I think that's non-problematic. As long as the goal wasn't to sell the game to the "mainstream" gamer. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that, interestingly this does not make these games any less accessible to the complete non-gamer. That is, the complete non-gamer is going to take a lot longer to figure out all of D&amp;D, than they are to figure out how to play DitV. Period. The only "loss" in the assumptions that are made with some indie games in terms of the target market is that traditional gamers won't have quite the ease of entry into playing that they might have with another traditional RPG. Though their entry into indie a given indie RPG is still likelier easier than the non-gamer into either sort of RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this effect is an unavoidable side-effect of the innovations that make these games the innovative "indie" products that they are. So criticizing them for being this way seems to me to be kinda pointless. <br/>\n<br/>\n"You've made this crazy new game, and you haven't explained it in a way that the traditional gamer will recognize!" Well no. Sorry. Not possible. Especially not without a lot of bad text that reads like, "Whereas in D&amp;D you have Hit Points, in DitV you have Fallout..." <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which is not to say that every game is created equal. Perhaps this latest batch that Judson viewed *is* objectively poorer than others. But that, too, is not enough data points to call a trend. Basically you expect that some consumers will be disappointed broadly some of the time. Even while others are beaming brightly about the same products. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I could say to Vincent, "Dude, change your writing style to make it more like the textbook approach that I prefer!" But I don't think that Vincent is capable of that, nor do I think that he'd be well served by doing it... he'd probably be alienating more people than he'd be converting to his games. I have let Vincent know how I feel, just in case I'm wrong, and he can write that way well, and he decides that there are enough data points that it's a good idea to go that way. But I don't expect a change. <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly because what I'm pretty sure of is that Vincent is writing his games the best way he knows how. If you've ever met Vincent, you probably have left the encounter with the same impression I have of a powerful sense of his integrity to his work. Telling him to do better is tantamount to telling the leopard to change his spots. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote, too, that "indie" has always meant a bit of a rough edge to products. Know what? Vincent is not a professional. I think that, somehow, that people equate the brilliance of some of the ideas that come out of the indie movement with a notion that these designers are as talented as real professional designers. I too joke about the "industry," but I'll posit that Malcolm Sheppard is more professional in his productions than most (or maybe all) "indie" designers. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat shouldn't be shocking, right? Doesn't "indie" connote that? The products we make are simply not going to have as much polish as those made by a group trying to act professionally. Oh, sure, Burning Empire wins awards for layout, but, then, Luke IS a layout professional. So no surprise there. Vincent is not a professional writer. Given that, I think he does astoundingly well. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's like somebody has said, "Gee that punk band sounds a little rough." Well... isn't that part of punk? The DIY sensibility of democritization of the artform? That explicitly says that "more crappy stuff that allows for gems to rise is better than a few items selected by the pros?" <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's key to me. This indie movement will neccessarily have a ton of crap in it. A ton. That's part of the process. That means that, at times, you're not going to like anything new on the shelf.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know about others, but I only purchase what I'm going to play. And there have been GenCon's where I've purchased zero games from indie designers. Does that mean that I think that they should not have been written and sold, just because they didn't turn me on? No, quite the opposite. I'm glad that they're turning somebody on. Or, if they aren't... if they sell zero... that's just the mechanism functioning as it should, winnowing out those entries that don't deserve to be played, which gives us a mimimum quality level check to go up against when we're publishing. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we do have some slight standards, even if they're not professional ones. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Yes there are probably some RPGs that have not sold that somehow deserve to have, but that's a whole different point). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo quote on of my favorite quotes from the Who:<br/>\n"This is no social crisis, it's just another tricky day for you."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis probably seems dismissive. Am I just hiding my head in the sand? Well, here's the other most salient fact about this. The only thing I can do as a designer is to do the best job that I can. Right? Do as much playtesting as is practicable. Get the text revised until it's as understandable as I'm capable of making it. Etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK... got that message loud and clear. I'll do what I can. It'll never satisfy everyone, but, then, I only need it to satisfy a very few people to matter to me. So....<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Most people, not surprisingly, don't feel comfortable with dishing criticism unless and until it's specifically solicited. The notable exception, of course, are formal reviews of the type Chris routinely posts to RPGnet. It is a little surprising to me that more of our crowd here doesn't post formal reviews. Though I suspect some of that has to do with the fact that many of us are designers and don't feel comfortable reviewing other designers. Maybe that is something we should try to look at and ultimately overcome?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128438/#Comment_128438" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T07:36:57+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  7:36AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD -- <br/><br/>Whateverthefuck "Trad" means is:  'traditional RPG players'  -- people who have played <i>only</i> <i>D&amp;D</i>, White Wolf games, etc., traditional role-playing games going all the way back to <i>Traveller</i>, <i>Empire of the Petal Throne</i> and <i>Gamma World</i>:  Games where there is a GM, who has ultimate authority, Rule 0 and all.  Games where the player roles are a party of dissimilar characters, each fulfilling a protected niche, operating under maxims like 'don't split the party' and 'interparty conflict is a BAD THING(TM)'.  <br/><br/>(All of which you already sussed, since you identified the type as people you had played PTA with. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )  And I don't doubt that you were able to play successfully with a group like that -- because <i>you</i> were there to teach the rules <i>and the mindset</i>.  <br/><br/>In my overly-long post above, I'm talking strictly about dropping the printed book (or pdf) on a group of people with no previous indie play experience, Forge or Story Games reading, and with no one to help them along.  In other words, people just like the person I was a couple or three years ago.  Color me pessimistic, but in such a sink-or-swim situation, I'm afraid that most of them will sink.  <br/><br/>Granted, if they don't hang out at the Forge, or here, or at least on RPGnet, there is very little chance my example players will ever have heard of any of these games in the first place, so maybe my example situation is a bit extreme.  But there <i>are</i> stores that stock indie titles, and some indie titles can be had through RPGnow, etc., so I think it's at least plausible. <br/><br/>Without access to and recourse to the Internet for Online Support, or a real live person to teach the game and it's story gaming techniques, most of the games I mentioned in my post would not be played as intended by their authors in such a situation.  The ones that I believe are exceptions to that I noted.<br/><br/><br/>Ralph --  (getting back on topic)<br/><br/>Brief Book + Online Support is fine for people who can get to the online support, or want to bother to get to it.  It's what we essentially do now in many cases, and it works fine for us.  But we're all here <i>already</i>.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  If one of the designer's goals for a game is to bring new players into the story gaming style of play, (and it need not be), then the Extensive Book model is IMO more effective -- or the <i>Story Gaming for Dummies</i> primer + Brief Book model that I suggested tongue-in-cheek.<br/><br/>I also agree with John that the fact that the game is built around Online Support should be clearly stated.  When I buy a game, I like it to be 'complete in the box' even when there is no box.  If it requires access to other things, I want that to be explicitly mentioned.<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128443/#Comment_128443" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T07:40:37+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  7:40AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The brief online book + online presence makes me edgy.<br/><br/>Mind you, having an online presence doesn't make me edgy at all but having an incomplete book - something about it just makes my teeth hurt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128450/#Comment_128450" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T07:51:46+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  7:51AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DainXB</cite>(All of which you already sussed, since you identified the type as people you had played PTA with. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )  And I don't doubt that you were able to play successfully with a group like that -- because<i>you</i>were there to teach the rules<i>and the mindset</i>.</blockquote>\nThe <b>hell </b>I taught a mindset!

It just never clicked for me, and seemed to be missing some situation creation stuff. <br/><br/>So we all know I love Dogs. Dogs is the best designed game on the market, IMNHO. <br/><br/>So I liked Full Light, Full Steam. Hell, I helped playtest and proof parts of it. <br/><br/>So, despite being all in line with Josh's political stance, I've no interest in Sons of Liberty. Maybe because I'm becoming Canadian and am, like the Clash, so bored with the USA?<br/><br/>So I love the way Nine Worlds looks and presents, but in play I don't actually like the game. Or just can't make it work. Or something. <br/><br/>So when I look at Contenders, Classroom Death Match, Monsters and Other Childish Things, Thousand Suns, and say... Cold City (looked it up on IPR) I don't feel anything at all.<br/><br/>Why? Because they aren't at a platonic standard for game making? <br/><br/>Nope. <br/><br/>Because they aren't for me. <br/><br/>And that is FUCKING AWESOME. (Or, to please the Brits, "rather nice.") <br/><br/>Like, years and years ago I was all like "you know what I hate about games -- they're all the same, all written for the same, all written by the same." Now days games aren't all the same, they aren't all written by the same -- and that means we won't like them all. We won't be excited by them all. It means we have actual fucking diversity, and that's what I've always been wanting. <br/><br/>So that's one part. <br/><br/>I think the other part is well summed up in Jonathan's jaded teenager comment. Or, maybe less with an edge -- when a lot of us first got into this we were fucking starving to death for good games. Now, we're well fed.

Fuck the people who have played other story games or who are first-time gamers, because what advice is (apparently) useful to them means nothing to me.  I can follow the instructions and figure out how the game works just fine, but somehow the actual play experience ends up ranging between a complete disaster and "okay, I guess, but not as good as what we usually do."<br/><br/>I suspect one of the reasons for this is because over the years, we've been steadily working out what was fun and what wasn't fun about all the games we've played in before.  When we sit down to play a new game, we (obviously) want to have fun, and because we're not complete idiots, we'll attempt to apply what we've learned from our fun experiences of the past so that we can have fun again.<br/><br/>And, as has been discussed in other threads, it's GOOD for people to learn what they like and don't like and to apply those lessons in any way that make their gaming better, so please don't anyone jump directly to some kind of "ah ha, trad gamers are hidebound fools who need to open their minds!" conclusion.  A guy who has played in and enjoyed "traditional" gaming for ten years is obviously doing lots of things right, even if it means that he takes longer to pick up on an indie game than a non-gamer.  For that matter, he's doing lots of things right even if he never figures out how to make an indie game work for him.<br/><br/><br/>I think I really need a manual for a story game that doesn't just tell me how to play it, but one that tells me WHY to play it -- what makes conflict between characters fun in a story game, when I've already learned how much fun I have working <i>with</i> other characters (not to mention painful memories of how intraparty conflicts ruined everyone's fun)?  What makes narrating the results of my own actions fun, when I've learned from traditional games that I like conflicts where at the end I discover something I didn't know before?  Is it even possible to "win" narration and get that same thrill, or do you have to aim for an entirely different kind of fun?  And if it's the latter, then what makes the different fun better than what I was doing before?  That's the kind of stuff I'd want to see in a story games primer, and that's what would get me psyched about trying a new story game.  As it is, I tend to look at the proverbial table full of games and think "Oh, okay, that's sort of like like the story game we tried and didn't click with last year, so let's not waste any more time on it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128517/#Comment_128517" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T09:27:47+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:27AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 9:28AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Why isn't Brief Book + Online Support just as valid a publishing model as Extensive Book?</blockquote>\nAs already stated, it can be.

Not casually want it.  Not "hey some cool people on line say this game is great lets check it out sometime".<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion that's never going to work.  You're going to check it out casually, you're going to bring all of the "things you learned about how to make fun happen" from your other games to the table...where they will be horribly out of place and likely break the game.  You might get an enjoyable evening out of it, but it will pale in comparison to your regular games so you'll shrug say "don't really see what the big deal is about these new fangled games" and move on, decidedly underwhelmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't believe any amount of "Guide for the Traditional Gamer" text can possibly help with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way through that is to REALLY REALLY WANT to grok story gaming.  And for that you have to really work at it.  Its easy for some...but for most folks who are already having fun playing traditionally...its work.  Its hard.  Its unlearning almost everything you know about "how to play an RPG"...including stuff that works REALLY well in your current campaign and that you learned the hard way through years of blood sweat and tears...yeah that...scrap it...it doesn't apply here.  You have to be willing, no not just willing...EAGER...to have sucky play after sucky play after sucky play while you train new gaming "muscles" that you rarely if ever used before...not better muscles, not superior muscles...just different.  Like the way a dedicated runner finds themselves in a whollotta pain when they take up cycling...different muscles.  Different techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no manual that can be written to a Traditional Gamer that's suddenly going to illuminate all the stuff you need to do to make a story game work, to make your play in a story game amazing.  You have to put in the effort to practice.  Just like you put in the effort to learn how to game traditionally.  Story Game books may be short, but that doesn't mean they're easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said "Oh, okay, that's sort of like the story game we tried and didn't click with last year, so let's not waste any more time on it.".  That to me is a very telling statement.  If that's ALL the effort a group is willing to put into it...try it once or twice and if it doesn't "click"  move on...then no.  Its never going to happen for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that can be fine too.  If you're enjoying what you're doing, great.  There is this other great way to play that's out there too, but you're going to have to be willing to sweat and bleed a little to get there.  And if you've already sweated and bled to get where you are with the games you already play...and you're not interested in sweating and bleeding more...then cool, story-games may not be your thing.  But there isn't a magic text that's going to give you a short cut to instant story-game satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany (most) of the Story Game pioneers were willing to sweat and bleed because their Traditional play was not fun...to the point of being ready to give up on the hobby all together.  That made the work to master Story-gaming worth it.  Others are just avante gard explorers willing to put in the work just to see what's over the horizon.  For many of us, the work isn't work...its its own kind of fun (the way dedicated body builders get joy out of a workout while the rest of us think its just damn painful). And for some, it came as naturally as breathing.  But if you aren't one of those who just get it right off the bat.  It will require effort.  Lots and lots of practice. And since practice makes perfect you can expect your practice games to be less than perfect...and be ok with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128535/#Comment_128535" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T09:41:13+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:41AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bonobo Roby</cite>Fred, come on: I'm talking here, at this moment; that doesn't mean I'm not playing -- or designing, or publishing, or playtesting, or coordinating gamer camping trips, and so on.

But I think that's rare. As I say in my previous post, I think that in most cases trad gamers are better situated to learn indie rpgs than non-gamers. <br>\n<br>\nThe less controversial statement is simply that trad gamers have baggage that makes it more difficult to learn indie RPGs than if they didn't have that baggage. That is, it doesn't neccessarily make it more difficult to learn an indie RPG for a trad gamer than it would be for a non-gamer to learn, it's just harder for the trad gamer to learn the indie RPG than it would be if said gamer were an indie-rpg player who had already dealt with that baggage. <br>\n<br>\nBecause most of us were, in fact, trad gamers at one point. In fact by this definition, a "trad" gamer is simply somebody who hasn't been exposed to anything else. And it would be surprising for them to have no difficulty at all in adjusting. No?

I didn't realize I needed someone to say this, but I did.<br><br>I do my best to be unrelentingly positive about things I like and frequently if not completely silent about things I don't.  I consider this to be good form.<br><br>Primetime Adventures leaves me cold (impassioned defenses of its out-of-the-box playability to the contrary, the first <i>several</i> local efforts to play the game were dissatisfactory for me). Later play has produced intellectual enjoyment for me, but rarely emotional, visceral enjoyment.  I've had ample opportunity to talk about this in tons of forums.  But I don't anymore.  I don't, because I don't like taking a steaming crap on the fun other people have.  <br><br>Similarly, I have a sensitivity to the money invested.  When someone's bought art and funded a print run, the last goddamn thing I want to do is bitch at them -- or worse, in public -- and create a sense that that money has been wasted.  I'm not that guy.  I won't be proud of myself or feel good about myself at the end of the day if I do that.<br><br>My mom is an intensely critical person.  So am I, if I let myself be; I'm patterned after her behaviors, there, to be frank.  For both of us, that tendency to be critical of things has been a <i>problem</i> for us in our lives.  Because when you lead with negativity, you are perceived negatively.  We've both had to learn specific behaviors to curb that tendency.  I'm not about to unlearn mine.  If I did, I'd have plenty of negative notes to hand around -- the bits I do let peek out are only the tip of the iceberg.  <br/><br/>But that doesn't invalidate the positive things I have to say at all.  I'm just a spotlight, man -- I see what's interesting on a given stage, and I shine <i>there</i>.  The fact that I find the cover design for <i>Sons of Liberty</i> to tragically undersell the game in terms of shelf appeal stays over in the shadows.  The fact that a good 75% of the games out there that I've taken the time to read don't provide enough examples of play, enough "how to play the game" advice -- something I see other folks here talking about -- stays in the shadows too.  To the extent that I want to see these sorts of problems fixed, I fix them in my own designs and products and hope that people who see those things will take cues from it in doing their future efforts: Spirit of the Century has cover art that sells the gonzo pulp feel of the game, and it drowns in examples of play and advice on how to make the most of the game.  That's all part of the <i>be the change</i> rather than <i>bitch about the need for the change</i> philosophy I've got going on here.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I believe joy should flourish and disappointment should die.  I take personal action in support of that agenda.  My enthusiasm -- the things I like about games that I talk about -- is genuine: I use it to connect my joy with the joy of others so that they may breed and make happy fuzzy babies together.  <br/><br/>My disappointments aren't worth dwelling on; if I do, it only cuts into the time I could spend being joyous about the stuff I do like.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128577/#Comment_128577" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T10:30:07+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 10:30AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 10:30AM by ptevis.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>We can try to help.

Its never going to happen for you.</blockquote>\nWell, to be fair, we played PrimeTime Adventures far more than once or twice.  There was a lot of interest in it, and we put a lot of effort into making it work...it just didn't.  All told, we probably invested about 3-4 months on trying out different story games, and I wouldn't say that any of those sessions were successful.<br/><br/>Hard work isn't an obstacle for our group; the effort everyone puts in to make our usual games successful is enormous, and we all reap the benefits of it.  Hard work that doesn't generate any noticeable improvement over fourteen weeks, and hard work that you're doing <i>instead</i> of doing something fun, on the other hand...well, it gets really hard to justify that.  Anything at all that could've eased the transition for us would have been extremely welcome, and probably would have made the crucial difference between where we are (most of the group not satisfied by story games, and half who are convinced that story games simply aren't for them) and where we wanted to be (able to play and enjoy every game on the shelf).<br/><br/>I get your point about how what works in a traditional game can be counterproductive in a story game, and that perfection might require a ridiculous amount of practice and "unlearning," though, and that since we've got a great group dynamic and have lots of fun with our traditional games, we may not have the same kind of incentive to go through all the stuff that the story game pioneers did.  <br/><br/>I suppose in the end it doesn't really matter, because at this point I think our group has learned more negative lessons about story games than positive ones; we know a lot of things that don't work and aren't fun, but never stumbled across the good stuff.  Odds are we won't ever play one again, unless our regular games stop being fantastic or a really earthshakingly phenomenal game that we cannot possibly ignore hits the shelves.  Still, it's like a loose tooth for me, and I can't help but keep poking it with my tongue by reading these threads and looking over new games.  I want to understand what all the fuss is about, and how to best unlock the fun that's supposed to be in there.  I want a story game that really sells itself to me, that wants to make itself understood to me, that explicitly discusses what I already do and why I shouldn't do it, that suggests things I should do instead and how that will be fun.  I realize that I probably want too much, but there it is.  I wouldn't expect to be good at tennis if I never practiced, but I also wouldn't expect to get good without getting some lessons.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Anyway, I don't really expect a magical solution to this, I'm mostly just venting.  (And I should add that I'm pleased as hell that there seem to be more threads cropping up about gaming skills and "how to play" these days.

(This whole thread is in scare quotes, why does 'get' get its own? Who can say.)  In fact, there's virtually nothing in story gaming that hasn't had some roots in some part of trad gaming that go back years, so the experience makes them have sure footing.  White Wolf gamers have been looking at relationship maps, D&amp;D gamers have been dealing with random situation generator tables, and so on. <i>Maybe</i> narration passing is new-ish enough to cause problems, but it's not a conceptual problem, people understand it well enough and easily enough.<br/><br/>Second of all, why would "getting an enjoyable evening out of it" be a failure of some kind?  So a game doesn't blooowww youurrr miiiiind, maaaaan, so what?  If a game is fun for an evening or nine or a thousand, is that not its function?

The little tiny feeling I had of missing a distant relative inflates to being ditched by my friends.  I'm twelve years old and suddenly alone in a shopping mall, with the growing feeling like somewhere, all my buddies are in the arcade, laughing at me.<br/><br/>I completely understand the urge to be polite, to avoid giving insult.  (And I strongly empathize with Fred and his mom - me and mine are the same way.)  But you're being polite to designers, and leaving players (not necessarily different people) in the cold.  If we only provide our negative opinions in private, the public conversation is, obviously, overwhelmingly positive.  There are so many consequences of that...<br/><br/>For one, Ben's description of a reward cycle that actually encourages broken texts is, I think, well taken.  There's no inhibitor on that cycle except bad press, and almost no one around here does that.  <br/><br/>Players (as a role, rather than a class) spend a lot of time wrestling with texts or designs that aren't a good fit.  Say I really have trouble sticking with a text that's presented in a boring form, for example.  It's really unfortunate then that when I see the conversation about <i>Full Light, Full Steam,</i> nowhere does your opinion of its layout appear.  When I snag it from Josh, then, that's wasted money and wasted time I could instead be playing a game that I'd enjoy better.  Instead of fighting to get through a weak layout, I could be <em>improving my play</em> with <i>Nine Worlds,</i> say.<br/><br/>Knowing Josh, I also know that he'll take criticism of his layout particularly strongly.  I think that's a good thing, especially if it inspires his future layouts to be clearer.  If he can't take that kind of criticism, he shouldn't have printed and sold <i>Full Light, Full Steam.</i> <br/><br/>There's no requirement that voiced misgivings has to become a crowd of rpgPundits, either.  Other forms of art and media develop whole mature schools of criticism (as opposed to mere popular review).  They exist in order to improve the state of the art, not to vent the spleens of stodgy academics.  I made a too-tentative step in that direction with the Owlbear, (to which idea the reaction was, ironically, pretty unrelentingly negative, except in whispers) and I'm resolved to do something concrete with that in the very near term.<br/><br/>So, by not "punching the random passerby," I think you're also not pointing out the open pits in the night to your fellows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128614/#Comment_128614" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:31:23+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:31AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I'm not sure bad press helps break that reward cycle.<br/><br/>I think it requires a dramatic restructuring of the social systems and reward mechanics in place in this community.

It never <em>happens</em>.  I'm looking to change <em>that</em> trend.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>But if you're designing not for profit, but for social cred on Story Games?

You can write a good game and contribute to the community, or you can write a half-assed game, and get recognition in that community.  The question becomes, how do we fix the reward cycle?  And that's another thread, I think, one that I'll start if we don't already have one...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Why isn't Brief Book + Online Support just as valid a publishing model as Extensive Book?</blockquote>\nBecause I'm buying the book, and presumably the book's implied guarantee is that <em>it works</em>.  I'd be totally on board with you if, at the IAWA order page, or in the IAWA text, it said what you've said here.  I think that would be awesome.  I also think it would be a huge commitment on Vincent's part, and I don't know if I'd put that commitment down on paper, either (which is not to say Vincent's a coward or anything -- more like he's reasonable with his time and commitments!).  But retroactively applying that structure to an already-published game is not acceptable.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>Here's a real life example: Back on May 23rd of last year I whispered a friend in this very forum. I told him that<b>Full Light, Full Steam</b>was, "hands down the ugliest laid-out RPG for its size I'd ever seen, and that includes the Game Chef and 24 Hour RPGs I've seen". I described it as "amateurish", having looked like "it was done in MS Word by a high school freshman". I told the person that it "is a tight hardback, and has some great ideas, but the inside just looks like an endless RTF file. It's dull on the eyes, and I could not get through more than a page or two without losing focus and putting it down".<br/><br/>So... what, am I supposed to regularly say this kind of stuff out loud about things that don't appeal to my personal sensibilities?</blockquote>\nAndy, I seriously wish you had!  And I mean that, seriously and honestly and as genuinely as possible.  Because the thing is, I want to participate and engage with this community, and if the community's rules of discourse are Thumper's (If you can't say something nice...), then that makes it ridiculously hard to engage.  What's more, <em>FLFS</em> was my first book, and certainly not my last -- Paul Tevis talked to me about similar concerns with the layout, and a good portion of those comments went into my decisions on how to lay out <em>SoL</em>.  I need feedback, and fuck, I'm a big boy -- I can take criticism!  I think it's a tragedy how little criticism there is in indieland -- how are we supposed to get better if we don't identify problems to be addressed?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>But what it sounds like you're proposing is that we all stop whispering this kind of thing, and post it publicly on our blogs, forums, etc, rather than offering our dissenting opinions whenever and wherever we can in private.

By no means am I proposing that we all start taking shit all the time, or even as you suggest that we shout about the bad and talk about the good.  I'd really just like balanced conversation that recognizes good <em>and</em> bad.  Because if all we ever talk about is the good, we never recognize the bad, and then we never address the bad, and then we never get better.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>My issue is with games that I have to play to figure out that they're not for me<i>when the publisher could have told me that beforehand</i>. That, I'm coming to realize, is my problem with the bare-bones game. There's not enough information between the covers for me to make an informed decision. (Yes, I realize this sounds whiny and petulant.)</blockquote>\nWhat's petulant about this?  "I want this product to inform me enough to make a good decision on whether or not to buy it" is absolutely justified.  The onus is on the seller, not the buyer, to explain why the buyer should buy.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>OTOH, I kinda just started using the skills of the real world with indie games. Like, I have to figure out if books or movies are for me without the publisher always telling me before hand, so I just figure that these days I have to do the same with indie games.</blockquote>\nBrand, I call shenanigans.  You go to Borders (or whatever Borders-equivalent you have up there), and you pick up a book, and you look at the dust jacket, and most of the time it does a <em>damn good job</em> communicating to you what is inside, and whether or not you'll like it.  You watch a trailer for a movie, and you get about the same information.  Absolutely the dust jacket writer and the trailer director are trying to get people to buy, but they're not trying to get <em>you</em> to buy.  They are trying to identify their product to the consumers who want it -- and that's something that indie games do a <em>crap</em> job at, because so far the pitch has been, "You know how trad games suck?

If the pitch I get from an Indie game is "You know how trad games suck, this one doesn't!" I know the game is not for me.*<br/><br/>Books at Indigo (the Borders-equivalent here) often do tell me if I'll like them or not, but not because they're trying to be honest. They tell me because they're trying to sell me, and I've learned to read their pitch to know what the fuck is actually going on and how its going to suit me. If I believed what the dust jacket says (good or bad) I'd read a lot more shit, and have not read some really good stuff. <br/><br/>I don't let Tor tell me which Sci-Fi is awesome and I should read, I filter their asses. I do the same with "trad" RPGs. And now I do the same with Indie RPGs. <br/><br/>Which isn't surprising at all, really, given that indie is the new trad and pink is the new red.<br/><br/><br/>*Which, I think, comes more to my vision of the problem -- not with producers, but consumers. If we really think an Indie game will be for us just because it is Indie and not "Trad" we're being dinks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

But consider it from this angle: the reward system in place rewards, say, 300 man-hours of work with 5 units of recognition, or 500 man-hours of work with 4 units of recognition.  No one is looking at that reward cycle and saying, "Gee, I'll put 300 man-hours of work into my project."  What they're doing is looking at the books that earned 5 units of recognition, and they're basing their own projects of what got the most recognition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128635/#Comment_128635" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:54:38+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 11:55AM by Ry.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is kind of like the thing with hanging out with friends - if my friends told me I was an idiot as often as they laugh at my jokes, we wouldn't be friends for long.<br/><br/>Except for the Forge, all the attempts to get balanced or objective on the internet eventually become places where people don't come back.  <br/><br/>I'm with Fred; being loud about what you like, and leaving the things you don't like alone.

Hell, much of the story-games movement seems to have arisen from the perception of failure in the games that came before.<br/><br/>So for me, I want the warty games out there that don't get it right.  Fuck, I think it'd be <i>drastically unhealthy</i> not to have them.<br/><br/>For me, so often, game design has been about fixing a problem I've seen out in the world.<br/><br/>So, some failures have happened in the indie marketplace at present.  Fine, sure, let's agree with that and move on to a celebration that we have something to react to.  New problems to fix in the stuff we do ourselves.  It's how we got started.  The fixes won't be instant -- they might not even be something that happens in 2008 or 2009.<br/><br/>But to repeat myself, the way I fix this is by being the fix, <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></i></b> by shouting at people to get fixed.

So we should stop the "can't we all just get along" pleas and take our various caravans in different directions?  I suppose that will probably be a natural result of the diaspora at some point, when the awkward indie adolescence ends and everyone goes away to their own private or public indie colleges or gets a job in the real world.<br/><br/>I think one of the issues here is "when and where is the best place for criticism to happen?"  In my mind, if criticism happens after the game has already had several hundred copies printed, that's far too late.  Revisions and addendum and the like are all great, but not as good as having the criticism happen before games get commercially released.  However, when people are not writing or designing their games in public, or when open playtests have only moderate participation, it's really hard for that to happen, yeah?  I can think of a couple of really cool games in playtest right now, Anna's <i>Thou Art But A Warrior</i> and Brennan's <i>How We Came To Live Here</i>, and it seems like they've only got a few folks actively involved in playing and offering criticism before the games get declared "done" and go to layout and commercial release.<br/><br/>Honestly, that's where the tragedy is for me, not that criticism doesn't happen after games released (because then it's almost too late), but that people aren't taking it upon themselves to offer criticism before mistakes or oversights become harder to fix.  For my money, I'd rather be involved in and see more criticism at that stage in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128655/#Comment_128655" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:13:26+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:13PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 12:14PM by Josh Roby.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred, I think there's a difference between having the warty games out there to foster discussion and development and having the warty games <em>in the marketplace</em> to foster disappointment and disenchantment.<br/><br/>I also think there's a difference between a community of vibrant criticism and a community where criticism is frowned upon because it's "mean."

Whats more, not everyone will produce their best results in public. Not everyone will get good feedback from "everyone." Which is one of the reasons, I think, we're seeing the fracture. As we get more games that are designed for <i>Not You</i> we will get more games about which your opinion or playtesting isn't going to be helpful. As we get more games designed for <i>Not You</i> we'll get more games that we just can't agree about. <br/><br/>Like, IAWA has such a place in this thread because, I think, its a big dividing line. I loved it. I've actually played it. I've had actual rocking play with it. I also have something not always great to say about the layout of the CR section, but that's an issue few others have talked about or seem to care about. Others have played it and liked it, but only after a hard time. Others have played and it and not liked it -- sometimes for exactly the reasons I did like it. Not because IAWA wasn't well enough written or developed, but specifically because it was so well written and developed for me that it just will not work for them. <br/><br/>Should IAWA have been written better? Designed better? <br/><br/>I dunno, better for who? Better in what way? Better for which committee of the community defining what quality is for which population? <br/><br/>And no, I don't mean that as snotty. Because the design in public has had a very important function in the history of Indie RPG development -- it has led to a certain amount of community standard. It has lead to a kind of social vetting process by which members of the community let each other know before publication what they will and will not take. It has thus lead to a good standard. <br/><br/>But that's breaking down, broken down. And now we've got games being designed in smaller pools, and possibly for smaller pools, but a lot of folks still want the rule and the standard of the old group. <br/><br/>But just because we had it then and don't have it now doesn't mean its gone forever, or that returning to "everyone design in front of everyone else" is the only, or best, way to fix it. Still designing for review, still designing with others commenting and playtesting and pushing, is still good and still possible. It just happens in different groups, with different standards. And, for some people, missing the old group and not having found a new one, it doesn't happen at all. <br/><br/>Which sucks. Like, especially when it happens across old tight lines. But I think the answer is not to try to rebuild the one community with the one core value, but to ride the wave and distribute it across lots of different communities. Accept that NerdSoCal and Nerd NYC and Toronto Indie are going to have different standards, and build up those community standards where you are (even if that is virtual), rather than looking to be excited and involved in every game from every group that has "indie" attached to its name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128675/#Comment_128675" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:32:12+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:32PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bonobo Roby</cite><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>But if you're designing not for profit, but for social cred on Story Games?

I don't think that indie games are special enough that <i>caveat emptor</i> doesn't apply. I do know that I wouldn't have encountered some games at all -- whether as successes or failures -- if I hadn't <i>bought</i> them.  I view every purchase as a risk-investment.  Sometimes that investment doesn't pay out in success.  I shrug and move on.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bonobo Roby</cite>I also think there's a difference between a community of vibrant criticism and a community where criticism is frowned upon because it's "mean."  I'm all for metacriticism about the utility or implementation of criticism; I'm just putting out there right now, with my total lack of authority as to what actually happens on this board, that equating criticism with shouting from the rooftops and being mean is just going to get an eyeroll from me.</blockquote>\nI realize you must have a need to diminish my point of view such that it can be dismissed with an eyeroll, and honestly, I'm not the guy to stand in the way of that.  You've already damaged my own willingness to listen to what you have to say -- or for that matter, to buy your products -- by airing the negativity you feel you have to air.  <br/><br/>Which I think is worth examining.  It's an <i>emotional</i> response.  The internet is a <i>shitty place</i> for things that have emotional content, at the end of the day.  It does not reward such things except by turning them into negative things.<br/><br/>So go ahead and roll your eyes at the idea that criticism done in a place where bad feelings are casually, easily amplified into big huge heart-hurting feelings is somehow bad.  Diminish it and use scare-quotes around the words so you can make them seem small and insignificant to your world view.  I'll roll my eyes and diminish you right back and we'll all be a great big sad mess and improved by it not at all.<br/><br/>Criticism is best done out of text.  In person.  By voice.  With as many body language cues and social forms as possible in order to make sure that we don't appear as giant throbbing bile-spewing cocks to one another.<br/><br/>There's a reason Mendel said after the Dreamation indie design roundtable that he got more use out of those two hours than he did in the last two <i>years</i> of discussion at the Forge.<br/><br/>Some places are just <i>bad</i> for certain kinds of discussion.  I don't try to have a thoughtful critical discussion about games at a rock concert or at a dive bar.  I also don't try to have that discussion <i>in public, on the fucking internet</i>.<br/><br/>So fucking own up to this point, already: when you criticize someone there's a better than even chance that you're going to <i>make them feel bad</i>.  Why, as a fucking human being, would you not think it's better to have that conversation in a way that minimizes the negative emotional response to it?<br/><br/>At the end of the day, we might as a community be fucking up with the products we publish, but those failures are as nothing compared to the colossal lack of talent the world at large has for talking about things on the internet in a way that heads off negative consequences at the pass.<br/><br/>THAT'S why I focus my discussions <i>on the internet</i> on positive things.  Because when you're already in a stinky bathroom, it's better to spray some deodorant around than fart a few more syllables of criticism into the air.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bonobo Roby</cite><em>Edit, crossposted:</em>Jonathan:<strong>YES.</strong></blockquote>\nWhat's terribly funny to me is that, of course, <i>I agree with much of what Jonathan said too</i>.<br/><br/>There's overlap in our perspectives on a lot of important stuff -- in terms of the end results we think should result.<br/><br/>But man, we <i>so</i> disagree about how to <i>get there from here</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128699/#Comment_128699" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:53:10+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:53PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 12:53PM by Josh Roby.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite><br/>But man, we <i>so</i> disagree about how to <i>get there from here</i>.</blockquote>\nYeah, I was chuckling about the same thing.<br/><br/>I don't think the internet is necessarily a bad place for criticism or discussion.  I do think it trends that way, absolutely.  I do think that a number of websites have built up around them a community of users that turns criticism into hate reliably.  But I don't want to write off the internet as a means for sharing and collaborating and especially criticizing.  Because there's some game designer stuck out in Papau New Guinea or something, or stuck in the middle of Saskatchewan, and getting to GenCon or Dreamation or some other national con three times a year isn't enough feedback.  I think the internet is the tool for fixing that problem.<br/><br/>It's possible to present criticism, in text, that is not hurtful.  It is, I swear it is, it's my freaking job.  It takes practice, and it takes work, and it takes discipline, but it can be done.  That's why I think the <em>Owlbear</em> idea has legs, because it offers a peer-reviewed place to do that with some safeguards in place to prevent if from descending into madness.  I'm not saying that we should just criticize with abandon; I sure as hell am not trying to draw a dividing line between who's in and who's out of the kiddie pool.  I'm saying we should criticize carefully and intentionally and honestly, and with the best interests of our fellow designers at heart.

I'm fine with taking some stuff to the public stage <i>after</i> it's been vetted in a few one on one conversations (my preferred mode of receiving criticism) or within a trusted circle.  This is actually one of the things I really liked about the peer feedback groups in Game Chef: it kept the number of critic-cooks in the kitchen to a managable size.<br/><br/>It's full on open public critiquing that I think is damn near impossible to pull off well on the internet.  Because it takes too much work in such a venue to achieve the benefits that are far easier to attain in the aforementioned smaller ones.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I'm not arguing (or at least, not <i>intending to argue</i> -- I'll own that I might have done so without thinking about it) against the need for critique.  I'm arguing about the <i>venue</i> where it works best.<br/><br/>Something like the Master Mines -- or, I guess, the "Owlbear idea", though I'm not sure what that is -- is doing it right, I think: creating a smaller, focused discussion group around a small number of games, as a method for improving those games for their release.

Unless the game says prominently in its external blurb that you need to tap into an online community to play it, then those folk are buying a game that is incomplete.<br/><br/>And that's not really cool.  Worse, if they do so, they may take the view that "those indie games" are incomplete and unplayable.<br/><br/>That and both my FLGS stock indie games on the shelf, if someone buys one and it needs online support to play and that's not indicated, that's uncool.  The same holds for trad games incidentally, some of which are also unplayable without online support, it's OOP but Megatraveller springs to mind in that regard.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the game is upfront that's the position, I don't see any reason why your suggested approach couldn't work perfectly well.<br/><br/>That aside, I thought PTA actually very clear, someone upthread thought it would be hard to follow for a trad gamer, it really isn't.  I thought Dogs pretty straightforward too.  I think some of you chaps may be exaggerating the difficulty.<br/><br/>In fact, the classic indie games, the really well known ones, tend to be pretty clearly written in my experience.  I think some of this is over self-flagellatory.  The only one I ever totally fell over on was Burning Wheel where I read the first 77 pages as instructed and it said to then run it to get those bits under my belt, but it hadn't included either combat or bloody versus tests in those pages so I couldn't.  That I thought a failure of the text, though not a particularly serious one.<br/><br/>I do think though there is a tendency sometimes to blame purchasers for failures of design.  Someone buys a game, can't make it work and gets told they didn't try hard enough?  Fuck that, maybe it should have been written clearer.<br/><br/>But plenty of indie games are perfectly clear, some of this thread IMO is people almost liking the idea of impenetrability because it makes them cooler.  Most big name recognition indie games in my experience are comparable in clarity to major trad games, hell, if we use Mongoose Runequest as a metric many indie games become a model of clarity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5729/i-looked-at-a-table-full-of-games/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5729/i-looked-at-a-table-full-of-games">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5729/i-looked-at-a-table-full-of-games/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5729/i-looked-at-a-table-full-of-games/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5729%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5729%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
