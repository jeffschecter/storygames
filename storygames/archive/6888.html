I find it interesting all the same. :-)<br/><br/>To be exact, the Big Model don't define a meaning for "immersion", because it mean very different things for everybody (the flamewars on rpg.net between people who argue that what THEY do is "immerasive" and what other people do isn't...  is the stuff of nightmares...)<br/><br/>To be exact, this is the definition of Immersion in the <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">Forge Provisional Glossary</a>:<br/><br/><b>Immersion</b>: <i>This term has no single definition. Some uses, among others, include: (a) undivided attention to the Shared Imagined Space, (b) the absence of overtly stating features of Social Contract and Creative Agenda, (c) strong identification with one?s imaginary character. See <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=4640.0" rel="nofollow">Why immersion is a tar baby</a>' and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=10685.0" rel="nofollow">'Immersive Story</a> by John Kim.</i><br/><br/>(I added the links to the thread cited, absent in the Glossary)<br/><br/>"what some people call immersion" (whatever that is, meaning very different things for different people) can have two "places" in the big model:  <br/><br/>1) as techniques, usable for every single creative agenda (and I can assure you, I never noticed any difference in immersion playing with different creative agenda. And the people I know who most go on and on about "their superior immersion" are as gamist as they come, playing always, always dressed as barbarians in LARPS based on defeating another squad - but they insist that they aren't gamist because they are so much "immersive". So, really, your first post in this thread made no sense to me, apart in the usual "my fun is better that your fun" way...)<br/><br/>2) as a technical agenda (in the Lehman version of the diagram, not visible in the usual diagram I put below this message), as is, a preference for some techniques (some people mistake this for a creative agenda, but it isn't)<br/><br/>So, really in the diagram they are "below" the CA (not that it matter so much, you could always draw the diagram upside-down...)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://aycu37.webshots.com/image/28396/2006346976466061518_rs.jpg"/><br/><br/>As an advice: if you want to deepen this discussion about immersion and the big model, the best way to do so would be posting an actual play or one of your games (chosen because it shows what you want to say, or because you think is problematic in Big Model terms) in the "actual play" subforum at The Forge, and ask about it.  There you will find many more people more knowledgeable about the Big Model, and discussing theory in the story-game forum tend to "disturb the zen".<br/><br/>If instead you only want to talk about your interpretation of "Immersion" without discussing the theoretical works about it contained in the Big Model, you should refrain from using Big Model technical terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153350/#Comment_153350" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T10:03:18+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 10:03AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>If instead you only want to talk about your interpretation of "Immersion" without discussing the theoretical works about it contained in the Big Model, you should refrain from using Big Model technical terms.</blockquote>\nI think it's funny how normal English words have been taken over by The Big Model cultists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153375/#Comment_153375" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T11:29:41+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 11:29AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2008 11:31AM by Jogesh EZ.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>Jane McGonigal talks about "immersing yourself in an interactive system".

Immersion doesn't equal narrative play (in fact, by what I call the RPGnet definition that seems to dominate, it's closest to simulationist play, but is actually more like method acting than anything at all game related). In fact, looking at McConigal's wikipedia resume, I doubt she's heard of any facet of the big model or anything of the infant RPG theory. But I could be wrong there.<br/><br/>When you get away from the limited definition that appears to dominate RPG discussion (and the complete lack of definition from the Big Model), and looking to general gameplay, immersion means forgetting about facets or the world. Psychologist Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyi called it the "Flow" - which is used else where as being "in the zone."  Immersion can happen in video games, chess, soccer, baseball, pictionary, etc.  However, that's the ideal state.  It rarely fully engages. Instead most games rely on offers and rewards to draw the player in. And really that's all you can design for. If players are compelled to play to get that next experience point, collect that next coin, or claim that next shot at narrative rights then it's successful. Immersion is like that optimal state, an Oscar award or Nobel Prize, you can strive for it in design, and the better the design fits together the more likely it can happen, but even if players consistently fail to reach it, it isn't a sign of a failed game.<br/><br/>So, your post was way off base, but your title was spot on.  Immersion is what all players strive for.  Roleplayers, soccer players, chess players, solitaire players, Super Mario Bros players, etc....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153378/#Comment_153378" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T11:42:00+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 11:42AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Without diving too deeply into any theory discussion, I have to say that I share Alvin's viewpoint about the alignment of the typical definition of immersion with Simulationist play more closely than Narrativist. <br/><br/>The more general definition of immersion discussed in his second paragraph is what I've always thought about when I say the word. If other people are getting other meanings out of the word, that would explain some of the consternation I've had trying to discuss it in the past. It boggles me that people wouldn't want a high level of immersion in their gaming. My most memorable roleplaying experiences have been when near fully immersed, when everything outside of the game ceased, for a short period of time, to exist for me. Food, sleep, finances, relationship and work problems all briefly gone, replaced by the fictional world created between myself and my fellow players. Even the rules of the game, though still present, didn't get in the way. In some cases, the rules actually added to the immersive factor, though this is admittedly more rare.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153381/#Comment_153381" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T11:43:55+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 11:43AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>If instead you only want to talk about your interpretation of "Immersion" without discussing the theoretical works about it contained in the Big Model, you should refrain from using Big Model technical terms.</blockquote>\nI think it's funny how normal English words have been taken over by The Big Model cultists.<br/><br/>It's even funnier when some people are so invested in showing off to everybody that "they are not cultist" that they act exactly as one.<br/><br/>Kynn, why don't you write your own beautiful thread about your personal views on the use of language in the theory articles, instead of threadcrapping other threads where nobody had that problem until you arrived?

That doesn't mean that you're lost in the setting or the imaginary space, merely that you're so focused on playing the game that you don't think about your job, or whether you left the iron on.  That can mean engagement with the rules, engagement with the social aspects of the game, or engagement with the fiction and your character.  At that level, I think it's reasonable to assert that all players desire immersion of one sort or another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153400/#Comment_153400" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T12:34:26+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 12:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2008 12:35PM by Moreno R..">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that everybody look at what he/she is invested in the game, and the way he/she address it with passion, and call that "immersion".<br/><br/>So, everybody try to immerse in the game.

If they don't, it's probably because they don't enjoy the game (imagine a baseball player who loved the game in college and as a rookie, but only continues to play because of his multi-million dollar contract or, riffing on your example, someone who plays the <a href="http://www.redistrictinggame.org/" rel="nofollow">ReDistricting Game</a> solely to learn about the process of gerrymandering, and not the reward the game offers). To put another way, they are "playing" for another reason than <i>play</i>.<br/><br/>But, ulterior motives aside, tork interpreted me right.  Now, being in the zone doesn't mean you are ignorant of the outside world, or cannot learn from it. I played the ReDistricting Game because it was fun.  And now, months later, I still carry with me the lessons in how corrupt gerrymandering can be. Now, I'm not sure if I got immersed in the game. If I did, it was only for short moments. So, it could be that immersion is either overused or the importance is overplayed. I lean towards overused, judging that most RP gamers seem to use it to describe a level of character connection, but it's definitely a mix of both. I'm not blameless, despite more recently consciously trying to divorce my usage from the method acting definition, I still overuse and over play the importance of immersion.  <br/><br/>I only recently discovered "the flow" as a psychological term. And using that as a basis, I'm not sure if I've ever been really immersed in an RPG.  Other games? Absolutely. I've got a good number of days spend playing Civilization or Alpha Centauri where I start at like 10am, and next thing I know it's midnight and I haven't eaten a single thing.  That might be a dangerous (certainly unhealthy) level of immersion.  And yet, despite that, table top RPGs are still my favorite type of game.  There's a lot more to strive for than immersion.<br/><br/>I got a bit sidetracked there.  Back to your point, I don't think immersion, even at that level, breaks any chance of learning, even real world politics.  I think the way kids play is a lot more immersed, at least more easily, than us jaded adults. It might be why we look so fondly back on those days of games and wish to recapture the "innocence".  And yet, play, child or adult play, is a central human method of learning about the world.  So, a well designed game, be it a sport or political commentary, should be able to make its intended impact regardless of whether or not individual players achieve immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153427/#Comment_153427" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T16:37:25+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  4:37PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going from your meaning, not the "Immersion in character", just to note.<br/><br/>And while I certainly agree that while being immersed in the game one can certainly learn, I think that when we are trying to pass a certain... lesson, and are eager to see whether it is passed successfully, especially once we're more likely to do so (when we are jaded adults, heh), I think it comes at the expense of immersion, and yet is a goal.<br/><br/>Hm, I agree. They are playing for a reason other than play. That's put quite nicely.<br/>My point was simple, that some people do play for those other reasons.

So it is possible the interactive system of a game replace this bigger system, and gives us the chance to interact in new ways. Kind of: now we play outside the interaction of our life, immersing ourselves in an altogether <span style="text-decoration: underline;">different</span> interactive system. So we are escaping our life and world, to play with the idea of something completely different.<br/><br/>The agreement between the players to do this, enforce the system on each one of us. We buy into it and play with full immersion. And if we don't buy into it; we will not play at all or we be disruptive to the games we "participate" in.<br/><br/>...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
