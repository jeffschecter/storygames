<p>So, in the old school, long-form games have continuity. You kill things, take their stuff, and then in the next episode, you <em>still have their stuff.</em></p>
<p>What's this do for us?</p>

                            It allows the stuff to be part of the reward system. If the players have choices to make over the stuff (sell it, perhaps for a discount, to buy other stuff, or when to use stuff with charges, etc.) then it adds to the strategic and/or tactical options.<br/>

                            In general, Continuity allows a sense of accomplishment, of creating something that matters, even if just to you and yours. <br/>
Learning lessons is all good, but building things that you can *see* (well, draw) is just somehow elevated higher.                        </div>

Also, it's interesting that the bulk of continuity is recorded on the character sheet, which is a listing of player resources.  Wouldn't in be interesting if there was a GM's sheet that listed GM resources which was impacted by the resolution of a game's situation?  I think of all those episodes where the bad guys trick the good guys into doing something for them.  Oh no!  Now the GM has more stats available to her!                        </div>

I'm actually doing that with my current BSG playtest. The GM has a book of dots- which are issues created and how they were resolved during each session. This gives them a record of things to pull from for future sessions, and lets them see the state of things at the start of each.<br/>

I'm loving it.                        </div>

                            Well, you could obviously divorce the player from the character and have the player get access to cool stuff and powers and the like without it being related to what his character(s) did in the last session.  Or you could have the group unlock more cool shit for doing cool shit, and the players wouldn't even have to be the same as the last time.                        </div>

                            For the purpose I described--accretion of meaning, as opposed to rewarding the player with resources--I have two suggestions. One is Initiation as in Dogs, also (apparently) Lifepaths, or any other sort of "pregame". But all that's really a sort of telescoped Continuity, a way for the characters to hit the ground running.<br/>
<br/>
The other way is through flashbacks and on-the-fly assignment of resources. Example: relationship dice in Dogs. You have a pool of resources that may or may not do anything for you in its raw form, but during play you can take resources out of the pool and "fix" them into a specific form.                        </div>

                            Reverse the "get stuff --&gt; have stuff" order:<br/>
<br/>
Players have resources - whether they started the game with them, drew them randomly from a deck or just given them during play for reasons unknown (but not because they just "earned" them, because that would just get us where we started). Let's say for this example that these resources (sword, bank accout, magicla doohicky) are written on cards.<br/>
<br/>
Every time a player gets a card (alternative: wants to bring a card into play from his "hand") he has to integrate it into his character's history. He has, right there, to tell us what is this thing, how he got it and what it means to him.<br/>
<br/>
This needs a lot of refining, but I imagine it would create a game full of flashbacks and nonlinear storytelling.                        </div>

<p>It's clear that there are media where this doesn't occur (see: some sitcoms, cartoons of a particular stripe, Calvin &amp; Hobbes), and we still feel contextualised about the characters and they have weight and identity. How'd that happen?</p>

In other words, this is done strictly on the meta level - the characters haven't changed, but because the reader has been exposed to these occurances he views them as part of the characters' mythos.                        </div>

There's three "phases" to the Aeon Flux story.  First, there was the fifteen minute pilot, that they broke up into minute-and-a-half chunks and played here and there on Liquid TV, at the end of which Aeon Flux died, having stepped on a nail.<br/>
<br/>
Then there were the four-minute mini-eps where Aeon Flux died every time.<br/>
<br/>
In one of those, the story keeps running back and forth.  Someone kills Aeon Flux and becomes the hero.  Then someone kills HIM, and becomes the Hero, and back and forth and back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
I watched it last night and said to myself, "Damn.  Shreyas would LOVE this."                        </div>

                            Hey, :)<br/>
<br/>
Shreyas, sorry, my misread and non-obviousness.<br/>
<br/>
(I thought you were talking about the continuity of the items, not the events. Thus I pointed at Heroquest as a game where maintaining that continuity is totally in the hands of the players, in that, after the adventure, they have to pay to keep the items in their character sheet.)<br/>
<br/>
You're talking about continuity of events and what that does for us as role-players. Correct me if I'm wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If I may, your examples of sitcoms and cartoons carry continuity as well, but of a different sort, namely continuity of attitudes and emotions. Even if an event in a sitcom episode isn't propagated to the next episodes, you as a viewer are still left with an internal understanding of the types of attitudes and emotions those particular characters portraied in that event.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... it occurs to me that this is exactly what Nir said.<br/>
<br/>
If you're asking how we could go about aiming for this sort of continuity in our role-playing, I'm thinking, wow, tall, order, but yeah, it might be feasible.<br/>
<br/>
It would have to be at least a semi-long-running "campaign", yet with a highly contained episodic feel to it. I'm thinking PTA with a more off-beat tone might accomplish it, or at least be a push in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
If you're asking something else entirely, then I misread you again...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                            Er, some of us <i>don't</i> feel that characters have more than one episode's worth of weight and identity when there's no continuity. Not that continuity is the ony thing I seek in my entertainment - there's plenty of cartoons and sitcomes I love just fine - but I simply wouldn't be interested in trying to treat the character as anything but a toon without continuity.<br/><br/>Which reminds me: I wanna see someone tackle the subject of cartoons. Much as I love Toon, I bet there are more good things to say about the subject.                        </div>

<i>How'd that happen?</i><br/><br/>It happened because the characters are (1) inherently interesting and (2) repetition and variation strengthens themes.<br/><br/>But without some sort of explanation, you're not going to get away with it in this day and age. Sitcoms have turned increasingly into soap operas. If it were done today, Kirk's <i>Star Trek</i> could never get away with the Federation stealing the cloaking device and then never using it. Continuity is ingrained even more strongly in RPGs for a variety of reasons. So a clear, bold break--as with Aeon Fluxx--is probably advisable to get the audience in the right mood.                        </div>

                            Even in things like Calvin and Hobbes there is continuity -- its just that it is an internal continuity of character rather than continuity of event. Calvin is always Calvin, and his actions, choices, and emotional responses will constantly reinforce that fact. That he reacts this time to playing Calvinball the way he reacted last time to Hobbes messing up his Adventure of Spaceman Spiff is the continuity. <br/><br/>Let's ditto the Conan stories. When Howard wrote them there wasn't a lot of continnuity between the Conan stories. They occured in a pretty random order, didn't usually refere to each other, and even changed facts and locations about the world between stories. And yet, if you read the Howard canon of Conan you get a very strong sense of continuity both in character and in world. It's because Conan makes the same choices, reinforces the same themes, and lives in a world that has the same tone over and over. His continuity isn't "last time on Conan," it is "Barbarism will always triumph." <br/><br/>In that I think some of the ideas in games like Trollbabe could be useful. What you're testing for isn't to see if you can get stuff, its to see if you can establish character through choices. I tend to play Trollbabe a lot like Dogs without the mechanical change to the character -- each episode is a testing of "you said that last episode, do you still mean it if THIS?" Even when the episodes aren't in any kind of chronological order and don't have any reference in the game to what happened last episode, the reference is still there in our minds, and the sense of character revelation (as opposed to character development, which doesn't work as well in this type of game, IME) grows game to game. It works even without Dog's traits from fallout. <br/><br/>Sorcerer and Sword has some more words on this idea, especially in the context of Conan. <br/><br/>I wonder how surreal you could get with Dogs. The fallout system implies some continuity -- but it occurs to me that you could get some wicked Dark Tower surrealist action if between games you said that unspecifiable time and layers of reality passed between towns and let players freely reasign their traits and relations based on themes they want to hit. So in one town you have young brother Hiram who has a weakness for girls and old brother Zeke who can kill anything that walks or flies or crawls, and in the next town you have young brother Zeke the pacifist and old brother Hiram the chaste....                        </div>

<p>Bruce, uh, I'm not sure that I understand why you posted in this thread simply to express your disinterest in the topic.</p>
<p>Brand, yes. <em>Yes.</em> <strong>Yes.</strong> Character continuity is exactly what I was trying to get at, without having the words. Thanks.</p>

                            Shreyas, I saw myself as answering the original question (continuity makes possible for me an extra level of engagement) and then also addressing what I felt like was an insufficiently examined assumption (colloquially, "what you mean 'we', paleface?") about what "we" get out of non-continuity stuff. Or rather who "we" getting that stuff are.                        </div>
