                    I've been inspired to do a rewrite of the Amber RPG, but I'm not here to talk about it.<br/><br/>For those of you who remember this game, what are its best features?  What did you like about it?<br/><br/>Any discussion of flaws is offtopic... I think there's already been a great deal of discussion on that topic.                </div>

<p>The powerful way that Shadow-Walking gets translated into in-game director stance:  Your princes are <em>supposed to</em> happen upon the exact resources and situations that are most beneficial for their story at the moment.  If they want the game to be about war they're <em>supposed to</em> simply imagine a vast army of their own into existence and step up to lead it.  That's their power.</p>

                            I played way too much of ADRPG.<br/><br/>I dug how it fearlessly went into the realm of competitive roleplaying -- hell, it embedded that right from the getgo, what with the whole "bidding war" aspect to character creation.  Pretty hot, there.<br/><br/>It also did a kickass job (at the time) of describing <i>how</i> to game dicelessly.  All flaws aside, this was probably the strongest lesson I took from the game.                        </div>

                            Best parts for me:<br/><br/>1. Information hiding, in big ways. Not seeing your character sheet. (The advancement list is nice too.) Being able to fake your real strength. Never knowing whether you have an alliance unless you've paid points for it.<br/><br/>2. Four impossible things before breakfast. Need an army? Go get one. They think you're a god, by the way. Need an entire alternate reality? Single character point. Shadow-dweller pissing you off? Killed, turned into an ally, or wiped from existence at your whim.<br/><br/>3. The only thing that can challenge you is your relatives. You can wander off into shadow for a thousand years, studying from the greatest swordfighters in a hundred shadows... and it could all fall apart the second you face someone real.<br/><br/>4. To my knowledge, the first game that officially rewarded player contributions. (Note: I typically house-ruled it to five points up front, one point per game that you continue your contribution.)<br/><br/>5. The ability to play on the expectations of those who have played or read Amber before. Is Bleys going to be a good guy this time, or is he going to shank me over the pattern again?<br/><br/>I ran seven interconnected campaigns over the course of four years. I was a big fan.                        </div>

I'm not usually in the habit of quoting myself, but...<br/><br/>I think I really want a focal lens put on relationships in any redo of an Amber game.  Like, if relationships had their own "character" sheets that talked about degrees of loyalty, respect, enmity, approval, etc ... that'd be pretty hot.  You absolutely have to get that whole infighting familial politicking baked right in.                        </div>

                            I think the turn off comes from the fact that a lot of the DRPG encourages these relationships to _suck_.  It takes the suspicions and distrust in the books an dmagnifies them while virtually discarding the examples of trust and close relationships.  I don't think people object to infighting os much as "Every member of your family is out to SCREW YOU and SCREW YOU HARD at EVERY OPPORTUNITY".<br/><br/>I can think of few things more powerful than those moments in Amber games where the GM decided to toss that out the window and had people behave like  family.  Sure, it was a dysfunctional, problematic family, but it was family all the same.<br/><br/>Anyway, getting dangerously close to pure bitching here, so I'll swing back to the positive long enough to say: Relationships == ++good!.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Are you certain that relationships can't be a "fruitful void" in the game?  After all, human relationships are complex and chaotic, and trying to reduce them to a small, finite number of attributes may be confining.<br/><br/>That being said, relationships in Dogs are reduced to two stats (number of dice and size of dice) and there's plenty of room for complexity there.<br/><br/>Hm, this will bear further thought.                        </div>

                            Vax, I have ZERO experience with ADRP and I've read only the first Amber book.  But.  The nature of relationships will almost always be a fruitful void issue, because you can't really nail that stuff down effectively anyway.  You can try, but I suspect that players will always be figuring ways to tweak and squish any such rules to make them sing whatever the players want.  Note that Dogs relationship stats only specify the <em>power</em> of a relationship.  The procedures of play which state that the power only comes into play when the stakes involve the relationship or your opponent is the relationship is what really shapes how the relationships appear in play.                        </div>

                            Well, for Amber, the part of me that wants the web to be a little more complex says that an NPC really is what they want and what they have (and perhaps what they _appear_ to want and have), and where those things intersect with players makes for rich, delicious play.<br/><br/>Amber is a bit weird in that sense, and varies from a lot of indie games in that it has strongly proactive NPCs, which is a bad thing in the forgotten realms, but for Amber, where players are _inside_ the circle rather than outside looking in, it's an essential part of flavor.  To contrast, Dogs NPCs don't need to be important beyond their relationship to the Dogs.  Amber NPCs need to be (or at least seem) more dynamic.<br/><br/>This leaves me wondering if rather than looking at relationships, something akin to TSOY's Keys, albeit for NPCs, might be in order.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - And to answer Joshua, <b>CRITICAL</b>.  In the absence of the NPCs, Amber isn't much of a setting at all, literally.  There are only a handful of things in the books of any import that are not people, and most of those are tied to somebody.  A lot of the reason it's still around is on the strength of it's characters and the fact the one of Zelazny's greatest strengths as an author is expressing a very full character in a very short time.<br/><br/>Now, you will absolutely find that some folks disagree, and many Amber games have successfully disposed of the canon's NPCs, but you'll also find that most such games have done so in such a way to take advantage of the resonance chamber their absence creates.  <br/><br/>It's also worth noting, the core book provides three different version of each named NPC, and almost every game I've ever played has customized them further.  Zelazny created some wonderfully _essential_ character, to such an extent that drastic changes in power, motives and interests can be made without rendering the character unrecognizable.  The upshot of this (combined with a mechanical system almost entirely lacking in dependancies) is that Amber is probably the most customized-yet-still-recognizable game in existence.  This fact has a lot to do with why some awesome games (like Matt Snyder's <i>9 Worlds</i>) which seem almost perfect for this (enthusiastic, passionate) demographic have not moved th eneedle at all.<br/><br/>In short: Amber is very, very, very weird.                        </div>

                            Sometimes they are, and that can rock too.<br/><br/>Power is part of the equation, but that's highly idiosyncratic.  Exactly how scary the elders are compared to the PCs is one of those matters of GM taste and customization.  For my money, the thing that's key is that these NPCs are the <b>peers</b> of the PCs.  The relationship may not be equal, but it's rather like how the FR woudl change if Elminster was your dad.  Sure, he's great and powerful and shit, but you had to clean up after he got drunk and stagged home covered in dragon vomit, and he turned you first date into a pumpkin because she gave him sass.  The power is part of the dynamic, but the relationship is not based purely off the discrepancies in power.<br/><br/>Additionally, when I say the charaqcters are the setting, I'm not exaggerating.  In the absence of those characters, there is very little left that is recognizably Amber.  How much of a problem that is depends on how much Amber is what you want to play, but that can spin into a vicious circle pretty quickly. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Lastly, because Amber's primary dynamic is generational - specifically generational within a family.  PCs (usually) represent the new generation which comes with both limitations and promise.  This is not absolute - sometimes a GM abuses this for bad, but sometimes a GM turns this on its ear and has a game centered around Elders dealign with the annoying behaviors of those damn kids.<br/><br/>When I say Amber is weird, I mean that the answers to many questions *specific to Amber* will be different than they will for any other game sharing the same sort of premise, like Everway.  Some of this is specific to the canon.  Some of this is the very nature of a game about families.  Some of it is because it's in it's own wonderland of mechanics.<br/><br/>But one way or another, weird. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

And that's a good point, and one of the areas that seperates the really interesting Amber games from those I'd rather avoid.<br/><br/>If, along with "YOUR FAMILY IS OUT TO SCREW YOU" the game also says "YOUR FAMILY IS ALL COOLER THAN YOU" then yeah, super lame.<br/><br/>But if instead it means that where you come from and who your family is is _important_ then it gets into 9 kinds of awesome.<br/><br/>And that's a minefield, I totally understand.

                            Though to bring it all back to mechanical strength, this points to something that the Amber crowd views as a strength, but the Indie crowd may not.<br/><br/>One character in the series, Benedict, is a badass.  He's thousands of years old, all spent as a soldier, general and duellist, honing his trade.  He's older than any of his brothers by millenia, and trained them all in the sword.  His other borthers think he's scary enough that he could probably have unseated their father if he wanted to.  He is the elder sibling who will always be better than you, and mechanically speaking, he represents the apex of Warfare, the stat which covers most sorts of conflict.<br/><br/>Given that, bear in mind that the first time we see him in the books, he's lost his hand because he'd hesitated to strike down the woman he was fighting because they'd previously been intimate.  A little bit later, we see Corwin (the protagonist) defeat him by taking advantage of his rage and tricking him into bad terrain.  So in the context of his invincibility, we definately see some flex.<br/><br/>Now, within the guidlines in the core Amber DRPG, Benedict is described as being able to do some, well, stupid things.  Parry invisible attacker.  Guess the range of the firearm you have concealed under your coat.  Kill you with a toothpick.  Throw a knife into heaven.  In short, he's a mostly invincible ninja killing machine.  The problem here is less in the mechanical description of what Benedict's warfare means (mechanically, it means "He's in UR Base.  He's Killing UR Mans") than in the implict GM advice that goes with it: "Nothing your characters ever ever ever do can beat him, or any other elder."<br/><br/>A lot of games turn down that particular dial.  Benedict's history is still all the same, but he doesn't dodge bullets, kill with a stare or run arround parrying unseen assassins.  He's badass, sure, probably Amber's greatest general and swordsman, but he doesn't maintain that distinction casually.  A PC could challenge or possibly maybe even surpass him given time and a compelling enough story.  Maybe not.  Here's a bit of heresy that comes out of Amber play: You always get to be awesome, you don't always get what you want. <br/><br/>Anyway,  here's the fantastic thing.  Drop a player from either of those two games in the other one, and Benedict is still recognizable.<br/><br/>I cannot overstate how huge that is, and it's a big reason why Amber has conventions far in excess of its size as a game.<br/><br/>So yeah, there's a lot of crap in it, but there's magic to it too.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

<p>How's this work, exactly? Given that this is a specific character with a <em>name</em> and a <em>face,</em> is this recognition predicated at all on his behavior or capabilities?

I'm of two minds on that, though I like to look to the books for inspiration.  Merlin's chronicles are full of second generation characters who are not _quite_ peers od the elders, but that's not because there's this VAST power gap between them, it's just because the kids are younger and in some ways less experienced.  It tends to mean the kids are competetive in their areas of interest, and outclassed outside of them, but never to a point of embarassment.  When I was fifteen, my 20 year old cousin coudl kick my ass.  It was unfair I suppose, but in a way I'm ok with finding its way into games.<br/><br/>It's a tricky piece to handle though.  Amber is the game that taught me that the most valuable currency you can give players in any game with a strong setting is <b>respect</b>.<br/><br/>That said, it's hard to break down too much further without exploding in the litany of why the ADRPG shoudl be lit on <b>fire</b>, which I can strongly get behind, but I'm trying to actively avoid that.  There's a lot to hate, so bear in mind that even the most gushing of praise here is a result of accentuating the positive. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D&gt;                        </div>

I'm not overstating when I say it's magic. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Blame Roger Z. if you must.  If you read his stuff, his style is fantastically sparse.  90% of what goes into most Amber games comes purely from just the first book of the Amber series, and it's a <b>tiny</b> little book.  Most characters get three lines or so of coverage, but it's enough to paint a vivid picture, partly through the use of language and partly by pulling in certain iconic tropes.  Many of the Amber characters have simple, mythic cores: the eternal soldier, the good hearted strong guy, the blone socialite, the troublemaking younger brother and so on.  Not every character fits this mold, and those that do have things that sperate them from it, but one way or another, there's a very clear core to come back to.<br/><br/>To be frank, some of it's the art too.  Each character has an iconic portrait by Mike Kucharski, and that's about all you see of each one.  How important is that shared visual reference?  Hard to say, but I will note that a LOT of the Amber art out there (and there's a ton of it) tends have it's roots in Kucharski's stuff.<br/><br/>I've got a deeper theory, but it gets kind of tangential, but it boils down to this: any setting element that does not have a face is  pretty much lame.  As an example, the power of Dogs town creation is not the progression of sin itself, but rather that at the end of every step you write down an NAME, and put a face in play.  Amber, as a setting, is made almsot entirely of faces, and as such, it accidentally stumbled upon something that setting designers still haven't grasped the power of.<br/><br/>Everything should have a face.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

Make the game about relationships among very powerful, related-by-blood-and-the-body-politic peers.  Not about destroying the universe with kewl powerz.  Not about wack-ass mind-magic.  Not about everyone who isn't the players being cooler.<br/><br/>Everyone in an Amber game should be a Big Mover and Shaker -- in a world that offers plenty of competition.

                            There's a thing that's discussed in one of the Actual Play prep threads for HeroQuest's "Well of Souls" scenario that Chris wrote up.  In it, the GM says that one of the things that he required of the players, in addition to the normal chargen was (paraphrased):<br/><br/>"You have to list a relationship to three of the NPCs in the Relationship Map.  All said relationships must have something at stake/risk/going on."<br/><br/>The Family in Amber is awesome.  The campaigns I've been in or played where the players chose to tie their characters into the Family super-tight -- they rocked.  The campaigns where folks started out in the first session with no ties to anyone -- they sucked.<br/><br/>Or... most everyone rocked, and the guy with no ties struggled like mad or was bored/boring.<br/><br/>I always thought that explicitly giving folks instructions to tie into the Family (as above) would increase your odds of a successful starting session tenfold.                        </div>

                            Doesn't Fred's method sort of set up those very conflicts, depending on who chooses to the king?  It just does it without specifically declaring a relationship.<br/><br/>You select your king, you are saying "I want to be king of Amber, and if there's anyone else out there who wants it, <i>I will fight you</i>."  Then, if two players pick the king, there'll be conflict there, and now you know who you will defeat (Eric, or whoever).  If only one player picks the king, then he gets it (the throne) and now has a different relationship with [i]everyone else[/i] at the table (since both the queen and jack seem to have some relation to its rightful ruler).<br/><br/>"I am Corwin, and I will be king of Amber" is a Yawn by itself, sure, out of context with everything else Fred set up.<br/><br/>But, if you're playing Corwin, and I'm playing Eric, and we both slap down the king and say we will be king of Amber - that feels <i>exactly</i> like cooking with gas.                        </div>

                            Exactly, LX.  You hit it right on the head.  This is "Say yes or roll dice," diceless.<br/><br/>If only one player has a character who wants the throne, then why not give it to him?<br/><br/>And everyone who picks a queen?  They get to work out, for themselves, whether the guy who picked the king is rightful.  That will happen in play.<br/><br/>The ones who picked Jacks?  They have said that Amber will be destroyed.  Are they allied with the forces that will destroy Amber, or not?  All they've said is that there are forces that will destroy it, that they want the game to be ABOUT that threat, to some extent.... and that their own loyalty is in question.<br/><br/>"I am Bleys, and I will be King of Amber."<br/><br/>"I am Fiona, and I will defend Amber and her Rightful King."<br/><br/>"I am Brand, and Amber will be destroyed."<br/><br/>They are allies.                        </div>

                            The problem is that the sneaky-bastard side of Amber often starts from the instant someone finds out a game might be run. Therefore, it is entirely possible that one person will convince the rest of the group that they should all play a friendly defend-amber-from-chaos kind of game (or defend-chaos-from-amber, either way), get them all to lay down queens, and lay down a king himself. It can really annoy the other players. Some good GM/PC advice should be added to the book to cover this sort of thing, because such "reveals" become one of the sneakiest parts of character creation.<br/><br/>Also, Vax, have you decided whether you're going to allow PCs from Chaos? Will they use the same deck? (Will they be playing with a full deck?) (Is anyone in Amber playing with a full deck?) (I'll be here all week, try the veal.)                        </div>

                            My problem with that is that it turns things from character conflict to player conflict. I'm a big believer that the conflict in Amber should stay at the character level. You're saying that if you play a Queen, you decide who the rightful heir is - presumably you can't pick yourself - which could put you on the side of any King or Jack. Why are all the Queens against the single King? Because their players are angry at the King's player? That's not a very convincing motivation in-game... <br/><br/>Alternatively, could there be a method for changing your face card? For having a "hidden card" that is your real self, while the face card tells everyone else what you project?                        </div>

                            Why do you presume that the person who plays a queen can't pick who their character believes the rightful king is?<br/><br/>That being said, yes, there should be a mechanism for changing one's stance.

                            I think that conflict in ADRP should stay at the character level, but that's 'cause there's nothing to fall back on for anything more - it's all arguing with the GM over who's got the coolest idea.<br/><br/>With a <i>system</i>, on the other hand, I believe you can handle friendly competition on the player level in an enjoyable manner.  People can play on opposite teams in football and still remain good friends, or play, say, Diplomacy and walk away all laughing, I don't see why the same can't be done in Amber.                        </div>

                            The usual suspects here. <br/><br/>Having the elders in play is not a problem, unless they are used like the elder vampires in the WOD to force plot on the players. If they are simply NPCs with their own agendas, and those agendas are used by the GM to empower players to create plot? Then it's all good. It's only when the GM uses such characters as a blunt instrument to keep the players in line that it becomes an issue. <br/><br/><br/>Fred, I think a better way to state Tony's concern is that, the way you present the mechanic here, it looks like players can choose to avoid intra-character conflict. If, in fact, the setting is all about these characters, then this could be a huge problem. If, on the other hand, you can set up conflict through the Elders, or other NPCs, then it's not such a big problem. But it couldn't hurt to try to slant things so that the players are in conflict. <br/><br/>I think this would both be in the spirit of Amber, and effective. No, that's not the same thing as saying that everyone is always out to screw you. In fact, what I'd advocate is the idea way up above where every relationship is it's own character sheet. No, this doesn't mean that the relationships have to be static. In fact, the way that I envision it, play would be, in fact, solely about how those relationships are changing mechanically in play. <br/><br/>Consider this like it would be in Hero Quest for a moment (sorry for using my favorite example). You have all sort of relationships like "Corwin once nearly killed me" and "Corwin and I have been allies in the past" and "Corwin and I once were in love with X." Like in HQ, these abilities do not proscribe the player in playing the character. They're just there to offer incentives to play to them. But what's fun is going against these types when it's appropriate. And then mechanically altering the relationships to represent the new situation as it emerges. <br/><br/>The "fruitful void" in this case is not "what is the relationship?" but "how will the relationship change, or not change, over time?" <br/><br/>Now you're talking. In a world where characters have as vast powers as the Amberites do, play can't be about who is better than who at what. Benedict is defeated solely by a relationship in losing his hand in the example given above. In another case due to taunting he's bested because he can be lead to ground he's no good fighting on. In fact, the entirity of the drama is based on who is willing to do what to whom and why. Not if they can. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            There's a concept here that has been left out.  You only have a piece of the mechanic here, so of course you have concerns.<br/><br/>There's also going to be a role that has a different declaration.  One or more players can say, "I am the Serpent, and I am Chaos."  This is the player whose job it is to create disposable NPC's, organizations, situations, etc. to oppose the PC's.  He also mediates trump calls, keeps track of which NPC's know which secrets and who they've told them to, that sort of thing.  He doesn't have the kind of conflict-resolution power that an ADRP GM has, but he does have much of the situation creation power.<br/><br/>It's his job to push the PC's into conflict, if not with each other then with his NPC's.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>In the absence of the NPCs, Amber isn't much of a setting at all, literally.  There are only a handful of things in the books of any import that are not people, and most of those are tied to somebody.  A lot of the reason it's still around is on the strength of it's characters and the fact the one of Zelazny's greatest strengths as an author is expressing a very full character in a very short time.<br/><br/>Now, you will absolutely find that some folks disagree, and many Amber games have successfully disposed of the canon's NPCs, but you'll also find that most such games have done so in such a way to take advantage of the resonance chamber their absence creates.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting, the core book provides three different version of each named NPC, and almost every game I've ever played has customized them further.  Zelazny created some wonderfully _essential_ character, to such an extent that drastic changes in power, motives and interests can be made without rendering the character unrecognizable.  The upshot of this (combined with a mechanical system almost entirely lacking in dependancies) is that Amber is probably the most customized-yet-still-recognizable game in existence.  This fact has a lot to do with why some awesome games (like Matt Snyder's<i>9 Worlds</i>) which seem almost perfect for this (enthusiastic, passionate) demographic have not moved th eneedle at all.<br/><br/>In short: Amber is very, very, very weird.</blockquote>
Excellent summary.<br/><br/>It's a game about family and relationships. Anyone distracted by the setting and color isn't really getting the game. My not so humble opinion.                        </div>

                            Mmm. Sure.<br/><br/>Upwind lots of comments talk about it. Giving the NPCs and Family relationships a 'face' is "imagination as system" to me.<br/>Providing for shadow creation by Players. Providing for legends surrounding the items/artifacts/creatures that are attached to your PC is another imaginative system use.<br/><br/>A lot of this is seamless with the game system and *very* easy to explain to Players. It is also even easier for the GM to "cost out" elements that Players describe as part of their character. You can carry those rules in your head, just about.<br/><br/>Zelazny's mastery of the character sketch sets up the NPCs. Then Wujcik steps in and gives you three or so versions of those elder NPCs that could make sense to the setting. Again this sets an "imagination system choices" and reinforces the magic of the author's theme of mystery and "peeling an onion" to discover what the family is *really* like and what relationships are *really* important. Every campaign 'Benedict' is supposed to be owned by the PCs as distinct and unique to their relationships. Customization is king.<br/><br/>The GM notes talk about conflicts and significance a bit. Imagination overcomes obstacles. Imagination evens disadvantage in combat. Imagination finds new uses for Attribute skills. Imagination is the secret most important attribute.<br/><br/>Every character is a badass in their own mind.<br/>You can find almost anything you can imagine.                        </div>

<p>I'd add in (to the very good stuff that Arref pointed out) that in most of the games I've given a flying fig about, the imagination is <em>also</em> the character development system.  Or, rather, characters develop through the fact of having a history.</p>
<p>If my guy Lysander gets 16 XPs and buys a deadly-damage blade (or whatever) ... eh.  Nobody really cares.  I've seen it over and over again.</p>
<p>If I <strong>take Oberon's sword</strong> and wilfully use it in battle against the rightful King then even after they take away the sword, throw me in prison, genetically revert me to a five year old body and have my deeds stricken from the record books, I am still the guy who wielded father's sword.  Nobody is ever going to forget that.  Ever.  They're always going to have conversations that go like "Come on ... even Lysander wouldn't go that far," "Are you kidding?  There's no limit to how far he'll go if the rage is upon him."</p>
<p>You make your character more powerful by making him more of an inspiration to the other players.  That's fun.</p>
