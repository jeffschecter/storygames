(Our last session is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5250" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)  To kick things off on a cheery note, I played a portion of the Radio Lightning broadcast and the appropriate documentary clips from the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.warsawuprising.com" rel="nofollow">Warsaw Uprising</a> website.  Hearing the sound of the Stukas screaming from the sky was an appropriate mood setter for the evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, after an impromptu political discussion, we got down to brass tacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Session Two:  Uprising</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<i> Chapter 4:  Desperate Street Fighting</i><br/>\n<br/>\nMission Leader:  Keith<br/>\n<br/>\nSituation elements:<br/>\nMaria Dunajewsky, English teacher and dirty traitor<br/>\nThe Chestnut Caf\xe9 in the yard of the Deaf and Dumb Institute<br/>\nA flamboyant bouquet of cheap flowers<br/>\nA group of Home Army troops has been cut off and is trapped in the sewers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mission was immediately obvious.  Keith told us about the group of Home Army troops and how we were being sent to locate them and guide them out of the sewers.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Side note:  on the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.warsawuprising.com" rel="nofollow">Warsaw Uprising</a> website, I read someone\u2019s account of being trapped in the sewers.  The Germans were dumping water and chemicals into the sewers to make them impassable.  Then, when people would come out of the sewers in German-held territory, soldiers were waiting to gun them down.  The man writing about his experience wandered for two and a half days in the sewers of Warsaw.  Cheery.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, of course, we sent Leon down the manhole first to scout ahead.  Keith contributed his d8 to the mission pool and told us how he ran into German sentries in the sewers and was captured.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>In the meantime, I called for my personal scene.  Chapter 4 is the day after Chapter 3, so Plug and Gigant were still dancing around the fact that Gigant had beaten up Plug the day before.  So Gigant tries to patch things up with Plug, talking about how they could die today and he didn\u2019t want this sitting between them.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  patch things up with Plug.)  I rolled a d6 and failed, so Plug blew off Gigant.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, the string that Leon was running behind him went slack.  Something is wrong.  So Gigant takes the crew\u2019s one rifle and an oil lamp and descends into the sewer to rescue him.  I contribute a d6 to the mission pool and say how Gigant is fumbling with the light and rifle, but manages to shoot the one German and knock the other one out by using the rifle as a club.  I\u2019m making this sound all heroic; it wasn\u2019t.  Gigant was scared and desperate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>At the same time, Leon is cowering in the water, trying to be brave.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  don\u2019t be a coward)  Keith rolled a d4 and failed, so Leon yields to his cowardice while Gigant fought the Germans.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the rest of the crew heard the gunshot, Ola ordered Plug to go down and help Gigant.  But Plug wasn\u2019t having any of it.  Ralph contributed a d10 to the mission pool and described how Plug actually deserted, walking away from the rest of the crew.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>So Plug is outside the crew\u2019s HQ, grumbling and kicking at stones, when Edmund Telakowski comes out of the building, weapon in hand.  He sees Plug and wants to know why he isn\u2019t with the crew.  When Plug gives some moan story, Edmund knew that Plug needed some encouragement.  So he tells him about the need to defend Mother Poland and how the greater good requires his sacrifices.  (Goal of Personal scene:  Shore up Plug\u2019s flagging patriotism).  Ralph rolled a d6 and fails.  So Plug blows off Edmund, too.  Edmund stiffens and says, \u201cAt least I am doing my duty\u201d and hurries off.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Ola knows that she needs to go after Gigant.  So down the sewers she goes.  Crystal contributed a d8 to the mission pool and Keith rolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailure.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal exposed her Thing Held Dear to reroll one of the dice, but it wasn\u2019t enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Crystal narrated how Ola bumped into Gigant in the dark while he was dragging Leon out.  Since they couldn\u2019t see each other, Gigant lashed out, elbowing Ola in the forehead, knocking her out.  So, once again, Gigant is lugging something.  (I joked that one of his Reputations should have been \u201cpack mule\u201d).<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>After the mission, Ola returns home to find a bouquet of flowers from Hans and a letter, saying how he could get them out of the city.  So Ola decides to lay plans with Hans to escape Warsaw.  (Goal of Personal scene:   use this opportunity to gather information to help her friends.)  Crystal rolled a d6 and failed.  So she threatened her Thing Held Dear for a d12 and the reroll, which gave her success.  So she did the right thing, although she wrote about her moment of weakness in her journal.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI <i>think</i> that Crystal singled out Leon to get him further away from the corner, but I don\u2019t remember for sure.  (I forgot to include this in my notes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith deliberately set himself up to fail his Personal scene, because of his Grid position.  Otherwise, he would have visited a second corner and been written out.  This would not be the first time that Grid strategy would shape our stories.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119567/#Comment_119567" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T22:19:53+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 10:19PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i> Chapter 5:  The High Water Mark of the Uprising</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI was the mission leader for this Chapter.<br/>\n<br/>\nSituation Elements:<br/>\nA root cellar containing a happy surprise<br/>\nBetrayal<br/>\nMother, we\u2019re young and need to have fun<br/>\nA picnic basket with chocolate bars, salami, fresh fruit, wine, and a glass container of laudanum<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mission was straightforward.  Somehow the Germans had discovered our crew\u2019s little HQ.  We needed to evacuate and re-establish ourselves somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe jumped right into the middle of the action.  Here come the Germans!  Edward started barking orders.  Ola leaped into action.  Crystal contributed a d6 to the mission pool and described how Ola destroyed various sensitive documents that we didn\u2019t want in German hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, Plug had run outside to try to stop the Germans.  He and Danka took up firing positions and began firing at the oncoming Germans.  Ralph contributed a d10 to the mission pool and described how Plug actually managed to get one of the Germans.  But when he turned to Danka to celebrate, she was spread-eagled in the middle of the road, already dead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Gigant takes his personal scene.  He\u2019s holding a club and is about to charge into combat.  He pulls out a locket from under his shirt and kisses it.  Flashback to last summer on the farm.  Gigant is sitting at dinner, talking to several of the other students on the farm.  One of them is a girl named Honoratka, who happens to be Danka\u2019s sister.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  impress Honoratka in conversation).  I rolled a d8 and failed, so I exposed my Thing Held Dear and rerolled with a d12.  Success.  So, despite some social awkwardness, Honoratka actually finds Gigant endearing.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nEdward grabs Leon.  \u201cDistract those Germans!  Now!\u201d  With that, he gave Leon a shove into the street.  The Germans saw him, and there was only one thing to do:  run.  Keith donated a d6 to the mission pool.  So, Leon gave them a good chase, eventually leading them into the cellar with the dog fight pits.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, Gigant suddenly sees Germans coming out of the HQ building, dragging Edmund with them.  They are forming up an impromptu firing squad.  I contributed a d8 to the mission pool, and then I rolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I narrated how Edmund looked up and made eye contact with Gigant, who could only watch in horror.<br/>\n<br/>\nA sound of gunfire.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe crew was scattered to the four winds without central command and communications.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Leon is foraging for food while he is out in the city.  He spies a basket of food on a window sill and decides to steal it.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  have the food be from a German, not a Pole.)  Keith rolled a d8 and succeeded.  So Leon makes off with the food, having not compromised his principles.</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>After the demoralizing defeat, Ola flees back to her home.  She is discouraged and really just wants to connect with her mother.  Sure, she\u2019s been trying to make her parents mad, but now she suddenly wants their love and attention.  So she goes to her mom and wants to spend some time, playing a game like they did when they were younger.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  connect with her mother).  Crystal rolls a d4 and fails.  So Ralph destroyed her Thing Held Dear to have her reroll with a d12.  She still failed.  So Ola\u2019s mother is too busy with important work and cannot spend the time with Ola.  So she goes up to her room in utter despair.  She takes her journal and throws it away.  Her friends are lost to her.  Her family no longer cares.  Only one person really cares about her anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nHans. </i><br/>\n<br/>\nI singled out Plug for this Chapter.  I don\u2019t remember why; he may simply have been the least bad of the available options.<br/>\n<br/>\nOla\u2019s personal scene was fascinating.  By having her Thing Held Dear destroyed (her friends), she was actually turning her back on her peer group.  It could have been a moment of reconciliation and restoration with her family.  It could have been a moment of growing maturity.  Instead, the moment passed, and Ola fled to the arms of Hans.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, I <b>needed</b> to win that personal scene.  Otherwise, there was no way to save me from being written out.  Singling me out would have only changed how I went out.  Again, the Grid drives our game choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119568/#Comment_119568" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T22:20:08+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 10:20PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i> Chapter 6:  German Tanks against Home-made Rifles</i><br/>\n<br/>\nRalph was the mission leader for this Chapter.<br/>\n<br/>\nSituation Elements:<br/>\nBritish and Polish Air Force are making poorly-aimed supply drops<br/>\nA hole dug in to the foundation of the Peiffer tannery<br/>\nThe ruins of your living room<br/>\nSomebody is pregnant<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mission wasn\u2019t really a formal thing.  Instead, the crew is working on its own initiative, trying to recover some of the air-dropped supplies that landed in German territory.  We\u2019re running out of food, and we\u2019re hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Ralph calls for his personal scene right away.  Plug is at Ola\u2019s house, trying to find her.  Instead, all he finds is rubble.  The Stuka attacks of the day before have leveled the house.  He scrambles through the wreckage, looking for her.  Instead, he finds the journal and, reading it, discovers about Hans.  (Goal for Personal Scene:  go rescue Ola.)  Ralph rolled a d8 and was successful.  So Plug heads off to find Ola and rescue her from Hans.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Plug and Gigant are heading into German territory.  Gigant is carrying a machine gun that he took from a dead German soldier.  So, when they find a group of German soldiers working on recovering an air-dropped crate, Gigant sets up and opens fire.  I contributed a d10 to the mission pool.  So, sure, Gigant gunned down the Germans.  But he went berserk, shredding the crate into splinters with the machine gun and attracting the attention of a nearby halftrack.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>On Black Saturday, the SS caught Leon\u2019s mother out in the open.  Leon was nearby and tried to help.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  save mother from SS.)  Keith rolled a d4 and failed.  Leon watches as the Germans gun down his mother.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nLeon was captured, and now the Germans are pumping him for information.  Keith contributed a d10 to the mission pool.  Leon broke down and spilled everything.  Names, places, all of it.  Troops were dispatched to various locations, including Ola\u2019s house, where they captured Ola\u2019s mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Crystal was very clear that there was a veil over the next scene.  But Ola and Hans sleep together.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  don\u2019t get pregnant.)  Crystal rolled a d6 and failed.  So Ola is now pregnant with Hans\u2019 child.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOla and Hans poked their heads out of the tent in the German encampment to see Ola\u2019s mother being marched in one direction with an interested officer reading Ola\u2019s journal walking in the other direction.  Ola begged Hans for help.  Crystal contributed a d8 to the mission pool and narrated how Hans was able to get her mother free by knifing one of the other German soldiers.  But the Germans now have the contents of the journal, including Hans\u2019 identity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Flashback.  It\u2019s the last night on the farm, and Gigant is going to have to say goodbye to Honoratka.  Of course, it\u2019s that first awkward kiss thing.  (Goal of Personal Scene: kiss Honoratka.)  I rolled a d6 and failed.  Honoratka is sorry (and probably a little flustered).  She just wants to be friends.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nPlug disguised himself in a German uniform taken from a dead soldier and worked his way into the German camp.  Ralph contributed a d8 to the mission pool and rolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Keith exposed Leon\u2019s Thing Held Dear for a reroll with a d12.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuccess.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it\u2019s about time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Ralph narrated how Plug was able to locate Ola, just as she was leaving with Hans.  So he didn\u2019t actually make contact with her, but he was able to steal a halftrack with food and such in it and drive it back into Warsaw.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, Leon was still sitting in the German camp.  Looking out the window, he could see the sun glinting off the spires of St. John\u2019s Cathedral, and he cursed his cowardice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Ralph singled out Leon, but I don\u2019t remember for sure.  The important take-away point is that we stared at the Grid, trying to figure out the best possible dice that we could eke out of the Grid and eventually singling out whoever it was on the basis of that dice strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I don\u2019t have the order of those personal scenes quite right, except for Ralph\u2019s.  Oh well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119569/#Comment_119569" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T22:20:22+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 10:20PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Post Game Reflection</b><br/>\n<br/>\nYeah.  It felt much better this time around.  Jason was right; things <i>do</i> start clicking more in Session 2.  Here are some thoughts from the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that chronology was important.  Chapter 3 is Tuesday, August 1.  Chapter 4 is Wednesday, August 2.  Chapter 5 is Friday, August 4.  Chapter 6 is Monday, August 7.  In other words, Session 2 (Chapters 4-6) is only five days long.  And yet it takes up a third of the game.  The power that only a few days can have on a life\u2026.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, it meant that there wasn\u2019t a lot of time to resolve long-term issues and grudges.  So, for example, you see the immediate aftermath of Gigant\u2019s assault on Plug.  Time may heal all wounds, but there\u2019s actually not a lot of time in Session 2 of Grey Ranks.  The action comes fast and furious, and the emotional impact can be a little overwhelming, actually.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, the upshot of all this:  pay attention to the dates in Radio Lightning.  They are an important part of the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other news, we started wrapping our minds around the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a seriously slick game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the escalating difficulty meshes nicely with the dice probabilities.  The game gives the players the tools to grab the larger dice, mostly by pushing Reputations.  Of course, that won\u2019t be <i>quite</i> enough, but it\u2019s not quite as overwhelming as it first appears.  Instead, the escalating difficulty enforces the necessity of constantly developing your Reputations and improving your Grid position.  Plus, in a pinch, you can always burn extra Reputation dice to grab that big d10, and there\u2019s always all those Things Held Dear out there.  Now, we haven\u2019t hit the crunch of Session 3 yet, but at this point, I\u2019d say that the difficulty number <i>for missions</i> usually feels just barely out of reach, but never completely impossible.  I\u2019ll let you know if I still think this after Session 3<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also figured out that you could somewhat dictate the outcome of a mission scene, simply by noting which dice were available to a player.  So, if my remaining die is a d10, you know that whatever mission scene you give to me will end in abject failure.  Therefore, you can hand me a mission scene that you would like to see end in failure for dramatic reasons and be assured that it will go mostly the way that you think it should.  This is very cool.  We used this to good effect, as I will discuss in a moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Grid is a work of genius.  Jason, our hats are off to you.  At the end of the game, Ralph picked up the Grid and said that the thought process that produced the Grid was totally alien to him.  Never in a thousand years would he have thought of something like this.  I concur.  (Yes, I know that <i>Dirty Secrets</i> has a Grid.  That\u2019s different.)  The Grid is so central to the game, and yet it took us all of last session to come to understand why.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the Grid gives you reasons to choose failure.  Too much of either failure or success is bad.  Staying near the center is better.  Sometimes, this means trying to fail either your personal scene or the mission.  So far, I don\u2019t <i>think</i> that anyone has tried to spike the mission for his own benefit; personally, I think that we would probably gut anyone who tried.  Uh, not to be violent about it or anything.  But Keith actually needed very badly to fail a personal scene to keep Leon in the game.  Of course, the results in the fiction aren\u2019t really pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, the Grid incorporates a fairly nasty death spiral, but in a completely productive way.  If you look at the Grid, you\u2019ll see that the upper left corner has better dice than the lower right corner.  Sure, extremes are dangerous, but, if you need to pick an extreme, enthusiasm and love are generally more productive.  Of course, moving this direction requires success on both mission and personal scenes.  As you lose, you slip lower and lower on the Grid, which gives you worse dice, making it harder to climb out\u2026.  It\u2019s possible to break out using Reputations or Things Held Dear, or you can be really daring and slip through a corner, so you\u2019re not completely trapped by the death spiral.  However, I was impressed that the engine that runs the game is actually a death spiral.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, Jason, we salute you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>A word on bleakness</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I figured that I\u2019d give a special word to the reputation that this game has earned as being bleak.  It is certainly heavy material, and the situations are often intense and heavy.  However, I do not think that it\u2019s fair to depict this game as being bleak and hopeless.  In fact, there\u2019s an odd joy in crafting a good heartbreaking scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nGigant\u2019s mission scene in Chapter 5 is a perfect example of this.  Ralph looked over at my sheet, saw that I only had a d8, and said, \u201cHere\u2019s your scene.  They\u2019re dragging out Edmund and putting together an impromptu firing squad.  They\u2019re going to fire in five\u2026four\u2026three\u2026\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was nothing that I could do.  We both knew that; it was a d8.  But it was <i>exactly the right scene</i>, for both the situation and the character.  As soon as Ralph framed the scene, I knew what needed to happen.  So while Ralph was counting down, I described Edmund meeting Gigant\u2019s eyes, and then the gunfire.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal said, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible!\u201d  Ralph and I gave each other a fist pound.  Because, yes, it was horrible, and yes, Ralph technically backed me into a corner.  But it\u2019s a corner I wanted to be in, and it was a well-played scene.  And, regardless of emotional weight, there\u2019s something profoundly satisfying about a well-played scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext week we will wrap <i>Grey Ranks</i> with Session 3:  Disaster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119570/#Comment_119570" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T22:24:54+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 10:24PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Postscript:  A Funny Story</b><br/>\n<br/>\nEach time that we start, Ralph says, \u201cSo, tonight is the night that we beat the Germans and kill Hiter, right?\u201d  Because, secretly, he\u2019s hoping that somehow we\u2019ll be able to change history and save Warsaw somehow.
