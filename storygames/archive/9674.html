I have a group of people who dig on Arthurian legend, so it seemed like a good fit.<br/><br/>We ran into a few problems, however:<br/><br/>1) So many skills! And a lot of them never get used;<br/>2) Not everyone digs intense property/estates/family management, but it's probably really beneficial to know who your character is related to and how well-off your estates are. Maybe it isn't that important, but it certainly seem that way;<br/>3) Greatly not impressed by the mass combat system.<br/><br/>So, I'm thinking of trying to hack in into something a little simpler, while maintaining the parts we did like, namely the Character Traits and Passions.<br/><br/>So, here's my basic idea:<br/>1) Get rid over everything except the Traits and Passions, and just make players roll those when appropriate, instead of using them to modify skills. That means that the scene will be about "Justice" or "Piety" or whatever, rather than those things just influencing "Sword";<br/>2) Get the players who really dig the family-tree plotting to do up the whole works for everyone, letting the less-interested players off the hook;<br/>3) Reduce the complex wealth/property management system to something easier, maybe the outcome of a single die; the characters' estates will be described based on their Traits (so a Pious one might have a cathedral, a Worldly one a renowned inn).<br/><br/>My other idea is to use a rules set more like <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>, but with a little more GM control, to ensure that the big expensive hardback campaign book stays relevant. That's got duels and family trees and estates and the like. Maybe hack in the Traits from <i>Pendragon</i>.<br/><br/>Anyone have any other suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215207/#Comment_215207" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T20:47:30+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  8:47PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

All that stuff about family and estate matters because your "main" PC WILL die, and sooner than you might have hoped. That's why all that romance matters, too: you best have an heir in line before putting your life on the line, or the King will be allocating your goods to some other up-and-comer or favorite.\n<blockquote>3) Greatly not impressed by the mass combat system.</blockquote>I need to re-read closely (getting to it, getting to it...) but I never though of Pendragon as a game about that anyway. Mass combats are backdrops for the one-on-one clash of the major players; it's not Warhammer, after all.<br/><br/>Maybe you should just setting-drift a game which has a system that suits your vision of the scope and scale of play you want?\n<blockquote>So, I'm thinking of trying to hack in into something a little simpler, while maintaining the parts we did like, namely the Character Traits and Passions.<br/>...<br/>1) Get rid over everything except the Traits and Passions, and just make players roll those when appropriate, instead of using them to modify skills.

Or maybe The Blossoms are Falling (Honor elements) with the Oriental serial numbers filed off?<br/><br/>Just some thoughts about hacking TO Pendragon, rather than away from it. Compare and contrast how much of the game book you'd still use if hacked down, compared ot how much of the BW or TBAF books you'd use drifting....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215412/#Comment_215412" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T11:24:35+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 11:24AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David: I should probably clarify; I definitely WANT to keep the family/estate thing, it's just that there never seems to be enough front-loaded detail unless I have overachiever players. So I figure I'll let the overachievers crank out everyone's family tree right off the start, and then the dabblers can fill in the details and take over management of the session-to-session stuff.<br/><br/>I don't think BW will do what I want it to do, since I already have troubles with that system for much of my play. I'd prefer something much simpler.<br/><br/>As for hacking to Pendragon, my two top picks are Houses of the Blooded or Reign, since both have estates-management that I think is done better.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Mass combats are backdrops for the one-on-one clash of the major players</blockquote>\nIf only this were true! The system as-written results in PCs fighting random mooks most of the time, and the mooks don't have a health stat, so you basically fight them until the battle is over or you die. Now, obviously I can always sub in the appropriate enemy, but if I'm going to do that, I might as well re-jig the system to something I like more.<br/><br/>Also, one of my most basic hacks comes from my dislike of roll-under. Most Pendragon stats are rated 1-20, so if I keep the core of the system I'll just use 1d20 + stat, target number 20.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
