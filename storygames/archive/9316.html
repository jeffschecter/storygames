When I first heard him talking about it I was mildly excited as it sounded at first hearing like something approaching a role-playing game as I understood the term - wow! (so to speak).Please don't shake heads in disbelief - this I suppose really shows how out of touch I am with everything computer and RPG-related since up to now I didn't even know of the existance of World of Warcraft.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I'm going to sound very clueless when I say that I am, of course, disappointed with what WoW actually is. Now, please correct me if I'm wrong, but is the game just accountancy, following routines and procedures and collecting ragged wolf pelts? Is there any kind of exciting player interaction to be had? Is it just me or is the entire format of a MMORPG just doomed to failure for interactive play? I mean, the graphics make it look like, oooh, a 'real world' you can immerse yourself in - I was impressed with the look of the thing, initially, as a mildly computer-illierate old guy. The whole experience, as I fleetingly took it in from watching his play seems to promise lots and deliver drudgery.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question to computer-savvy people is this - and please, please forgive me if this is out of the remit of this site - does an online game exsist that does over a genuinely 'interactive' or 'role-play'-like experience? To clarify, what I mean is - does an online game exsist where it feels like a story is developing that the players are creating together? Is there a game that offers the chance to interact with other characters and feel more like a story-game? Maybe one that even includes a lush graphics-laden front end?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, is there a site or piece of software which allows text-based interaction between people? Does an e-mail program suit the purpose well?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm hoping for here is a little discussion of how I might approach online gaming, or a nudge in the direction of a thread discussing it. I hope this is not off-topic and a legitimate question to raise.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206527/#Comment_206527" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T00:57:54+00:00" title="May 10, 2009 12:57AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Re: MMOs that offer collaborative story development - Unfortunately no, not at this time.

AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Instant Messenger, IRC (in its sundry forms) ICQ, even Google Talk are all good for this. I've found AIM and IRC to be the best for chatroom roleplay. There are also virtual tabletops that allow some sort of graphical interaction alongside the text-based chat. There are also a few decent voice-chat programs that are good for RP as well. E-mail and message boards are used frequently for "play-by-post" games where trying to schedule a time to get everyone together is more hassle than you have time for.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206530/#Comment_206530" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T01:19:27+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  1:19AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are also text-based "MU*s", meaning MUSHs, MUXs, etc. Check out <a href="http://www.mudconnector.com" rel="nofollow">MudConnector</a> for the very wide variety of these.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oreso" title="oreso"><img alt="oreso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oreso">oreso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206532/#Comment_206532" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T01:47:56+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  1:47AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2009 1:50AM by oreso.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I roleplay quite a lot on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.cityofheroes.com/" rel="nofollow">City of Heroes</a> on the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://union.virtueverse.com/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Union</a> server, which has a fairly large number of roleplayers on it. (In the US, the RP server is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://virtueverse.com/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Virtue</a>, I think)<br/>\n<br/>\nReasons being:<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter creation is extremely flexible, meaning that most heroes (and villains) look distinct from each other and you can represent a broad range of in-fiction backgrounds (mystic wolfman, time-travelling cyborg, guy who can shoot good, time-traveling cybernetic wolfman who can shoot good, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nEach Supergroup (a player created guild) can have a base, and it is also extremely flexible. In a large Roleplaying Supergroup you can expect to find a massive complex with a bar and other recreational areas, perhaps personal living space, a tech lab, an arcane library, etc, etc. It takes some expertise and trickery, but you can even make things like decent looking high-rise flats, swimming pools, hanger bays, gardens, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, players can now create their own missions and story arcs, using the Mission Architect. Everything from the dialogue, what the baddies look like, where the mission takes place, what the mission objectives are, etc is now in player's hands. This is fantastic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, there are still limitations, but we find using a forum is good to arrange these in-game events, and we have an out-of-character chat channel, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example (excuse my gushing):<br/>\nIn an ongoing arc with my supergroup, the demonic power that fuels our leader's abilities became dominant (for an in-fiction reason), so after trashing the base (editing it slightly) and some roleplay, he went AWOL and someone else assumed leadership. All in roleplay: The new leader organised a meeting, and we decided our plan of action to track him down before he A) does any harm to himself <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> harms our supergroups reputation. On the forums, we narrated what our characters were doing to track him down. Now, the ex-leader's player is using the Mission Architect to create a suitably dramatic story arc where we will bust in, disrupt whatever evil schemes he's been up to (which have been hinted at from interaction on the forums), and then fight an NPC copy of him (with identical appearance and powers, custom dialogue, etc). While his main character is unavailable for casual roleplay, the ex-leader's player is simply playing as another character.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut-of-character-ly, I have arranged to introduce a new character I want to play by also putting him in that story arc as a boss type character. He's an indignant demon that has been bound in a magical cloak. I don't know anything else about the mission yet, but I've supplied the dialogue and appearance too. Excellent stuff for me: I get a nice dramatic intro for my character.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile all this is going on, there's lots of individual smaller character-developing sub-plots going on (not usually planned, just naturally developing from the free roleplay).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's different from tabletop, and you have to hunt it down, but you can definitely roleplay in a satisfying way in an MMO, or at least, this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206534/#Comment_206534" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T03:37:44+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  3:37AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Richard (oreso), that's awesome.

You can manipulate the environment in a way that is conducive to RP, but it isn't the same as the game offering collaborative story. You can do it yourself, and some games give you some sort of tools to do it (UO was one of the better ones early on, and SWG was doing a decent job of it before the NGE) but the games themselves don't really encourage it.</p>\n<p>What is needed, I think, for an MMO to really encourage collaborative story in the TTRPG sense is to allow the players to affect the actual world. I don't mean creating missions/quests* and building houses, but to take the setting properties down off the pedestal, and put them within the players' reach. Let a villain plot to blow up a building actually demolish that building if it succeeds. If the heroes save someone, let the NPCs talk about it... even when that hero ISN'T passing by. I want to be able to keep hearing about some hero that's been doing good work in an area, then when I meet them, it's like "Dude, I know you! All the people on Talos Island are talking about how you took down the Tsoo!"</p>\n<p>But that's difficult to do with thousands of players on a server. The mission building in CoX is a step in the right direction, for certain. But it's a small step. EVE is doing other things right, like the detailed "corporation" system, and the incredibly strong player-based economy. Baby steps. The main problem is that majority of people don't want to roleplay in their MMOs, even tabletop roleplayers. They just want to play a video game in a massively multiplayer environment. While that's true, there won't be a big push toward expanding features that facilitate RP.</p>\n<p>*For the record, Saga of Ryzom, a semi-obscure MMO of French origins, did it years before CoX. I can't say anything about how well they did it, as I barely poked around with it, but they did it first.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206543/#Comment_206543" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T07:08:04+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  7:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Player-authored storylines that can be shared with anyone is a small step?

I find it makes a large difference to the replayibility and the unique feeling if each character if each character actually ends up aquiring different quests and such.  Wow has a glimpse into this (with their reputation system ) but the flat +/-  and linear aspect of that when combined with the fact that they strive to make all quests playible by all members of a side, leads to a very homoginous feel. ( I tend to only play wow to play with my friends, because while the game is fun, I perfer diablo II because at least i get to feel like a big damn hero at the end of it )<br><br>This interactivity could be achieved by player created content, or it could just be the work of game designers from the begining (my biggest compleignt in these kind of games is that in a game where it takes a few weeks to hit max level, playing quite often a day, the designers think that 'adding new impressive content' is congruant with 'adding high level content'. If I could get a new 10, 20, 30 and 40 dungeon or area every month I would be playing it alot more regardless of who made that area.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206548/#Comment_206548" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T08:18:54+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  8:18AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Often, when people ask for "real roleplaying", what they want is to have higher stakes of ownership and responsibility in the game. But this is difficult for MMO games, as they have to cater to a wide base of paying customers. Allowing "real" consequences to actions (in the sense that they'd impact anything but your own play) means that other players could influence your play. In my experience most online gamers are pretty wussy about this sort of thing, they don't like it when somebody else comes along and "ruins their game". It's pretty impossible to allow real interaction and real consequences while simultaneously protecting everybody's investment into the game - it'd require a player population and a gaming ethos that is not present in current MMO environment. As it is, almost anything persistent you'd allow a player to do in the game could potentially trample on what somebody else perceives as their fun. Burn a building, and there's somebody else out there who is now lacking a building. In a game that has no point aside from character development these set-backs are not "play" - they're setbacks, just like if your computer crashed. I'm not surprised that MMO designers explicitly limit player interaction with setting and each other to mutually agreed-upon forms.<br><br>Tabletop gamers rarely think about it, but they're actually pretty well off - there's no problem at all with having your character assassinate the king and instigate a civil war on tabletop; your freedom is absolute, the spotlight is always on you, nobody is going to complain that you ruined the game for the thousands of NPCs affected by your choices. MMO gamers are the tenant farmers of an imaginary world in comparison, with limited and carefully enumerated privileges. It's no wonder if that leaves something to be desired for tabletop adventurers.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206549/#Comment_206549" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T08:20:20+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  8:20AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are forums that offer chat-based "freeform" roleplaying.

There were love triangles, petty jealousies, attempted coups, assassinations, and courtships, and they were all in character.<br><br>Second life has a hell of a lot of potential for good roleplaying, and perhaps it already has some, but I haven't found it yet.<br><br><strong>Virtual Tabletops</strong><br><br>I've played in some AWESOME games using virtual tabletops: <i>My Life with Master</i>, <i>Zorcerer of Zo</i> and <i>Risus</i> in Fantasy Grounds, <i>Primetime Adventures </i>and <i>Grey Ranks </i>in Vassal, <i>In a Wicked Age</i> using MapTool.<br/><br/><strong>EpicTable</strong><br/><br/>Just over a year ago, I noticed a post over on Four Ugly Monsters by a guy (John Lammers) who was producing a VT. He asked what people wanted out of a VT, and most answered along the lines of "we don't need another VT, so don't bother."<br/><br/>My answer was a bit different. I told him about an entire subculture of games that aren't really supported well by VTs that are designed for d20. I invited him to join me in a few indie/narrative/story games using VTs, and he was hooked. A year later, he's as obsessed with these games as I am.<br/><br/>He's now getting ready for an alpha release. He's designed the dice system so you can push dice around on a table for games like <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, so it will drop 4s for <i>My Life with Master</i>. You can pass around tokens as fate points and fan mail. His "dice cup" will let you design damn near any type of roll you like. He's creating a character sheet editor so you can import an image and place editable text and image fields on it. You can move around minis and share handouts. There is a running log of chat and actions for actual play posts.<br/><br/>John is working with several designers to build support for many well loved indie/story/narrative/fiction games into the initial release.

I think a virtual tabletop is certainly something I will investigate. Does 4th Edition D&amp;D/Gleemax thing do this? I seem to remember that the virtual tabletop was the big feature when 4th Edition came out but I didn't really take any notice at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the comments above have got me thinking more in depth about this - especially about the fact that MANY other people are sharing the space - I hadn't really thought about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think I have made clear what was bubbling around in my head though when I first asked the question. I initially looked at the game of WoW being played and on the surface, it looks very impressive from a by-stander's point of view - I saw good-looking locations: valleys, pits of fire, huge citadels etc and thought it looked very 'fantasy', which appealed to me. I thought: online game, lots of player from around the world - it MUST involve 'role-playing' as I understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I watched the sequence of play, however, that's when I got dissillusioned. Now, I don't know if it's the way my son's playing, or if it's just the way it goes but here's what I saw happening, in brief chunks as I walked in and out the room. He creates/picks a character, then goes out EVERY time fighting young wolves, trogg babies, or an equivalent beast till he's killed ten of them. Then he goes running off to a home village or city and pokes about there looking for someone to train him to the next level, or to sell some weird stuff he's picked up from wolf corpses. When he talks to someone, it's a little typed comment in the corner of the screen concerning some technicality of playing the game. All in all the impression of the game that I got was you have very set and repetative actions you HAVE to do to get a very set reward, and the whole point of the game is to repeat these very small tasks over and over to get to higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I IMAGINED would happen in the game is that there would be some kind of 'story' presented to you, or at least opportunities for stories to occur. I imagined there would be some way of speaking in character and that there would be NPCs who would be acting in character too: presenting more opportunities for plot to grow from what all the characters/players were doing in this environment. I guess I thought that WoW was an environment where people could explore and role-play and there would be some way that the computer program made role-playing possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose that a Virtual Tabletop with a real GM and players might be more what I am looking for here but that leaves me with the question what do people actually like about WoW? I just don't think I know enough about it really. I imagined maybe it would be good to have this huge modelled universe at your disposal as a playing group online. I poked about online and watched some videos of the Game Star Wars the Old Republic and I thought it would be great to have this model of the Star Wars universe that could be used to visualise a tabletop or online game but where things would be affected at a local level with one group of players as they played - with things being altered, destroyed or whatever.

The emphasis here is on interface mastery, system mastery, and <em>successful teamwork.</em> To succeed in advanced instances and raids (AFAICT a 'raid' is just an instance calling for an extra-large group and a larger block of time), you need a group that's carefully system-optimized <em>and</em> knows how to work well together.</p>\n<p>You're right, roleplaying isn't really a big deal if you're on the instance track. That part of the game really emphasizes the 'character as pawn' attitude.</p>\n<p>There're some sandbox elements like crafting, the auction house economy, and the occasional opportunities to get on on side or another of a running faction war, but it's not really systemically possible for software-supported roleplay that incorporates the NPCs to exist. I don't even know how you'd begin to handle the storage burden of that, let alone the problem of designing those interactions.</p>\n<p>Have you looked at the RP servers, though?

(As an aside, apart from the glut of recent crossover events, it reflects comics too. Each comic doesn't really have much effect on the status quo in other comics in the same universe).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yeah, I mean, I don't care so much what happens in the outside world, because most of my roleplay happens in player controlled spaces anyway (and the amount of control is quite impressive with the bases and missions. Not so much as Second Life of course, but, infinitely easier to use and more focused). The only other roleplay I do is in the bar, which is nifty for light social RP already (the whole bar is in a pocket dimension controlled by a powerful guy who welcomes heroes and villains and prevents any violence).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an additional aside, if you do the big anti-alien taskforce, then the aliens retaliate by attacking a whole zone, effectively closing it down for an hour or so while the heroes fight them off. So, ya know, you can have limited and predictable real consequences, but yeah. Asking for more is a bit of an impossible thing before breakfast deal, if you have a thousand players, they just can't all be big damn heroes that change the world. Plenty of tricks to make them feel like that, of course, and I support that, but I don't expect much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe EVE style player-controlled stuff bores me to tears though. When I want control and consequences over the world in my RP, I'm really really not talking about the economy and politics.

What's in my head is a system which tracks the changes in player characters or NPCs and the changes in their immediate environment made when meeting with each other, the changing relationships and the things that might become 'story hooks'. Large scale change I'm not bothered about. The trouble with this is that I'm flailing in the dark here a bit - not knowing the reference material at all. I'm not interested in 'interface mastery' or 'system mastery'. I'm not looking for a game where the system works on a total token basis - I mean, for example, needing to expend resources on food only to heal wounds and with no colour attached or narrative significance. I'm looking for something much more 'freeform' (?) or at least with the ability to be so. I just *want* there to be a big graphical computer adventure-world available which allows (or I should say enables or encourages) stories to be created.<br><br>I think the enabling environment of a VT is the nearest that exists that addresses what I'm looking for from what's being said here. Computer games have developed in a particular way - is this maybe the only way possible given the technology?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/coffeestain" title="coffeestain"><img alt="coffeestain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/coffeestain">coffeestain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206605/#Comment_206605" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T19:51:40+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  7:51PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pandelume,<br><br>This is something I'm working on right now in an interactive chat environment.
