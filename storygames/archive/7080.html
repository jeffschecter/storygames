He answered it honestly and promptly and gave a cool suggestion with how I could work around my problem. <br/><br/>This week I had a question regarding Dirty Secrets, so I fired off an email to Seth. He also answered it honestly and promptly and gave me some useful advice for my situation. I'm playing that game tomorrow.<br/><br/>The point? I love the fact that I had these questions regarding the games I wanted to play and I felt comfortable sending out an email to the game's creator. I also love that I then get awesome customer service. Seriously, that kind of customer service jazzes me up to play the games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157578/#Comment_157578" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-20T06:58:03+00:00" title="July 20, 2008  6:58AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2008 6:58AM by Moreno R..">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a whole different kind of support, Filip. If you look at these FAQ and erratas, they are about printing errors, rules effects not specified in the books, etc.  They are never about "how you play this game", because this common knowledge is assumed (they are played in about the same way, you don't play very differently GURPS or Runequest: you say what your character do, the GM say what happen and what you have to do - rollo dice, try to convince him with role-playing, etc.)<br/><br/>Many indie games break this mold, and they are to be played in very different way from each other.  And this is something that it's very difficult to convey with texts, without knowing the background of the player (is he a long-time roleplayer but used to traditional rpgs? Has he played a lot of indie games already? Is he someone who never played a rpg before?). The interactive forum support, the human contact, is necessary, and its equivalent with "traditional" rpgs isn't the published faq, but the group that first explained you how to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157579/#Comment_157579" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-20T07:41:10+00:00" title="July 20, 2008  7:41AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Except those forum/community posts interact by way of text.<br/><br/>Which is troubling to me; that content should have been in the book.<br/>And if it can be found in threads which people link to, then it can be added to FAQs, some games' sites do this (BW).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157582/#Comment_157582" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-20T08:06:50+00:00" title="July 20, 2008  8:06AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2008 8:07AM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip, feel free to start wiki pages for these things, when you collect them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>*<br/><br/>* Though this reminds me of the sociological issue of the government giving up on helping various groups of people/organizations, and leaving that to the individual people.

Even today, a significant fraction of early fans of every new game published comes from the existing community.  So it became habitual to talk to each other about the game and how to play.  As a result the final published rules are written more like "quick reference guides" where instead of being a quick guide to the main rule book, its a quick guide to the online forums and communications.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's issue is compounded enormously by the large number of games that get published out of the Game Chef or 24 Hour contest paradigm, where the actual text of the game (by function of the nature of the contest) must be in a super abbreviated form.  It works because everyone else following and judging the contest are already "in the know".  But it leads to, IMO, an enormous underestimation of the amount of actual text work required to get those contest rules (little more than notes really) into a legitimate final form.  As a result we see games that are essentially published design notes rather than full fledged rules texts.  I think its a pretty bad trend.  While I admire the game contests for their intense creative output, the contest format is tremendously detrimental to the production of good finished text.  Few games have come out of their contest origins with rules that are up to snuff as finished texts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other is that being amateur hobbiests we don't come from a tradition where people with money invested have a motivation to ensure that the product that gets released is thoroughly edited.  That one's been discussed in depth elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut the two together and what you have is an indie tradition of releasing "quick start guides" and calling them "rule books".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
