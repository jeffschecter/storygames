The various categories of card have been really helpful in producing a game that isn't just win/lose. But I've come to a bit of an impasse and I'm wondering if a fresh perspective might help.<br/><br/>The basic system is based on a target number. You set the stakes, if you equal or beat the number you win, if you don't you lose. So far so standard. But instead of dice we use cards.<br/><br/>The player draws three cards and plays one, adding a stat. The GM draws one card and adds it to the difficulty number. (The cards are revealed simultaneously.) There are some specials:<br/>- An Ace is worth 0 when the GM plays it; if a player plays it it's an auto-fail but the player escapes the consequences of failure.<br/>- A Jack, Queen or King is worth 5 played up front, but can also be played on top of another card to add 5 to it.<br/><br/>After you play, you discard your hand. Periodically the deck is reshuffled.<br/><br/>Also, sometimes a card can trigger additional consequences when played by a player (the "yes/no, but" or "yes/no, and" of this particular system). Specifically, face cards do this; and in the current iteration, any spades card does it too.<br/><br/>Ok, so to the meat of the problem. We were really keen on the idea that the suit of the card represented something about the action being taken. Specifically, you should describe the action you took in accordance with the suit you played:<br/>\u2663\tPower. Overwhelming force, raw intellect, sheer talent, willpower, charm, status.<br/>\u2666\tControl. Finesse, skill, strategy, planning, preparedness, logic, manipulation.<br/>\u2665\tInspiration. Cunning, creativity, dirty tricks, invention, innovation, the unexpected.<br/>\u2660\tSacrifice. Taking risks, taking the hit, sacrificing one thing for another.<br/><br/>The trouble is, you don't know what suit you're going to play until you've played it. And generally, you don't draw any cards until you've decided what you're going to do. We tried asking players to declare what the stakes of their action were, but only describe the *action* after drawing the cards. But that turns out (unsurprisingly) to be really counterintuitive.<br/><br/>One other thing: up until now everyone has had a trump suit based on their prefered MO from the above list. Normally the GM picks any consequences and makes them be stuff the character is going to find unpleasant. But when they play a face card from their trump suit they get to decide the consequences instead.<br/><br/>The thing is, the system works best when you have one suit (spades) that always generates consequences. But that doesn't make any sense unless spades means something special (currently, sacrifice), while other suits mean something else (as above). Similarly, the trump suits are a really cool idea IMO but they don't mean anything unless they're tied to action as described above. The only other way I've thought of to make this work is to say you draw cards in advance - say at the start of every scene - but that has obvious problems, namely that you can deliberately burn through poor cards on actions that don't matter (or at least, that are relatively low-stakes).<br/><br/>I've run out of ideas for how to deal with this. Anyone else got any thoughts?<br/><br/>[*] With Frax and Chrestomancy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386408/#Comment_386408" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-05T12:04:52+00:00" title="August  5, 2012 12:04PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2012 12:06PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard (impossible?) to judge the utility of a game mechanic in a vacuum.

In other words, if I pick Hearts as my Trump suit, I can make a Hearts card mean anything I want, including the normal problem-solving meaning.<br/><br/>An alternate solution we came up with is to find a way to turn cards INTO your Trump suit. Some point system or side reward which allows you to play, say, a Spades card and turn it into a Hearts card. That way, if a player is becoming frustrated at, say, being a manly-man who keeps getting non-action-suit cards, you can invoke/pay/mojo a less desireable card into one of the suit you want.<br/><br/>(One method we had was to simply allow players to pay for this change by lowering the effective rank of the card. For instance, if I want to play a Ten of Spades card as my Trump Suit of Hearts, I have to count it as a 9 of Hearts.)<br/><br/>Actually, I think your suits are throwing you off in more ways than one.<br/><br/>Making each suit represent a category of action/problem-solving causes a whole heck of a lot of problems and doesn't offer the creative parameters you might think.<br/><br/>But more importantly, most stories come down to a choice between temptation and sacrifice, with maybe a third option thrown in if things are supposed to be more exciting than realistic (or you don't want to make your audience think too hard.)<br/><br/>That's why Sacrifice/Spades always seems to be your strongest suit. The push towards sacrifice is an important element of dramatic momentum.<br/><br/>Power, Control and Sacrifice are all methodologies. Sacrifice is a price, a fuel for methodologies.<br/><br/>You might want to think of changing your suits to two kinds of sacrifice (physical/lifeblood vs. hope/mental stablity) and two kinds of temptation (again worldly vs. inner.)<br/><br/>...OR change them all to methodologies/sources of power:<br/>Coercion: Force, Threats, Intimidation, Explosions, Violence<br/>Expertise: Knowledge, Clues, Secrets, Eavesdropping, Experience<br/>Materials: Money, Supplies, Provisions, Jury-Rigging, Scrounging<br/>Influence: Trustworthiness, Charisma, Leadership, Empathy, Family, Tradition<br/><br/>In other words, the cards suits ought to be about EITHER the price you pay OR the way you solve the problem.

I think perhaps the ability to cycle is offset by the GM's ability to set the "failure" condition for any check, meaning you never really want to fail if you can help it. But still a bit concerned, especially if the cards you have are very poor indeed - so that you can tell in advance with certainty that you're going to fail. OTOH that could be fun too, I guess.

It's quite different to our system, and yet there are enough similarities that I may be able to learn something from it.

Indeed, for the application I'm currently thinking of putting it towards (disaster movie game) something similar might work for me.<br/><br/>I think the fact that the cards can be put to different uses depending on the situation is quite helpful in preventing players wanting to just burn through cards, and in making foreknowledge of one's hand a complete drama-killer.<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing - will mull over and see what other lessons I can learn!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386469/#Comment_386469" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T10:17:56+00:00" title="August  6, 2012 10:17AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>From a story telling perspective, I like having a (small) hand of cards to play where the suit is significant.

I'm still worried that, if you don't know the suit in advance, what you draw may turn out to be incompatible with the action you announced, or at the very least an uncomfortable fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386477/#Comment_386477" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T11:25:17+00:00" title="August  6, 2012 11:25AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think when mease says "You say what you want to do", he means only your intent, not your actual action?<br/>"I want to get through the door", not "I punch him and shove my way through the door"<br/>Might be related to IIEE.<br/><br/>- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386483/#Comment_386483" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T12:14:26+00:00" title="August  6, 2012 12:14PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think when mease says "You say what you want to do", he means only your intent, not your actual action?<br/>"I want to get through the door", not "I punch him and shove my way through the door"<br/>Might be related to IIEE.</blockquote>\nSorry, yes - I definitely agree it's possible to separate "intended outcome" from "action taken", but as mentioned in the OP I've found it very hard to get players to take this approach in practice. Saying "I want to get through the door" without saying "...so I kick it down" seems to be very counterintuitive.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386485/#Comment_386485" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T12:51:12+00:00" title="August  6, 2012 12:51PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2012 1:01PM by mease19.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so players draw to tell them if and how they overcome adversity or obstacles or when they take risks.  You want them to engage the drawing mechanism.  What if drawing cards was the way you got experience?  Then players would want to draw cards.  So, you just play with a freeform style.  If you want to throw up an obstacle or situation and offer them a chance to draw great!  "You come to a door and it appears to be locked - do you want to draw?" If they don't want to draw then they don't have a consequence but they have to do something else.  "We don't have much time, lets look for another way instead."  "She's a sly negotiator and we could lose our shirts, let's hire a lawyer."  "It's so big, let's just run away - maybe we can set a trap for it instead."  Even if you don't, players can, at any point, say that they want to draw for it.  "What if the door's trapped, I want a chance to draw!" "She could be trying to trick us, I want to draw to find out!" "It's twice my size, I want to see if I can get the jump on it."  Those who are willing to risk a negative outcome opt in, others opt out (but don't get XP). "The door might be trapped, you try and get in and I'll keep watch." "I've only got a few bucks left, you negotiate but I'm not putting my money on the line." "I'm hurt, you fight and I'll stand back." Those who opt in all get experience, jointly draw three cards, jointly pick one to play, jointly decide on how to narrate their attempt/action, and the GM narrates the outcome.  This way, either the players or GM can identify a moment of adversity, an obstacle, choice point, or a risk, based on the fiction, and call for a draw before anyone takes action (even if it wasn't meant to be one).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386636/#Comment_386636" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-08T08:04:06+00:00" title="August  8, 2012  8:04AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, not sure if I follow you. Are you suggesting as the process<br/><br/>1. Someone identifies something about the current situation which is challenging (a "moment of adversity, an obstacle, choice point or a risk")<br/>2. Everyone present decides whether they wish to engage with the challenge or go do something else<br/>3. Anyone who has decided to engage with the challenge draws cards<br/>4. Now those who drew cards play them and describe their actions (and by the way get XP)<br/><br/>If so, that's a interesting approach. I may give it a shot; I remain concerned that step 1 above will tend to happen after someone has already said what their action will be. "I climb the wall." "Woah, there. Challenge." "Oh, ok. Yeah, I'm in." *draws cards* ... by this point it's already clear what the intended action is, though the cards might conceivably change it.<br/><br/>Maybe the approach is that the GM and/or enthusiastic players need to actively push back on people when they announce a challenge-resolution action before a card draw. Remind said people that they need to identify the obstacle, not the action.<br/><br/>Hmmm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
