Start trying to make those ability checks or rolling for untrained skill usage dependent upon a low Int. You'll feel dumb soon enough.

Charisma is most often my dump stat (because I did enjoy the language and skill bonuses from INT in older editions and wizard was a favorite choice), but I am unhappy if it's below 10.<br/><br/>Paul: I disagree with a couple of things on your list, but it highlights the murkiness of Wisdom and Intelligence. I'd put social cues, gullibility, and intuition solidly in Wisdom. Wisdom was all about common sense (at least that was the description in Red Box D&amp;D, which has stuck with me), and I see that as also intuition, compassion, and self-control (all of which helps with connecting to divine cosmic forces).

"I know how we might all survive here, but I guess I'll just stay silent and let the party die - that'll show everybody how good I am at roleplaying." Obviously this is all dependent on higher-order details about how you play and so on (I'm not trying to naysay Rob or anything), but hike the level of difficulty and stakes high enough, and nobody feels like underplaying themselves. Players manage boundless stupidity and passive plays without any sort of conscious decision to do so often enough that adding any more makes their party seem like a travelling clownery. If players were capable of being <i>too</i> good, then I'd feel the need to down-play for variety and true-to-life characterization, but that's a miracle I've yet to see.<br/><br/>Also, another Ability I use in my D&amp;D homebrew is "Wits". It's sort of the other side of Intelligence: not about education, but about how quickly and accurately your character perceives and thinks. If you'll look at my choice of mental attributes (Wits, Education, Will and Charisma), you'll note that I've specifically selected a set that does not impose limitations upon the ability of the players to make the best choices they can: your character might be uneducated and often miss important details, and he might be slow and hesitate in the face of adversity, but at least in principle he knows just as well as anybody (you, specifically) what should be done in a given situation. He might not have the means to execute your brilliant play, but at least he knows what a stronger person might try. This logic of refuting Intelligence and Wisdom works for me, it is appropriate for the separation of character and player that is inherent to tabletop roleplaying: however much you'd like it, you are not your character, and the basic relationship is most functionally considered a guiding one: you are the guiding intellect and wisdom behind your character's actions. Your character won't listen to his intellect at all times, but you are not the one suffering from fatigue, hunger, injury and fear in a dark dungeon, so your relationship to your character is already irrecovably compromised: it makes no sense for you to try to pretend that you're your character. The best we can do is let you empathize with your character and suggest courses of action to him, and he will execute these to the limits of his abilities and lower urges.<br/><br/>The above is obviously entirely different from an immersive philosophy where we want players to feel that they are their characters. From that viewpoint it might make sense for the players to intentionally put labels on their characters and then strive to play a particularly "wise" or "headstrong" or "smart" character. I just don't think that this works too well, or that it is very interesting in the D&amp;D context: you're problem-solving all the time, adding a need to do the problem-solving with somebody else's brain instead of your own is just too much of a curve-ball. Drop the problem-solving and play it like a drama game, and I can see more sense in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366282/#Comment_366282" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T10:45:46+00:00" title="March  9, 2012 10:45AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2012 10:46AM by Krippler.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look what intelligence does in your edition and simply assume that it's only that kind of intelligence you roll for.

If I wanted to base personality roleplaying on stats, I'd add a real set of personality stats to the game and skip these "wise/unwise" and "intelligent/stupid" dichotomies alltogether. They're not particularly true to life, and they just scratch the surface of what people are like. The D&amp;D stat array is simply not a very high-fidelity tool for doing something like theatrical character portraits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366285/#Comment_366285" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T10:50:29+00:00" title="March  9, 2012 10:50AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>If your game's not about that at all (like, say, it's all about story or exploration or whatnot), then it's fine.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely. I realize that I'm constructing my sentences in an aggressive rhetorical mode here. It's because I enjoy the interpretation of the D&amp;D stat mess I've developed, not because I want to argue everybody else into adapting my own philosophy. I just like telling about what I've realized about the game. There certainly are large numbers of people who take D&amp;D off the shelf when they want to do some funny, relaxed character roleplaying with some sort of fantasy epic background story. I don't get this choice of tools, but to each their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366291/#Comment_366291" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T11:20:57+00:00" title="March  9, 2012 11:20AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>The part I don't get about playing intentionally dumb is that D&amp;D is fucking hard to succeed at without tying one hand behind your back already, so to me it seems like fucking with your party members for no good reason if a player plays dumb.

D&amp;D does make you work for victories, but as written, there's nothing that roleplaying a dumb character should get in the way of when played by someone who understands the importance of roleplaying a character to enhance everyone's fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366293/#Comment_366293" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T11:25:45+00:00" title="March  9, 2012 11:25AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2012 11:28AM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before playing D&amp;D I played a Malkavian from WoD.

The GM went with it,we all had fun and I had a chance to learn the basics. When we played D&amp;D I went for the usual half orc, which was incredibly fun to play. It wasn't about shutting up or taking wrong choices on purpose (hey, do that in any team that depends on you to watch their backs and you'll get kicked in no time, if you don't get killed first!) For me it was about roleplaying a character that wasn't bright, but could still say and do the most innocent and obvious things that could put the other PCs on alert. The rest of the time it was just being funny.<br/><br/>Demigod (speaking in methapors): You're not the "light-bearer", half orc.

I agree with all of the above:<br/><br/>The concept of "Intelligence" in a game which is all about challenging the wits of the players is a very misguided one. So (assuming you're stuck with Intelligence as a statistic), find something else that number says to you, if you need a guide to roleplaying.<br/><br/>It's much more of a flavour or colour thing: much more about *how* you do something than about *whether or not* you choose to do it in the first place.<br/><br/>I'd expect any player to do their best to come up with a solution to a puzzle in this type of game. It's just that the high-Intelligence character will present his or her plan eloquently and logically, whereas the low Intelligence character might have fun speaking in simple words or shrugging and claiming that their intended solution is based on "intuition". \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>It's like Drunken Master: your character is stupid but somehow stumbles ass-backwards into the solutions to challenges all the time. And if you don't, well, blame it on how your PC is stupid and it's just that you're role-playing.</blockquote>\nExactly like that!<br/><br/>My preferred solution would be to get rid of "Intelligence" altogether in this playstyle.

I might be preaching to the choir here, but here's my perspective on this, based on my experience with 2.5E...<br/><br/>It's a great time, (if a little heavy on the paperwork,) simply because all of these dense, obscure mechanics make great things happen at the table once you just accept them as tools, roll with them, and trick yourself into a suspension of disbelief despite the incongruities, metagame hangups and philosophical flaws that come to mind when doing so.  Then again, I've always had a kind of absurdist approach to D&amp;D, and I probably love to gamble with the life, health and sanity of my character more than most people would care to.  I love using the numbers, tables and rules to just make a lot of silly stuff happen.  There is so much info!  So many things to play with that will give your character all the depth you could ever want, if you're just able to cut loose and drift with the gaming table's tide.<br/><br/>To put my blathering into context, I'll relate briefly the story of Grompy, my most recent <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">victim</span> deceased character.  He was a lawful-good ogre-mage shaman (I had this heavy backstory made up for him, explaining how the hell that combo came to pass, but I won't regale you with it now,) with an Intelligence score of 5, and 19 Charisma.  For me, that dichotomy alone said so much about him, and it allowed me to make a really cool, surprisingly deep character that followed a charming and engaging arc towards enlightenment and acceptance... which culminated in him donning a bathtub as a helmet and flying headfirst into a dragon's mouth.  And you know what?  I was fine with that.  He had been wandering in the desert in spirit-animal (flying squirrel) form for a few weeks, had a few epiphanies, and had just found his way back to the party in a way that gave some real closure to the way his moral and social codes had been evolving, and the heroic (Quixotic) moment with the dragon and the bathtub just felt sooo right, because I had this picture of him in my mind's eye that I had constructed over a long period of playing, not <i>in spite of</i> the simplistic, clunky stats, but rather <i>based on</i> their simplistic clunkiness, and how it inspired me.  Long story short, he died a horrible death, spectacularly failing to choke the dragon with a bathtub, and we laughed and cried and ate crisps, in the highest of spirits, while I rolled up a new character.  Grompy's animal companion, Belvedere the Boar, is now my pixie wizard's familiar.<br/><br/>So, my method for the "cerebral stat" hangups, and D&amp;D hangups in general:  Take whatever mechanical meat you can get, make it your own, and perhaps most importantly, <i>share your vision</i> with the group.  Unless your GM is running a meat-and-potatoes, static-character dungeon crawl, or unless you go too far and you're sabotaging the group's story arc with your vision, he or she will probably at least be able to meet you halfway.  It might be hard for the more experienced and cynical gamers to get over the age-old problems like worn-out tropes and anachronisms, blatant mechanical fixes with no in-world justification, etc, but you have to turn a blind eye to these things if you want to maintain the spark of engagement that is the fuel for any game.  Use your built-in "IGNORE"\xa0function, and just play it where it lands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS" title="DavidVS"><img alt="DavidVS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/nMT00GFQS5U2U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">DavidVS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367678/#Comment_367678" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T16:46:32+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  4:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I skipped from AD&amp;D to Pathfinder.
