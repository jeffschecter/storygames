Try not to fret about that too much. You can whisper to me about it if it really irks you.<br/><br/>The reward cycle: your character does stuff and you get some reward which more often than not improves the chance of the character doing that thing again in the future (XP, levels etc in many games), allows you to do other exciting things you couldn't otherwise do (e.g. FATE points), buy off penalties (e.g. Burning Wheel FPs, Warhammer), or chuck more resources at something (FATE, BW etc).<br/><br/>The idea is that by rewarding the player for what their character does you increase engagement in the game. People like rewards and will keep pressing that button to get more of them.<br/><br/>So here's the beef. I'm bored with rewards. I don't play the game to press the button and I strive for engagement without these particular paybacks. I think in our last game of BW, through following my beliefs and instincts, I amassed half the deck of Fate Points but had nothing much on which to spend them. I would have quite happily done these things without the bennie. The belief and instincts are lovely rules setting out freeform constraints on your characters actions making them much more believeable and real in the process.<br/><br/>So my reward is the direct engagement in the game not the secondary effect.<br/><br/>However when you play these games, some players engage with the reward system to a much greater degree and the focus of their game becomes gaming the system rather than engagement in the whatever is happening in the SIS or between the players (don't you love it when you invite another player to really mess with your character and they don't hold back?). To a certain extent, the game turns into Monopoly with added fiction rather than Storytelling under contraints.<br/><br/>How would you balance character improvement and other rewards against avoiding the reward treadmill?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329847/#Comment_329847" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T04:11:07+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  4:11AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2011 4:13AM by Graham.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing is, you've missed out the bit of the definition that's useful.<br/><br/>For example, Fallout is part of the reward cycle of <i>Dogs In The Vineyard</i>.

Virtually every game has one, simply because all previous games have had them. I'd like to see more games that don't embody even part of the zero-to-hero arc.<br/><br/>If you leave that out, there's the idea of requiring mechanical permission to change aspects of your PC, and social rewards. Fan Mail in PTA is a good example of the latter.<br/><br/>Sorry I don't have anything more concrete to say, but I'm not clear exactly what you're asking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329850/#Comment_329850" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T04:37:50+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  4:37AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2011 4:40AM by GB_Steve.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm asking why do you need mechanical reward systems when I think playing the game is reward enough.

The level  rewards draw me toward these changes. In contrast, in Burning Wheel I've often found the reward mini-games uninteresting because they (to me) represent an otherwise untinteresting hurdle of event tracking leading to solely to getting locked into decisions I'm already making. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329857/#Comment_329857" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T05:49:16+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  5:49AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2011 5:52AM by Teataine.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [As usual with forge stuff, the following is purely my understanding, interpretation and conjecture.]<br/><br/>There was this discussion on the Forge a short while back (I can find the link if you want) about reward cycles and what <i>I</i> got away from it was that reward mechanics =/= reward cycle. Stuff like "get XP for this" or "get a bennie when your characacter does X" are reward mechanics, but they're not necessarily the same or even part of the "reward cycle".<br/><br/>As with a lot of Forge jargon, I think "reward cycle" is an unfortunate name for a concept. It refers to "reward" in a very meta, big-picture sort of way, in the sense of "what's rewarding about this?". So when you say "playing the game is reward enough", yeah, that's kinda what this is about (at least the way I understand it).<br/><br/>Here's the thing: when we play, something has to change - either something on my character sheet, or the character or the situation, or the world. In chess, some figures need to get off the board and someone has to win eventually. Imagine chess if you weren't allowed to take other people's figures...you'd just move them arund and nothing would happen - boring! So: change, change is why play itself is rewarding. The <i>largest, longest circle of change that a roleplaying game contains</i>, that's the reward cycle as I understand it.<br/><br/>So in BW, getting Artha for following your beliefs is a reward mechanic, but the reward cycle is when you erase an old, completed Belief and write a new one. That's satisfying, as in, a circle has been completed, a wheel has turned, a cycle has passed, something was accomplished (at the longest time scale). They are related but not equal. Does that make sense to you?<br/><br/>[edit: Also yeah, you can't make people have fun doing something simply by offering rewards. You can bribe them, sure, but giving XP for something won't make people automatically enjoy it.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329860/#Comment_329860" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T06:04:47+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  6:04AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor, could you step away from the rules and jargon a bit more and answer the questions in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>?

Some games give it in quick, small bursts, other games give it as a large climax, some fail to provide it at all (which is a problem). The "it" is creative agenda. Character improvement is only "it" if you're playing a long-term D&amp;D campaign, basically - not a surprise that this is the platonic ideal to such a degree that many roleplayers will play like this even when the game they're playing is neither D&amp;D nor an indefinitely long campaign. It's an inability to shift gears.<br/><br/>As for the actual question, this has been addressed a lot in game design; people have been conflating character improvement with the purpose of play so hard ever since early D&amp;D that it's an entirely real design issue that whatever game you make, it will get played with mixed groups where half of the people are there to play this game while the others are seeing whether the game might provide them with a new flavour of character-buildup exercise, and to hell with what the game text says. To some degree you can't really help this situation with system design, as people will only do things they want to do: many games have been made that don't play the character improvement dreadmill, but if the people you play with are only interested in that one particular kind of game, then those are not relevant to your problem, and you're stuck playing games that do that one thing, and maybe lie about doing something else on the side (trad design has a lot of this, Whitewolf style: make claims about being about something else while providing the treadmill to keep the actual rpg gamer demographic happy).<br/><br/>If I absolutely had to play with CA-blind gamers who are stuck on character development, I would probably play their game and make the best of it. You can't redirect people with clever rules tricks, they need to want it to get something different. If the players are theoretically willing to try something else, then playing <i>Polaris</i> or <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> might be worth a try: both of those games completely deconstruct the character development treadmill to such a degree that you can still hear the gnashing teeth of gamers who can't accept that at the end of either game your character is going to be removed from the game exactly because you were so good with building up that experience load. I've seen this experience miss the point completely on some more blinkered players, but with others it helps them broaden their horizons, so maybe, maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329870/#Comment_329870" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T07:12:02+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  7:12AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, as everyone's saying, you totally don't need character improvement or beanies.

What will attract players to it?<br/>2) How does it deliver to the players something that they are looking for? (This is your reward).<br/>3) Does that reward get stale over time or from overuse?

I've been trying to get a D&amp;D game going where all the rewards would be in-fiction. No XP, no level-up, no feats...if you want your character to "advance" you need to earn it in game. So I'm with you there, I think.<br/><br/>Still, I find that mechanical rewards have their uses. <br/>-One is communicating what the game is about, simple enough. D&amp;D post 3E is about killing monsters. Burning Wheel is about fighting for your beliefs. Etc. I find it useful to have it as an orientation.<br/><br/>-Another advantage of mechanical (aka real world) rewards over just in-fiction ones is that they're tangible, palpable. People get excited about getting stuff! As I said, you can't simply make people enjoy something by rewarding them for it, but getting rewards is not completely without its pavlovian effects. When you overcome a challenge for example, it's nice to have something to show off for it! When I kill that dragon, maybe I just killed a dragon. But it's somehow cooler if I can write "Dragonkiller" on my sheet or make a armour out of his scales that gives me +10 to AC instead of just +8.<br/><br/>-Some people just enjoy the mechanical optimization bits. Getting mechanical rewards is part of that. It's never my primary focus but I do understand the appeal. Playing to-&gt; get enough experience to-&gt; level up to -&gt;get that feat to -&gt;unlock the prerequisites for that prestige class to -&gt; be able to shoot two arrows at once is certainly something that can be a motivation when you sit down at the table.<br/><br/>Does that answer your question?<br/><br/>I guess it's a playstyle thing. I'm perfectly comfy on either side. I'm currently playing in a Pathfinder game that's very much about getting lootz and XP but I'm also facilitation a structured freeform game where any notion of "mechanical rewards" would be absurd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329897/#Comment_329897" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T08:46:38+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  8:46AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everytime I play Dogs I get into social situations that I can not when.

Namely, I think that game mechanics are consistently misinterpreted due to the historical bias discussed above: anything that looks even vaguely like D&amp;D will get interpreted as D&amp;D at all levels, all the time. To get any sort of sense of the matter one simply has to distinguish entirely between character and player, and between D&amp;D and the general idea of rewarding roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Talking of Keys in <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, they are not a reward mechanism in any sense except perhaps that players will often instinctually approach collecting xp as a reward because that's how they're wired from prior experience. The actual purpose for having Keys and experience points in the game is that they're an elaborate flagging system (for the player himself, other players and the Story Guide) and a gauge for dramatic pacing, respectively. I do not deny that many people will instinctively find collecting XP fun, but that's an incidental effect of prior experience, one that is perhaps utilized by the design in introducing the game (TSoY is often cited as a "lure" you can use to introduce dramatic narrativism to traditional gamers), but not in any way central to actually enjoying it long-term: insofar as TSoY as a system is concerned, you collect and spend experience points according to how fast you want to pace the game, and according to which facets of the fiction you want to highlight. Gaining xp poses no challenge whatsoever in this game, and rarely will a player who fully grogs the system be particularly excited about scoring yet another Advance; he's interested in why that Advance was gained and what it was spent on, but merely having more of them means extremely little to him. It is not uncommon for an experienced player to actually gain experience points slower as he realizes that the true benefit of claiming the points is in highlighting the events of the game rather than in getting as many as you can; activating your Keys lightly will simply mean that the act loses its significance.<br/><br/>(Were the above not true I would personally have no means of distinguishing TSoY from D&amp;D aside from incidental matters of mechanical aesthetics. There would be no moral difference between TSoY and a game like <i>Vampire</i>, say, with its lofty dramatic claims.)<br/><br/>If I had to name a "reward mechanic" (itself as suspect concept when understood as a mechanic that rewards the player; presumably all mechanics do, for why have them otherwise) as such in TSoY, I would probably point at the Transcendence mechanic as a pretty easily isolated, one-time spotlight reward. It's mechanical in that the game flat out goes into a Transcendence when you arrive at a given game-state, and it's rewarding because it enforces a definite end to the individual character's story while allowing the player the authority to resolve the currently remaining issues in a manner that relaxes all dramatic tension at once. Aside from that most reward cycles of the game involve complex interactions of the Pool mechanics, crunch and judicious use of scene framing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329931/#Comment_329931" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T10:22:33+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 10:22AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>GBSteve, you don't.

You get gold, which gets you XP, which increases your level, which gets you access to some stuff that, for the longest time, made me go, "Huh? What's this junk about building and maintaining castles and shit? I thought this was about dungeons."<br/><br/>Gradually I realized that the castles and retainers and everything were a scoring mechanism. You gain this stuff by playing well, and it's evidence of how well you played. Furthermore, it's <i>customizable</i> -- the real reward isn't getting castle stuff, but getting <i>options to build your castle, your way</i>. You get to make a mark on the gameworld in your own image (and apparently segue into large-scale minis battles, but I'm not sure how often that actually happened).

I like that, as long as I am there to play that game for that reason.<br/><br/>In many games, there is no clear target for such a feedback loop to point at, or the feedback does not actually point at what it is supposed to, or I am not actually interested in the game for the reasons it was designed around. In those cases, the same design feature is a hindrance.<br/><br/>I do not use any of the feedback mechanics in a consistent way in D&amp;D most of the time when I run it. I am much more interested in social and in-fiction rewards, so I just issue character improvements when it's time to move on to new content or when players are getting bored with their current suite of mechanical options.<br/><br/>I find the feedback mechanics in many mainstream RPGs detrimental to the stated intent of the game - "leveling up" and gaining new toys actually undermines the kinds of fictional content that something like Vampire wants to deliver. I don't play those games much any more, because they work at cross-purposes to themselves and if I'm going to have to ignore that much of the mechanics, I'll just hack FATE or something to play it.<br/><br/>I love games that have clear signaling, like Dogs in the Vineyard, but I only play them when I want exactly what they're selling - I don't even like to hack them, generally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330284/#Comment_330284" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T15:04:00+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  3:04PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>GBSteve, you don't.

I think they're a deep unexamined assumption, even among storygamers.<br/><br/>I grew up in part on Traveller. It had, famously, no advancement rules (not strictly true actually, they were in book two, but they were minimal and we didn't use them much). It didn't impede play at all.<br/><br/>Similarly when I've run or played Over the Edge I've never seen the XP rules used. Probably because they're not very good (in an otherwise great game). Frankly, advancement in that system never made much sense to me.<br/><br/>For me reward mechanics get in the way of the core of what I enjoy in rpgs. They particularly do so because I'm no more immune to Skinnerian response cycles than anyone else. When I play D&amp;D I start thinking about xp. I can't help it. I'd rather though be thinking about how Lentule Fusc is going to escape the pursuing villagers who wish to string him up after an unfortunate incident involving a flying ship, a misunderstanding regarding the controls and the perhaps regrettable fate of the local orphanage (though I do note they were at least spared a likely life of poverty and disappointment).<br/><br/>XP for me is a bit like a tv in a pub. When it's there I can't help pay attention to it. My eyes are drawn by the movement. Part of why I dislike tvs in pubs is precisely because I end up watching them. Pubs are better without tvs. RPGs would be better if they only had reward mechanics where there was some good game-specific reason for including them. Instead of that they're in almost everything because they were in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Feel free to ask questions, challenge, etc. [Edit: That's a general feel free, not Steve specific.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330396/#Comment_330396" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T07:01:56+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  7:01AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few thoughts.<br/><br/>Human psychology likes "bennies" (rewards of some sort even if it's really completely abstract) - also being attracted to it (like the TV in pub as noted above).  <br/><br/>Part of "game design" is tapping into the psychology of fun.  That said, fun comes from other sources too so "bennies" are not essential and easily become an area where games break.  Mechanically it's hard enough to design something that works, then design how it keeps working with continual marginal adjustments.  Systems what give "non-permanent" currency (fate points etc.) are easier to avoid designing to not break than those that give "accruing adjustments" (character advancement).  <br/><br/>Having said all that, I've been having some fun recently with <i>Cthulhu Dark</i> which has no "reward system" as such, which leads to next point.  I think "reward" is one type of "change".  One of the roles that "change" has is to "keep things fresh".   Whether across different stories or within a session, your health/sanity shift and that changes situation for you.  You Insanity die value being 4 now is a change from the 1 it started at.  <i>In a Wicked Age</i> has a basic advancement system but really doesn't need it to be fun, just the ability to shift dice around between sessions reflecting "changes in character" is enough.<br/><br/>The other game I'm mostly playing now is <i>Warhammer 3rd Edition </i>and with proper player mentality, a Critical Wound or Insanity is fun - because they change the character and the situation for them (it does have a reward-advancement system and actually that in long run is the greatest threat to long run enjoyment of same character, to go back to my point in paragraph above).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330397/#Comment_330397" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T07:02:42+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  7:02AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Pub TV is a great analogy and probably why I've not seen Solar System work in the way Eero describes it.

What your comment sparked in me though was I'd be happy to see advancement abandoned, but I'd also be happy to see more change mechanics.<br/><br/>In life and in fiction most people/characters don't really advance in a D&amp;D sense. They do, however, change. Sometimes a story is about how and whether a person changes, and when they do or don't that's their story over. Sometimes a story involves a fairly steady state character. Their situation changes but they don't. And some characters, and real people hopefully, change throughout their lives.<br/><br/>None of that necessitates advancement. None of that in fact is about rewards. The right to change your character isn't about being rewarded for being a good little player, it's about organic change within the fiction. <br/><br/>Another point that came to me out of your post was something I experienced playing Swords and Wizardry. I enjoyed low level play. I enjoyed trying to level up and in that game would have missed it. Once we'd made a few levels though it wasn't really the same game anymore. That feeling of danger at the early levels was much reduced. Advancement changed not just the characters, but the nature of the game. That I think is not necessarily a good thing.<br/><br/>I would like to see game designs actually thinking about whether characters should change (in some genres the answer is probably no, supers for example in most cases and possibly crime procedurals), whether they should be subject to change (anything primarily focused on relationship/character based drama) and whether they should have advancement (very few stories I would argue - basically just quest and zero to hero ones, and maybe bildungsroman).<br/><br/>Instead almost every game defaults to advancement. It's sloppy. It's limiting the form. I know open ended play isn't the ideal here it is elsewhere, but what I'd like to see is more games thinking about how to support open ended or long term play in the absence of advancement. Traveller managed it in the 1970s. Since then hardly anyone else has even tried.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330402/#Comment_330402" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T07:40:19+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  7:40AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Steve,<br/><br/>Could you clarify what you're looking for?<br/><br/>Do you want to talk about Reward Cycles as the are ACTUALLY defined in the Big Model Theory which is what Eero is talking about?<br/><br/>Or do you only want to talk about bennies for "good behavior"?<br/><br/>Jesse</blockquote>\nSteve, it would be quite helpful with this clarification, actually.

You get gold, which gets you XP, which increases your level, which gets you access to some stuff that, for the longest time, made me go, "Huh? What's this junk about building and maintaining castles and shit? I thought this was about dungeons."<br/><br/>Gradually I realized that the castles and retainers and everything were a scoring mechanism. You gain this stuff by playing well, and it's evidence of how well you played. Furthermore, it's<i>customizable</i>-- the real reward isn't getting castle stuff, but getting<i>options to build your castle, your way</i>. You get to make a mark on the gameworld in your own image (and apparently segue into large-scale minis battles, but I'm not sure how often that actually happened). And you decide your goals on your own and struggle with the game to make them happen, which is always cool.<br/><br/>Then I realized that AD&amp;D3 was the same thing. Except, instead of options for a castle or whatever, you get more options to design your character.</blockquote>\nIt is kind of important to remember that in a lot of ways, OD&amp;D was a bit of a culmination of trends and experiments in the miniatures wargaming hobby that pre-dated D&amp;D. In this it parallels the way Vampire The Masquerade was a product of converging trends in the RPG hobby through the 1980s, post <i>D&amp;D as Fad Success </i>at the turn of the 1970s/early 1980s.<br/><br/>Marshall, in my experience, those big minis battles probably did not end up happening very often, at least not for folks who came into the hobby as kids during the Fad Success period (what Dave "grubman" Bezio named the Boxed Set Generation. People like me, for example). I strongly suspect those rules and that particular play arc was designed for the slightly earlier gamer generation that bridged the older minis gamer generation of the 1960s and the initial RPG as Type of Minis Wargame Generation of the initial D&amp;D release period. <br/><br/>In other words, the crossover generation that included the designers of D&amp;D and early RPGs, who were also the recipients of  the theorizing/philosophizing/experimenting of the 1960s Minis Gamer Generation and vanguard thinkers who were going even farther with some of the more niche concepts proposed by those Old Guard Minis Guys.<br/><br/>I actually had a lengthier post written on the history of all that stuff. I'll just sum it up. Those kinds of improvement mechanics, first for armies and kingdoms and later for individual heroes, made sense in that early context (and still do in games played in the present day with similar intents).<br/><br/>The current day context of most RPGs and the goals in playing them, however, are vastly different. I doubt, for eample, that those older generations of grognards would have ever conceptualized open-ended powering up as in D&amp;D as it developed over time. Or even open-ended, continual play for that matter, since in the old gamer context, campaigns were meant to end at some point. If they didn't, how could you tell who'd won???<br/><br/>Getting back to the original topic, however, I'd hazard that all rewards and reward cycles are essentially about creating incentives to continue to meet and play.<br/><br/>At the core of that, the reward is Social Recognition. The other stuff, the bennies and whatever else are attempts to create some kind of marker for that social recognition that also encourages return play.<br/><br/>If I'm on the right track with that bit, even a little, it might be worth starting from that perspective and naming off stuff that provides social recognition, without being goofy or embarassing for the participants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330456/#Comment_330456" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T12:12:21+00:00" title="June 17, 2011 12:12PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>Valvorik,<br/><br/>Apologies if I've missed part of your point, I'm a little tired today.

I like a game where a character as expressed mechanically can change.  Stories that are interesting to me are ultimately about change in characters, for good or ill or just change, or at least change is risked (will you go back to drinking too much or not).  <br/><br/>I need "change" in a system, I can take or leave advancement.  The fact that a <i>D&amp;D</i> character can "advance" 20 times but not really "change" as a character bores me, that an <i>In a Wicked Age </i>character can go from all For Myself to now For Others - cool!  Even in <i>Warhammer 3rd Edition</i>, I'm emphasizing that the "advancement" really is "change".  You take a cool talent that adds to stealth, but it's called Sneaky - ah so you're a sneaky sort are you?  That you're good at sneaking is less interesting to me than that you are sneaky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330539/#Comment_330539" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T21:39:29+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  9:39PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, one way I'm like you is that I don't need rewards in order to be "forced" to roleplay my character as if they were somewhat like a real person.  I've always done that, instinctually, since my mid-teens.<br/><br/>But in the years before I played S-G (and even occasionally since then when I've ventured into trad games), I found that habit nearly always worked out extremely poorly for me.  If my characters had morals or hard lines they wouldn't cross, if they were willing to do things that were mechanically sub-optimal but morally correct, I just got fucked, both in-game and socially.  It was viewed as disruptive.  <br/><br/>Now, one way to deal with that phenomenon is simply to completely reorganize play around other issues.  This can lead to some great experiences like some of the Jeepform or PTA that I've played.  In those games, I was rewarded (socially and by the experience of play) for simply acting like a real person with morals and doubts and all that.  <br/><br/>But I don't want to be restricted to those kinds of games\u2014I think by getting rid of more traditional mechanics entirely, I think you lose the ability to have <i>adventure fiction-based</i> gaming, which is something many gamers want (including me, though not all the time).  Because adventure fiction revolves around things like fights, perilous journeys, and fraught, conflict-y social interactions, you need to have game mechanics that support those sorts of interactions.  And it only makes sense for the characters' ability to interact with those mechanics to change (not necessarily only improve, either\u2014see the Sickness and Injury rules in Mouse Guard).<br/><br/>Burning Wheel (and a few other games) are really ideal, then, for someone like me because it's an adventure fiction game where something like a character's moral limits are nevertheless a valid priority of play because there are ways of communicating about those things without it disrupting the game.  <br/><br/>Are Beliefs and Instincts and Fate and Persona points <i>necessary</i> to making sure we can deal with moral issues in the game without coming to blows or at best serious misunderstandings out of game?  Well, maybe not.  But it sure helps, and it specifically helps games that want to be adventure fiction games that still have morality on the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390380/#Comment_390380" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T00:08:39+00:00" title="September 16, 2012 12:08AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me mechanical rewards are usually game-breakers.

It's something players can look down at their sheet and say "wait, I've only accumulated 1 xp, and Cordelia just took an advance... maybe I should push a little."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390420/#Comment_390420" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T10:46:24+00:00" title="September 16, 2012 10:46AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me playing is reward by itself, and I'm one of those masochistic players that really can losing as well.<br/><br/>But one level of reward that is important to me is that I get confirmation from the other players that they are enjoying and like my contribution.

It doesn't have to be e moment to moment thing, and most often you can read from the interaction if people enjoy playing with you. (Even if enjoying might at the moment mean crying or cursing you or looking at you with disdain.)<br/><br/>Yet I think this is important part of reward cycles many times.

An interesting side I'm learning about is Self-Determination Theory as given particularly by Ed Deci and Richard Ryan.  <br/><br/>They find broad support for the idea that reward mechanics can sometimes de-motivate behaviors that are intrinsically rewarding.  For example, in an experiment with kids drawing - many children would draw for fun given crayons or markers and paper.  However, experiments found that after a period of being given rewards for drawing (even as simple as verbal praise), kids would draw less when those rewards were stopped.  The course I'm taking recommended two books on the subject: Daniel H. Pink, "Drive - The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us" and Scott Rigby and Richard Ryan, "Glued to Games".  <br/><br/>According to my class (I haven't read the books yet), reward mechanics can be less demotivating if they are intangible,  unexpected, and/or come across as data on the performance rather than reward for the performance.  I'm still pondering if this has implications for RPG design.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Do you need a reward cycle? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14487/do-you-need-a-reward-cycle/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Do you need a reward cycle? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14487/do-you-need-a-reward-cycle/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Generally speaking, no.

The main joy I get from roleplaying, as opposed to other tabletop gaming (which I also do a great deal of, like most here), is the joy of improvising unexpected fiction and responding to others' improvisations. Not surprisingly, I have actually come in the last couple of years to prefer one-shot games (Fiasco, Lady Blackbird style mini-games/game playsets, etc.), parlor-ish games (Baron Munchausen), and rules-light games (Cthulhu Dark, etc.). My joy is, I guess, in the improvisation and jazz-like collaboration of story creation. I love introducing twists and complications into play (Making Offers, you know) and responding to others'. Reflection tells me that the reward from this behavior is mostly social and aesthetic, not mechanical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390522/#Comment_390522" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T07:12:13+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  7:12AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like how some reward systems and reward cycles can add an interesting dynamic to a game that would not otherwise exist.

And you can change them! So you decide who you are and how you want to play.<br/><br/>You\u2019re not rewarded for how your character behaves. You\u2019re rewarded for how you... the player... communicates. It\u2019s a feedback system.<br/><br/>The game's resolution system is rigged against you. It's very difficult to succeed without consequences by yourself. You need help (reinforcing this is a co-op team based game first, not a solo exercise) and often you need the benefits you get from the game's Reward system.<br/><br/>So if you are failing a lot, it's often a clear sign something is wrong.<br/><br/>If at the end of the Player's Turn, you don't receive any rewards for your Beliefs &amp; Goals (and other considerations) something is wrong.<br/><br/>The Reward System makes these issues transparent and encourages communication between players.<br/><br/>Players can then change their Beliefs &amp; Goals or the GM can work around the existing player priorities. Either way, there are clear indicators to set and measure expectations.

For myself, I do enjoy engaging with the reward systems in RPGs, but it's certainly not the only things which I find rewarding as I'll do things which aren't rewarded.  I do, however, like the interesting reward systems.  For example, Burning Wheel's Artha system, as others have mentioned focuses attention on your character's beliefs, instincts, and traits and basically, who they are.  I try to always think about that in a game, but I feel that BW has really led me to focus on it more than I would have in other systems.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World (which I still haven't had the opportunity to play) has a pattern of mechanics like Seduce/Manipulate where if you do what you are being manipulated to do, you mark XP.  As I said, I haven't played it, but I think I like it.  I think it's a lot easier for me (and many of the people I play with) to get behind something like that wholeheartedly when the game encourages it like that.  In other words, at least in the cases where the game uses the rewards to encourage certain things and I like those things, I think they work great for me and the people I play with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390683/#Comment_390683" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T11:00:40+00:00" title="September 18, 2012 11:00AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know this is sumarizing what everyone else is saying, but: <br/><br/>I don't think it's a matter of NEEDING a rewards cycle as much as being aware that all games offer a rewards cycle and modifying your rules to take advantage of that.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is fairly obvious about what it THINKS is its rewards cycle and has always been a bit confused about its real rewards cycle, for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390695/#Comment_390695" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T12:08:36+00:00" title="September 18, 2012 12:08PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seconding Frank T wrt Refreshment in Shadow of Yesterday; it was the part of play experience that re-oriented my thinking about the reward cycle, from 'get xp/bennies (etc)' to 'what part(s) of the system trigger/encourage/engage the part of play I want in this game, and how.'

I think of it as meaning, "a cycle of play that is rewarding." Follow that?<br/><br/>I mean, if your play is clearly rewarding, then there was probably some kind of reward cycle there. You did something and interacted with the system somehow and as a result your play was clearly rewarding, generally in the form of feedback from /the other players/, not from the mechanics. The mechanics might also give you some kind of perk, but it's way more meaningful when the other players recognize the value of that perk. "Oh, dude, you leveled up to 5th? You can cast fireball now. Awesome." "You changed your trait to a fear of horses? That's pretty cool." "Roger the Merciless has been trying to master the Necromantic Black Arts for ages now; it's about time he finally learned to summon dark angels."<br/><br/>If your play is rewarding, I'll bet there's a reward cycle there. Maybe we're talking about different things. Maybe you just mean systems with regular bennies for a job well done, and you're saying that you don't need your character to change mechanically for your play to be rewarding. That's fine--whatever. But it's the system (but perhaps not mechanics) that also lets you change your character in the fiction--positionally and whatnot: theme, story, characterization, etc.--and I suspect those are part of your reward cycle. That is, your reward cycle is: 1. play, 2. you make story happen, 3. you change your character in interesting ways (fictionally but perhaps not mechanically), 4. repeat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390786/#Comment_390786" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T08:36:44+00:00" title="September 19, 2012  8:36AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2012 8:40AM by Rickard.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny thing, that about rewards, and how people in general, in my experience, tend to think that rewards are just about improving the character.

There was one experiment (of many in this certain area of how rewards affect people) with children where they were supposed to draw paintings. They said to one group that they were given a reward in form of a poster if they finished a painting, but didn't tell the second group anything. What happened? The group that didn't get a reward did more drawings. (I'm telling from my mind, so bare with me if it's not 100 % accurate.)<br/><br/>So what does this example show when it comes to attract players into acting in a certain pattern with XP? It takes the fun of it. They do it for the reward rather than <i>wanting</i> to do it.<br/><br/>There are several kind of rewards. <b>Mechanical ones</b>, like XP and gear, are just one of them.<br/><br/><b>In-game rewards</b>, like getting improved status, building relations or getting information by actually doing something. I don't mean improving your status trait or roll against Library Use to get information. No, I mean that the GM is telling the players through the rewards that they are on the right track. "Cool, you went to the library. Here are the information you got". "It was nice of you to buy rounds on the tavern. It gives you some new friends for the evening and you talk about the adventures that you've been in". It's actually quiet like mechanical rewards, but more bound to what actually happens in the world.<br/><br/><b>Appreciation rewards</b> are really easy to implement and I'm surprised that it's not a general rule in all roleplaying games. It's were you acknowledge something the other players done. It can be as simple as saying "Cool, you ..." or "It was nice of you ...". When I took a course to be a soccer trainer for children, the teacher told the class that he had a goal to give every player in the team a compliment every session. That's a guideline that I tend to follow as a game master as well, and after a while, you do it without thinking of it. You laugh with the players, you acknowledge them by words or the best thing of all rewards: you make sure that whatever they made up, what ever action they did, it matters. If they invent a cousin on the spot, use that cousin. If they hatch a scheme, let them succeed, but with a possible twist. Then the game becomes fun in itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone" title="Dr_Stone"><img alt="Dr_Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone">Dr_Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390828/#Comment_390828" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T16:03:14+00:00" title="September 19, 2012  4:03PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the experiment with drawing kids:<br/><br/>There are clearly examples of games where points and rewards encourage play (at least in people who play those games).

I'm currently playing a CCG flash game called Tyrant and the reward is all about getting gp to buy new cards so I can improve my deck. And I need to improve my deck to finish the missions. There the reward works, and it also works in games such as D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I think the problem starts when you use the mechanical rewards on other areas in RPGs, like acting out as your characters, describing how you attack someone in a really cool way, following your belief etc. There is were the trouble start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390854/#Comment_390854" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T00:34:30+00:00" title="September 20, 2012 12:34AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2012 10:50AM by Rob_Alexander.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There was one experiment (of many in this certain area of how rewards affect people) with children where they were supposed to draw paintings.

They say: \n<blockquote>The research facts are clear. Decrease of motivation following reward only occurs when the reward is solely for engagement in the task; when reward is made contingent on task completion or on some performance standard, motivation does not decrease. And performance improves. </blockquote>\nThey attribute the spread of the "rewards reduce motivation" meme to Alfie Kohn's book "Punished by Rewards" (which they're quite dismissive of - "...primarily polemical, and not competently scientific...").<br/><br/>Watson and Tharp's book is excellent primer on behaviour change, BTW, although quite heavy going.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390855/#Comment_390855" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T00:51:46+00:00" title="September 20, 2012 12:51AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2012 12:55AM by Rob_Alexander.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark W said:\n<blockquote>The term "reward" system is a bit misleading.

Beliefs are flags as a much as anything, allowing players to say what they want the story to be about; if they're not hitting them then that story, at least, isn't developing. The act of checking whether you're due Artha for hitting Beliefs (e.g. at the end of a session) becomes an act of checking whether each player's flagged story aspects are advancing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14487/do-you-need-a-reward-cycle" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14487/do-you-need-a-reward-cycle" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14487/do-you-need-a-reward-cycle/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14487%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14487%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
