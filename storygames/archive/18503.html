I have one player who defies my hate no matter what game we're playing, and it makes me seethe occasionally. In a friendly way, not a terrible dysfunctional way. Freemarket is the one, single case where I really wish I had a digital, form-fillable User Profile sheet and MRCZ sheet, for a couple reasons. Limited number on the pad, the significant adjusting of what's written with burning/gifting/getting memories, and it would be just wonderfully thematic in a way I can't see it being for any other game, transhuman or no. So, I've looked on the googles and turned up nothing with my limited ability to do so, and thus I turn to my community. Anyone know where I can find form-fillable sheets for Freemarket? Cheers, all!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416505/#Comment_416505" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T14:46:54+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  2:46PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't exist, as far as I know. To be honest, what with all of the erasing and writing you do in that game session-to-session, I would think a form-fillable sheet would be more of a hindrance--you have to go back to it after each session and then change things according to your notes and print another one out. Or do you mean that everyone would be playing with digital sheets at the table, on tablets or something? I suppose that would work, if everyone had the tech and that wasn't against group etiquette.<br/><br/>Still and all, maybe there's a reason that there isn't a form-fillable sheet, even for such a game (*especially* for such a game?). Sure, it's a super-advanced, high tech society, but we're modeling it in the most low-tech way possible. Intentional? I dunno (and who cares about intent of the artist?), but I think it works on a number of levels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416514/#Comment_416514" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T15:41:40+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  3:41PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had indeed meant for sheets to be utilized on laptops, netbooks or tablets.
