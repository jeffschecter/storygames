                    So, instead of necessarily offering predictions and arguing about the multiple directions in which indie roleplaying is heading (and I'm speaking mostly about the social community that surrounds it less than the actual games themselves), I thought it might be beneficial to start by offering brief visions of possible futures.  These can be apocalyptic or utopian or any mixture in between.  They could be warnings of possible dangers or signposts pointed in interesting directions.  And you don't necessarily have to say which yours is, because one person's apocalypse might be another's utopia.  I'll start:<br/><br/><b>INDIE ROLEPLAYING MIGHT BECOME...</b><br/><br/><b>...something you do mostly with other indie game designers and enthusiasts.</b> Large urban communities and some rural enclaves (like the folks out in Western Mass) have groups of indie game designers, other indie folks, and their friends, spouses, children, bf/gf, etc. At least a couple people in the group try to keep up with what's being published and talked about and the group tries to play a diversity of neat indie games, partially because they like playing them, partially because they inspire their own designs, and partially because they are friends (online, in person, etc.) with the designers who created them.  Sometimes game designers or indie games fans from other communities will pass through or move into town, so there is some intermixing (and there's always big hoedowns at regional or national conventions), but mostly you just play with other local indie games people.  Indie roleplaying remains a small and somewhat independent subcommunity of roleplaying in general.                </div>

<p>I find it interesting that indie gamers seem to like playing (and collecting) <em>lots</em> of different indie games, whereas mainstream gamers seem to latch onto one product line (D&amp;D, White Wolf, Exalted, ..). You wouldn't go to an indie game "hoedown" and expect to see everyone playing the same game. Indie games are cheaper and mostly standalone and mainstream games have huge (and expensive) product lines. Once you have an investment in a particular mainstream game, then disincentive to try other games grows.</p>
<p>This sounds like that earlier thread about crossover games, but indie games could probably learn from boardgames, which are standalone games but don't have the same stigma as RPGs.</p>

<b>...a grassroots revolution.</b> Indie games are viral: demo them, play them, and you become infected. Your only recourse is to pass on the infection. Slowly, bit by bit, players are introduced to new (not really) and different ways to play roleplaying games. <em>ZOMG! Players can narrate! You don't need a GM! Losing can be cool! You can resolve conflicts rather than tasks!</em> The games themselves aren't bestsellers and are never marketed as such, but they have a cache all their own. People rethink their expectations of traditional RPGs. Generic systems wane, house rules and games designed for a specific purpose increase.                        </div>

                            *...A different baseline.*  The basic concept of "build your own game" could spread until it becomes seen by many as where 'casual players' turn into 'hardcore gamers'.  Collective projects, shared content, and the like could make this easier and easier, until the number of games out there goes from merely astonishing to utterly staggering, and many people "network" by picking up and reading each others' games.<br/><br/>(I think of this one as an outside chance, but a fun one hypothetically).                        </div>

                            Levi, your view leads to me to think about something that may be a problem: too many games! I feel inundated with awesome, in terms of the selection of good indie games right now, and everyone seems to be creating more all the time. Sure, some of them are more like party games or an evening's distraction rather than a long-form RPG, but man! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Posted By: Chris PetersonI find it interesting that indie gamers seem to like playing (and collecting)lotsof different indie games, whereas mainstream gamers seem to latch onto one product line (D&amp;D, White Wolf, Exalted, ..). You wouldn't go to an indie game "hoedown" and expect to see everyone playing the same game. Indie games are cheaper and mostly standalone and mainstream games have huge (and expensive) product lines. Once you have an investment in a particular mainstream game, then disincentive to try other games grows.<br/>
<br/>
I have a tiny hypothesis that in any given 12 months, the average Exalted/D&amp;D player and the average indie gamer learn and use the same quantity of rules - it's just that for the indie gamer, it's spread over twelve games and the entire year, whereas for the other guy it's frontloaded.<br/>
<br/>
It's a weak hypothesis because the average indie gamer probably plays a fair bit of crunchier, front-loaded systems (like Burning Wheel, but D&amp;D/Exalted/Whatever too), and the fact that the games are "indie" is irrelevant compared to their sheer focus, but there you go.                        </div>

Is that right?  I don't think brand loyalty in the trad scene is quite as rigid as that, some people stick with one game line but many trad groups play a ton of different games.  I was recently looking at getting some new players and looked at ads and so on in my FLGS and online, and the vast majority of people talked about a range of trad games they played, relatively few had only one loyalty.<br/><br/>Anyway, my own hypothesis:<br/><br/>The indie thing will get coopted in part into the mainstream, trad games will pick up some of the cooler ideas, some indie designers will become part of the establishment.  The homebrew ethos will flourish but then die off a bit with a greater emphasis on playing what you're given taking shape.  Some years later someone will get tired of that and we will have a new homebrew philosophy shaping up and pushing against the then consensus.<br/><br/>In other words, I think this is a necessary reinvigoration of the hobby, I think it has happened before and I think it will happen again.  I see it as entirely a good thing, and particularly as a good thing for shaking up trad games which I love and which need a good shakeup from time to time.                        </div>

                            So, Max, as the Who would say:<br/><br/>Meet the new boss, the same as the old boss.<br/><br/>Jonathan, at GenCon this year, on the three occasions I came by the booth, each time I would look at the demo tables, and counted far, far too many designers and such at the tables. I mean an occasional ringer is a good idea. But I'd often see whole tables of designers playing. Sure, designers buy each other's stuff, too, and you want to get the other people at the booth to learn the games so they can demo them as well. But there's a point at which there's a horizon where you're doing more internal exchange than external. <br/><br/>While up at the Games on Demand, we had a lot of new players. Yeah, we had lots of the designer types as well. But the point is that we had plenty of room for more designer types who might have wanted to play. <br/><br/>What I'm suggesting is that, next year, try to stay away from demoing at the booth. Go to GoD, or just to some open gaming area, and play there. With other designers, if you want, or with new people, whatever. The point is to leave the demo tables a bit more open for new people to play. Else it is possible that "indie" games become just those games played by us folks. <br/><br/>Of course, that assumes that you feel that the vision of it becoming insular is bad. And, that said, I think that even at the current rate of exposure at the Forge booth and elsewhere, that indie games are still growing in terms of people playing them. So I think that your prediction is unlikely in the end. I think that Max has the right of it, that "independents" come and go in cycles. Like "alternative" music, which quickly became the new pop music. The revolution succeeds, the revolutionaries become the establishment, and then new revolutionaries arise. It's a natural cycle. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            The other thing is, I think the impact of indie games is partly in people getting into those games, but more is trad designers picking them up and nicking bits.<br/><br/>Two concrete examples.  I once had a drink with one of the designers of the d20 Conan game, which has concepts in it apparently which were directly inspired by his reading of Sorceror &amp; Sword.  Similarly, Allen Varney is on record as saying that elements of the new Paranoia rpg draw on ideas he took from My Life with Master.<br/><br/>That is real impact, those are big games, that is the indie thing working and changing how people game, people who have never heard of a single indie title and likely never will.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I don't see the indie guys as particularly insular, there is insularity to a degree but generally I see people wanting others to see their cool thing rather than wanting to keep it exclusive.  Such insularity as there is is driven more I think by people being happy with their trad games than the indie crowd just talking to themselves.  For once the stars are at fault I think and not yourselves.                        </div>

<strong>...a wasteland of bickering factions</strong>.  <br/><br/>During the early days of the revolution, it was easy to maintain a cohesive community of outsiders, fighting together to advance RPGs past the status quo that was maintained by the major publishers.  <br/><br/>Later though, when the indie games community began to gain in terms of both size and success, the schisms began.  Things were said in haste or anger, feelings were hurt, friendships were damaged, and many of the various circles created by the diaspora gave up on the idea of one shared community of designers, instead choosing to deal only with a small group of like-minded friends.  A minority of these decided that it was important not only to advance their own theories, but to attack those who didn't support their idea of the One True Way.  More and more online venues came to be dominated by venomous words rather than thoughtful discussions, and what remained of a thriving indie RPG community became increasingly factionalized and insular.                        </div>

Dude, word.  We're looking dead at this at the local cons where we've made a concerted effort to run indie games. We are increasingly forming a little clique of people who come to play indie games, sometimes exclusively.  While creating a community of play is <em>totally awesome</em> our original goal was to introduce new players, and we're having trouble continuing to do that.  Our short-term successes are getting in the way of our long-term goals.                        </div>

                            Y'know what? Us indie folks should run trad games in the genres that are similar to the indie games we like. Say you run 4 rockin' hours of D&amp;D, informed by things like flags and scene framing and so on, and then at the end go "if you had a good time, I'm running this game called The Shadow of Yesterday tomorrow. It's an indie fantasy game that takes a different perspective on how mechanics inform game play. I still have some slots if your interested."<br/><br/>Hell, port the same characters. "I'm running this scenario again tomorrow, but with this game called Burning Wheel. It's really neat how different sets of mechanics create different games. You wanna check it out?"                        </div>

                            Why proselytise?  If the games are good and you post honestly about them then people will listen, people already do.  Running comparison games seems more about trying to convert people, why?  I think it's a mistake to compare the indie games to trad games, or indeed other indie games.<br/><br/>PTA can do BSG better than the BSG licenced game does not sell me, PTA can do a kickass BSG game does.  There's no need to proselytise, it's enough to talk honestly about why the games are fun.<br/><br/>One clear example, the Deep in the Blue actual play thread for PTA on the Forge?  That thread literally sold me the game, I read the thread then went and bought PTA.  No proselytising, no evangelism, just seriously kickass play honestly described.<br/><br/>Who wants to be an evangelist?  Does anyone you know enjoy being evangelised to?  When the Mormons or the Jehovah's knock on your door are you glad they're there?  I would say don't be those guys, don't evangelise, people can smell it and generally don't like it.  People can also smell honest fun, and they do like that.<br/><br/>A while back someone started a thread on rpg.net which was designed to lead eventually to some particular indie nostrum, I forget which one.  But, stupidly, he dressed it up originally as a disinterested query and then tried to guide the discussion to the outcome.  When it came out he had an agenda in mind from the outset the thread died, not nastily, there weren't flames, but people felt used and stopped bothering to respond.  Had he set out saying "hey, I do this indie thing and it's working really well for me" I think he'd have fared a hell of a lot better.<br/><br/>I think a sizeable chunk of the hostility the Forge sometimes gets is due to misguided attempts to evangelise, which comes across as patronising, instead of simply and honestly describing why stuff is fun.  This game is better than what you're used to is kind of insulting, this game rocks is not.  The latter is better.                        </div>

What we should do is start evangelizing indie games back at the Jehovah's Witnesses!  When they next knock on your door, pull out Dogs in the Vineyard.  It's so perfect for the task, it's silly.                        </div>

FWIW, my anecdotal evidence is:
<ul>
<li>The guys in my D&amp;D group pretty much buy D&amp;D books. If it's not D&amp;D, it's d20.</li>
<li>The people in my HERO group pretty much buy HERO books.</li>
</ul>
Myself and one couple in the HERO group are the only ones who deviate from this pattern, and I'm the only one who really buys indie product.<br/><br/>At GenCon, I bought about 14 RPG books: three for HERO, about three for d20, Serenity... and the rest were all indie games and all over the place (Artesia, Universails, TSoY, TMW, Polaris, InSpectres, HeroQuest, etc.). I would have bought more indie stuff but I ran out fo money. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> It's very unlikely I would ever spend that diversely on mainstream games.                        </div>

You know, I'd love to see an actually honest-to-god independent survey of this.  AFAIK, whenever gamers have been surveyed, it's been attached to a product, (how did you hear about MangleToads®?)  Man, where's Jess Hammer when you need her?                        </div>

<strong>...a healthy movement, enervated by debate and free thought.</strong><br/><br/>If we can discard the idea of a One True Way, and each pick up My Way, or even Our Way, then we can form a stronger community as a result.

Not everyone follows forums and blogs and what have you. I know lots of local gamers, and most of them don't even know about RPG.net. I'm not saying they don't read it...they've never even heard of it. And that's a fairly large, well-known site.<br/>

Now it's one of my five favorite games.<br><br>I don't see it as proselytizing, just another avenue for marketing.<br/><br/>I don't see that as proselytising either.  I was responding to suggestions that people evangelise or deliberately run comparison games with trad games.  I think those are dreadful ideas.<br/><br/>By contrast, telling people that you had fun with a game or running demos at cons, that's not evangelising it's just giving people an opportunity to check the game out.  It's positive, which is the key difference, it's not about converting people as if this were some religious thing, it's about sharing a fun thing is good.<br/><br/>Setting out to let people know there is a thing they might enjoy and giving them the opportunity to try it is great, setting out to convert people from playing stuff they enjoy to playing something else is silly and IMO deeply counterproductive.  If someone said to me "hey, check out PTA, it's far better than that crap you're playing now" even if they put it politely I would tell them to fuck off as it's basically insulting.  If by contrast someone said "hey, check out PTA, it's a ton of fun" I might well do so.  There's no implication there that I'm waiting to hear the good word and am currently languishing in ignorance.<br/><br/>Evangelism creates unnecessary resistance.  If the game is genuinely good, once people get the chance to play it they will see that.  Evangelism is only necessary if you don't trust the underlying product.  Trust the product, the games are good, you don't need to convert people, just give them the chance to hear about them and play them. <br/><br/>And anyway, I don't get this whole conversion vibe, why if I like PTA do I have to forswear Call of Cthulhu?  For lo, indie gaming is a jealous god and thou shalt have no other games before it.  Silly, and a barrier to getting people to play what ultimately are fun games.<br/><br/>I trust the product.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Dunno, man. I only looked into indie games because a friend was ranting about how Sorcerer could do a dark, modern, supernatural game better than WoD. I was pretty much out of gaming at that point -- I only went to a few local LARPs just to hang out with friends in the diner afterwards. If he'd just said, "Yeah, Sorcerer is a great game and I have a lot of fun playing it," I'd have ignored it as just another RPG.<br/><br/>So, for myself, that sort of pitch was what I needed, because my gaming wasn't satisfying anymore. For someone who's still enjoying the games he's playing, it might be a different story.                        </div>

Now, you only get silly when you say "we should use these games to resolve world events."  The same as when video gamers say "we should have Mortal Combat vs King of Fighters Beta Super III EX competitions instead of wars."<br/><br/>But spin it around: we should look at what we do know as a games.  Horribly broken games, with miserable reward cycles, that don't do anything like what the majority of stake holders want them to do.  Recognize that the thing is that the rules are written by the most skillful players, and look for ways to change the rules so that we actually get what we want and need out of them.  This is basically my argument that everything (in the US) begins with campaign finance reform.                        </div>

I don't understand that, too. There are trad games that are excellent, and there are trad games that suck ass. There are indie games that rock, and indie games that suck ass. There's no need to make such a distintion as 'I'm an indie gamer.' That seem snobbish to me.                        </div>

                            If I didn't know better, I'd think that Nathan's post has some people reacting defensively. Are you actually afraid that people are going to be converted away from Call of Cthulhu? If so, aren't you admitting that it's an inferior game? If it's not...then what are you worried about? <br/><br/>You're really concerned that Nathan is going to make an ass of himself by suggesting that people try other games after running one of their favorites? Or that people who play indie games are going to turn into some sort of cult, and that's going to alienate people? <br/><br/>Or...what?<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Well,<br/><br/>Bear in mind it was subsequently clarified that I had misread him.  That said, my point was more that it was a really crappy way of selling indie games that created needless barriers, that there is no need to force people to make a choice and if you do so you needlessly limit the appeal of your game.  The whole "you will be assimilated" approach which I have seen used occasionally at rpg.net tends to create ill feeling and is a really crappy way to market stuff.  In particular, calls to evangelise I think really miss the point about how to effectively market these games.<br/><br/>Simple as that really.  However, it got clarified that there was no argument here for implying one had to be converted anyway, so the point rather went away.  I suspect Imperator just hasn't got to that bit of the thread yet, and being an rpg.netter like me probably read the op in light of other comments seen elsewhere which tried to sell one game by knocking another (which in any context rarely works).<br/><br/>Edit:  I'm getting my threads mixed up.  I was reacting more to the idea of evangelising which seems to me a really bad idea, Nathan's I didn't like simply because I think it's generally better to sell the game you're there to sell than show how it works better than some other game.                        </div>

Quoted for truth. I didn't realize this thread was six years old until I saw this post saying it was six years old. I thought the Jasons' comments were about some other thread, and was confused why there wasn't a link.                        </div>

Mind = Fucked. Reading the thread, and then getting to Jason's post was a weird experience. I wondered how we had gotten 52 posts in the hour I'd been away from s-g.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthew D. Gandy</cite><b>...a grassroots revolution.</b>Indie games are viral: demo them, play them, and you become infected. Your only recourse is to pass on the infection. Slowly, bit by bit, players are introduced to new (not really) and different ways to play roleplaying games.<em>ZOMG! Players can narrate! You don't need a GM! Losing can be cool! You can resolve conflicts rather than tasks!</em>The games themselves aren't bestsellers and are never marketed as such, but they have a cache all their own. People rethink their expectations of traditional RPGs. Generic systems wane, house rules and games designed for a specific purpose increase.</blockquote>

In 2006, the same was true with different titles: Primetime Adventures, Dread, the Mountain Witch, Burning Empires, Don't Rest Your Head, Gumshoe, Spirit of the Century, and D&amp;D 4th Edition. I literally could swap in these titles and reach the same conclusion, that something huge is JUST ABOUT to happen.<br/><br/>Nooo. Don't do that. I almost always predict nothing will change and I am virtually always right.<br/><br/>(There were a couple of other games that deserved to have wider impact, like Capes, carry, Full Light, Full Steam and Mortal Coil from that time frame, of course, but I'm just thinking back to the buzz around that time frame..)                        </div>
