Buzz had come to collect her as a favour since Astrid had rescued him from his gambling debts in the past. <br/><br/>I had decided on a Psi theme worked up some rough fronts based on a new psi-suppressing subsector duke, a fugitive on their current world and the general imperial anti-psi prejudice. The fugitive turned out to be Fleur Tyrell, an ex-mob insider who had cleaned out the local operations and wanted off-world fast, but not before he collected his ex-military cousin Kiara for some muscle. At an awkward moment Fleur revealed that he was also a psi and so he didn't want to meet the imperial forces massing on the planet for "morale building". They fled that world and Fleur made the players an offer - he would bankroll them if they helped him find and make contact with a psionic institute, there was rumoured to be one in the subsector. Upon completion he'd make them rich beyond their wildest dreams (although Astrid proved to have some pretty wild dreams). That was session 1. Session 2 was spent in the oppressive (if you're poor) playground for the rich that Astrid comes from. No psis there. So on to Baskan (next message below) where a 3rd player (Holtz) joined us. Incidentally the shared world design that features in most sessions is working well - I must try to document the process to make it more repeatable for people. Mainly just AW stuff - ask questions, draw maps, look for conflict.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393544/#Comment_393544" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-16T08:55:59+00:00" title="October 16, 2012  8:55AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TW: PSIs Like Us - Update 1 by Player E (Astrid)<br/><br/>Baskan (High Population / Poor)<br/><br/>On the way in from the jump exit we referred to our TAS database to<br/>get the basics on the planet.<br/><br/>This is an early-stellar technology world, with 10s of billions of<br/>people.  They don't have a lot of industry and virtually no exports.<br/>The star port is D class which means the facilities are pretty basic,<br/>essentially a patch of concrete for each ship to land on and a handful<br/>of buildings to house customs and ground control, There is no repair<br/>facility and refined fuel is not available.  Luckily our trusty Scout<br/>ship operates just fine on unrefined fuel (or at least as fine as it<br/>ever does).<br/><br/>Early Stellar might mean a bit behind the curve for the Imperium but<br/>it's important to remember they have all the tech toys that early 21st<br/>century earth has and more.  This is not a primitive planet.  Holtz<br/>will find this out later.<br/><br/>Supporting the high population requires the planet to be run as<br/>efficiently as possible.  The people almost universally live in huge,<br/>high density cities which tower kilometers high and cover areas up to<br/>a quarter of a million square kilometers.  There are 8 to 10 of these<br/>megacities and they can easily be seen from orbit.  Outside the cities<br/>there are vast fields of monoculture crops, patrolled by large robotic<br/>combination agri-machines.  Around the coast the sea is a patchwork of<br/>aquaculture farms also primarily maintained by robotic machines.<br/>Efficiency is the watch word, not variety.  The population subsists<br/>mostly on the two Ks, Kale and Kelp.<br/><br/>We wanted a high population world for plot reasons and since this is a<br/>positive tag we needed to select a negative tag to balance it out and<br/>'poor' was chosen.  As usual we were asked to think about what was<br/>special or interesting about this planet and we came up with the giant<br/>city and food issues.  I see it as kind of a cross between Mega City<br/>One and Soylent Green.  Of course that's not entirely accurate since<br/>with no tag indicating otherwise this planet has a moderate law level.<br/> There are police but they are quite reasonable.<br/><br/>We land and manage to find a broker to take on the cargo we were<br/>carrying (mainly to disguise our real reason for travelling).<br/>Compared to the giant hive cities where the native population live<br/>star town is more like a shanty town.  It is a low density district<br/>that grew up around the port.  We decide we will do like we did<br/>before, operate as normal, try to get cargo and talk to brokers,<br/>traders, the star port authority and if we happen to hear something<br/>about psionics that's fine.  Astrid and Buzz are are walking through<br/>star town when we meet Holtz.  This is an ex-Army guy that Buzz knows<br/>pretty well and Astrid met once while trying to negotiate a supply<br/>contract with an Army base.<br/><br/>Holtz' player uses the normal character generation hx statements to<br/>determine the relationship with Astrid and Buzz.<br/><br/>Holtz wants off Baskan (apparently kelp beer is not really to his<br/>taste) and having a passenger we can trust helps us with our cover so<br/>this is win-win.  We basically agree to carry him off world when we<br/>are leaving although we warn him this might not be for a few weeks.<br/>Astrid doesn't see why he shouldn't pay passage but Buzz feels he can<br/>do Holtz a favour and allow him to work for his passage.<br/><br/>As the group is discussing this a shout / scream is heard from a<br/>nearby building and Astrid realises (10+ Read a Situation) that the<br/>noise came from an upper floor of a nearby building, a side door<br/>appears to have been forced and a thuggish looking local is standing<br/>guard with a bat.  Despite pleas from Astrid to 'not get involved'<br/>Holtz rushes off and Buzz follows.  Holtz scares the guard away (7-9<br/>Go Aggro) but he runs in to the building and barricades the door<br/>behind him.  Luckily whoever broke the door open in the first place<br/>has damaged it so badly that it won't remain closed.  Holtz and Buzz<br/>rush in and Astrid stays outside to keep watch.<br/><br/>On the upper floor the boys, in some sort of gang clothing, find a<br/>handful of men holding a girl.  They are beating her and coming out<br/>with phrases like 'good enough treatment for one of THEM'.  It appears<br/>they are anti-psionic vigilantes and the girl is a suspected psi.<br/>Holtz intimidates them by putting a bullet in someone's leg (Go Aggro<br/>7-9).  They drop the girl and flee.<br/><br/>Meanwhile outside Astrid notices a crowd forming.  A woman points at<br/>Astrid and gestures.  Sirens are heard in the distance.<br/><br/>Inside Holtz does some first aid on the girl and stabilises her.  Buzz<br/>checks out the funny hat the thugs left behind and it's got some sort<br/>of flexible circuity embedded in the fabric.  Its the early stellar<br/>version of the tin foil hat.  Holtz picks up the girl and he and Buzz<br/>try to get out following the same route the thugs used.  Unfortunately<br/>Holtz does not excel at the sneaking and when he bursts out the back<br/>door there are armed police waiting for him.  "Put down the gun!" -<br/>"I'm not the one you want!" -  -<br/>"PUT. DOWN. THE. GUN".  (No good at manipulate, go aggro not wise!)<br/><br/>Holtz is arrested.  Buzz escapes unnoticed and meets up with Astrid<br/>who has talked her way out of the suspicion she was involved with the<br/>incident.  Buzz tries to get hold of Fleur but he can't talk.<br/><br/>Holtz tries to claim initially that he didn't fire any shots but the<br/>police quickly prove that his gun was fired recently.  His claims that<br/>he fires his gun every day does not endear him to them.  He claims<br/>that the fired a warning shot but by this stage they have a<br/>holographic forensic reconstruction that clearly shows Holtz fired a<br/>shot in to the leg of one of the missing people.  As a proven liar<br/>they pretty much discount his claims that he was just defending the<br/>girl.  <br/><br/>Buzz and Astrid locate Holtz in the local police station and organise<br/>a bail bondsman and a lawyer so that he can be released.  Holtz is<br/>sent back to the ship to think about what he did while Buzz and Astrid<br/>go to the hospital where the girl was brought.  Buzz waits downstairs<br/>and Astrid goes up to talk to her.  The girl is very suspicious and<br/>almost immediately rings the alarm.  Astrid is caught by security but<br/>lies her way out of it.<br/><br/>Back on the ship Astrid confirms that the special hat is an actual<br/>functioning device that generates some sort of energy cancelling<br/>field.  When Fleur arrives back he confirms that it does block his<br/>mind reading powers to an extent.  It's not in the same class and<br/>imperial military psi-shields but it has some effect.  He also<br/>indicates that the extremely high density of people in the city made<br/>it difficult for him, the pressure of their thoughts gave him severe<br/>headaches.  When he hears what happened in the hospital he accuses<br/>Astrid of trying to deliberately sabotage the mission and claims he<br/>needs lucky people like Holtz not people like Astrid.  Buzz brings him<br/>to the hospital and from a distance he is able to determine that the<br/>girl is in fact psionic.<br/><br/>Meanwhile on the ship the local news reports indicate that there was<br/>an explosion in a sector of the capital city known to be home to a<br/>significant number of 'Freelanders'.  Researching news items for the<br/>last few months indicates that have been infrequent, but increasing,<br/>incidents of violence started by the 'Freelander' movement.  People<br/>who want to be allowed to found a new home away from all the existing<br/>mega-cities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sharnett" title="sharnett"><img alt="sharnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sharnett">sharnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393655/#Comment_393655" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-17T03:27:39+00:00" title="October 17, 2012  3:27AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those sound like a couple of awesome sessions, Robb.

Select travel destination (move: look up in library data)<br/><br/> - Working really well, we are dynamically filling in a subsector map as places come up in play/char-gen/we need to jump<br/><br/>2. Move ship by jump/m-drives (move: make hazardous<br/>journey)<br/><br/>-Working well, sometimes I split this into up into 2-3 hazardous journey moves (m-drive to orbit/jump-point, j-drive to other system, m-drive to world) depending on the fiction and where the session ends. <br/><br/>3. Spend a week on planet looking for work/cargos<br/>(moves: starship operations, living off your savings and<br/>small-time jobs, looking for a lucrative opportunity,<br/>starship gigs)<br/><br/>- starship operations is doing what it should, eliminating paperwork but revealing *wants* that the players can explore. looking for a lucrative opportunity is a bit of a mess as it really needs to be split into 2 moves (one based on SOC, one on SHARP) but it is usable as is. Starship gigs need further work, they are presently a way of snowballing from starship operations but in an off-screen way. Hmmm.<br/><br/>4. Generate patron + mission or starship gigs<br/><br/>- I haven't used this so much as "announce future badness" and the Patron threat moves, my PCs are on a long-term mission for Fleur. <br/><br/>5. Execute mission/gig: can roll to see where play starts<br/><br/>- I haven't used this yet, but I may do so at tonights game now that you've given me a push!<br/><br/>6.

As threatened I tested the patron mission generation/situation. I selected "delivery" and allowed the PCs to roll +Sharp to find out where they were. They got a 7-9 "awkward package".<br/>It worked well!<br/>This is how my player, E, wrote it up:<br/><br/>Last week on Bascan:<br/><br/>We hired Sol a criminal attorney to defend Holtz.  Actually we want<br/>him to organise a deposition of Alba so we can get her and Fleur in<br/>the same room.<br/><br/>Alba is very suspicious.  She calls so say she knows what is going on<br/>and that Astrid is lurking in the vehicle down the street.  She<br/>demands we ditch our weapons and then she will meet us.  We agree and<br/>tell Sol to go entertain himself at the bar while we talk.  Alba<br/>agrees to introduce Fleur to some people if we do a job for her.<br/><br/>We have to collect a package and get it in to the star port then<br/>deliver it to another ship which is waiting.  The package will trigger<br/>radiological alarms so we need to do something to prevent that.  We<br/>buy a ship component which contains radioactives and Astrid rigs it so<br/>that it will short out and produce a brief but high intensity burst of<br/>radiation after a short amount of time. We send Holtz through the main<br/>gate and when he trips the radiation warnings we slip through a<br/>vehicle gate undetected.  Since Holtz really only appears guilty of<br/>buying a defective component he just gets a fine.<br/><br/>Having proved ourselves later we get details of the meeting and go<br/>there.  The location is in a very bad area of the city, known as a<br/>nest of Free Lander activity.  Hooded men bring us inside and force<br/>all the normal people to go downstairs (through a hole cut in to the<br/>apartment below) while they interrogate Fleur.  A time later they come<br/>down.  Their 'testing' of Fleur has broken his mind, he's moving but<br/>he doesn't appear to be able to think for himself. Unfortunate but the<br/>hooded men have a proposal. From rifling through Fleurs mind (none too<br/>gently it appears) they know a lot about us.  They propose that we use<br/>Astrids connections on her homeworld, Fleurs money and their powers to set<br/>up a successful corporation. This will be used to smuggle psi's off<br/>Bascan and will be a power base for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
