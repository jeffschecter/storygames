For some months I'm reading and translating articles and other stuff about RPG, especially theory to Hungarian (my mother tongue).<br/><br/>I always felt that the GNS or the Big Model articles themselves are too abstract to use directly on playing or designing. It was kinda just a set of perceptions of the different modes of play etc., but didn't find in the articles anything that would help directly in actual things. Yes, I could check what is stated about my design or play technique, but I couldn't possibly change my playing or designing habits based on GNS. I could use it only as a help for my intuition, but not directly, logically, conciously.<br/><br/>I was thinking about the different GNS modes (interestingly Mendel Schmiedekamp's PCon3 helped me a lot in this) and came up with this:<br/><br/>While playing there are only three real participants in the game, no more: the players (the GM etc.), the rules (the book, the sourcetexts etc.) and the imagined reality (world, setting, characters etc.). (Okay, maybe there is still the real world, but it is a subject of later examination.) Let's imagine these three participants as three different but equally important objects and there are links between each of them - this means three types of links: the player-fantasy, the fantasy-rules and the player-rules. (Sorry if I didn't choose the right words, please correct me in these regards.)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://algi.web.elte.hu/rpg/pics/gns_full_sim_eng.gif"/><br/><br/>The Simulationist mode inclines to strengthen the links between fantasy and rules. That means the rules have to be faithful to the imagined world (that's a desing question) and the world has to behave as the rules tell (that's a play technique question). But the most interesting is, that the players try to immerse into their characters in the sense that they are trying to steer the PCs as if they were part of the imagined world. (In reality they are more part of each of the real players then the shared imagination.) That means, that the links that go through the players have to be more like the ones that go directly from rules to shared imagination and back. I would mark this on a diagram if the player would go closer to the rules-fantasy link and the links going through the player would be closer to parallel to them. The means, that the players want to disappear as if they didn't exist and their characters would act as on their own. I think this is the concept that scares the anti-RPG people. And this feature is most times called "the real role-playing".<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://algi.web.elte.hu/rpg/pics/gns_fullness_gam_eng.gif"/><br/><br/>The Gamist mode means that the players incline to strengthen the player-rules links, that means the players try to play optimally within the confines of the rules. It is always stated that the RPGs are not games in the mathematical sense. But in this case I do say that the players find covert goals, so they are in reality truly playing small mathematical games except: these games are difficultly intervoven, because the players don't have to check with each others goals, so the other players not always try to win one player's mathematical subgame. That means designing and playing Gamist RPG I have to look into mathematical games. Although there is some problem with this: the rules in this comment not only includes the "numbers" rules, but it contains the setting description of an RPG. It is because a Gamist player can always refer to the world description for his/her character's own good. In my little diagram: the imagined world becomes only the realization of the rules to the player, it is the interface between the player and the rules, so the links going through the shared imagination become more like parallel to the direct player-rules links.<br/><br/>And now I see why the Gamist and Simulationist players can ruin each others playing experience: in both cases the imagined world and the rules have a very tight link, but while the former players try to vanish, the latter players treat themeselves more important than the imagined world. The common groud (tight fantasy-rules links) help to mingle the Gam and Sim players, than the difference (priority of player's role) ruins their gaming experience.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://algi.web.elte.hu/rpg/pics/gns_full_nar_eng.gif"/><br/><br/>The Narrativist mode is the third possible outcome: the players actively and directly try to interfere with the imagined world (to write the story), and thatswhy the rules of a Nar game has to work as a manipulator arm that the players use to control the imagined world. That means: the rules have to work like the links going through the rules are more like parallel to the players-fantasy links. This means that while the rules of the Gam and Sim games are very similar in the tight rules-world links, the Narrativist rules have to be quite different. The other thing is: the Narrativist mode is inacceptable for Sim players, because the rules don't help the players to vanish, it even makes them more important. The Gam players can enjoy Nar games, they not even enjoy, but the Nar and Gam players don't disturbe each others playing experience: both are there to fight for the control of the story.<br/><br/>I think these two (that the Nar rules are highly different from Sim and Gam rules AND the players don't disturbe each others experience) led to the forming of the strong Nar indie culture.<br/><br/>I see it like this, but I can be mistaken. I also think that this kinda model does not only show that there can be no fourth GNS mode, but it helps people to actually <i>use</i> the GNS for playing and designing.<br/><br/>What do you think about this model? Is this totally flawed or is it trivial and overdiscussed or is it something new? (I hope the latter.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58189/#Comment_58189" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T02:00:25+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  2:00AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite>Let's imagine these three participants as three different but equally important objects and there are links between each of them - this means three types of links: the player-fantasy, the fantasy-rules and the player-rules.

But I wonder if you're not putting too much weight on the discussion of rules and imagined content.<br/>\nA Creative Agenda (what used to be called a GNS mode), is really just about what kind of creativity people want to get out of their game.

I'm no expert, so this post is not meant to be taken as I presenting myself as an authority, but to contrast to your post and hopefully increase the discussion I assume you are looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me I look at GNS as a reward system. I don't take the view of it as an identity system. What I mean by this is-- a coherent game can be Gamist in that it rewards for Gamist goals. A player may only like gaming groups that reward Gamist play, but it's the play that is Gamist not the player. Some players enjoy any branch of coherent GNS play, so you can't really attach a label to them. I make this distinction between individuals and gameplay as in my experience, the introduction of GNS to folks who are unfamiliar with GNS tends to cause division as people label themselves, and then friction develops over those labels, and many times the labels are improperly applied. I've met people who avoid taking chances who identify themselves as Gamist's, and folks who are all about the creation of drama identifying themselves as Simulationists. I think this way of individualizing GNS confuses the issue of what GNS is-- as once someone associates themselves with a title they seem to become less objective, and more defensive, about the title's meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo GNS as a reward system means what exactly? A gaming group that is firing on all cylinders and everyone is having fun is typically strongly rewarding one or perhaps two styles of play. This is coherent play. It can be difficult to identify as most roleplaying tends to have all the elements that are attached to GNS when people think about it on an individual level, or in a specific instance. Also since coherent play can have two elements of GNS it may be hard to pick the reward out. So what can we do to identify GNS is look at overall trends to see what kind of play is rewarded not only by the game system, but by the encouragement or engagement of other players. Alright, here we go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Gamism:</b> A Gamist game will have risk. It will have challenge.The characters will face actual risk. The players will want this risk, as the fun is accepting the challenge and overcoming it. If bad moves are possible you may be looking at Gamist play. If the phrase, "Let the dice fall where they may." is something the group honestly believes then you are likely looking at a Gamist group. Ron refers to Gamist play as "Step on up." So for instance a Gamist game about Samurai, would likely reward players for surviving duels and battles, or killing monsters. I think focusing on mathematical rules is a bit of a misstep when thinking about Gamism, as complex systems can just as easily support Simulationism, I'll address this after Simulationism and Narritivism.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Simulationism:</b> Ron refers to this as," the right to dream." This type of game will stress an internally consistent setting, and characters fitting into the setting. Players will be rewarded by good portrayals of their characters as defined by the setting. So for instance, in a game about Samurai, players would be rewarded for things like following the code of Bushido, and likely punished either through the fiction or actual game mechanics for going against the Bushido code. I think focusing on immersion here is close but can be a misstep as there are several types of immersion which I'll address later in this post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Narritivism:</b> I'm not sure what Ron called this, but I call it a focus on drama. This type of game is concerned with dramatic stories. Players would be rewarded by making interesting additions to the story and could be punished by not having their additions allowed into the fiction. For instance many Narritivst games have a B.S. rule that allows other players or the gamemaster, depending on the game, to override someone elses contribution to the fiction. So in a Narritivist Samurai game a player might be rewarded for choosing to betray their lord, so they can be with their love from the enemy clan.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this making sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to address the things I put off. First let's look at complex systems. Complex systems can arise out of many things. A incoherent game may have a complex system due to a kitchen sink approach, in other words they throw in everything in an attempt to make everyone happy. I would hold the game Rolemaster up as an example of this. A complex system can be built around providing many tactical and strategic options, and this would definitely point to Gamism. I would hold of D+D 3E as an example of this. A complex system can be built around 'realism.' Realism can serve both Gamism or Simulationism, as the word can mean two different things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Simulationism the idea would be to make a consistent world that helps reinforce how the world works and thereby reinforce the ability to dream. If we know how the world works then we have a better understanding of it, and therefore a better ability to share our imagination of it. In Earthdawn there is much description of each culture in the game and their beliefs, how magic works, how magic weapons become more powerful over time, etc. Earthdawn explains all these things in a much more concise manner, tying all the elements logically together in a manner that exceeds typical fantasy roleplaying games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Gamism realism typically means that the game behaves in a manner where tactical choices that would matter in our world, matter in the game world also. A good example of this might be the old game, "Phoenix Command: The game of realistic gun combat." In Phoenix Command I once got shot in the spine with a 22 caliber pistol, taking 50000 points of damage. I hadn't been hurt yet in the game, and was very healthy so I had like 33 hit points, which left me at -49967.I then had to roll a 99 on percentile dice to stay conscious. After making the roll to much rejoicing at the table, I learned that I needed to now roll a 100 on percentile to live longer than a minute. In Phoenix Command taking cover matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, Gamism does not need complex systems. Dogs in the Vineyard has good Gamist rewards. The only way to gain experience is by getting in challenges. There are tactical options to how you build your character and what you do with your dice after you roll. It does this with a system that is fairly easy to understand after seeing it in action.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to address immersion. You don't have to be immersed to play in a Simulationist game. For instance the Gamemaster might not be immersed in a character and still enjoy the game. You could approach the game in author stance instead of actor stance. I believe in the Big Model that immersion is placed in the ephemera category, not in GNS for this reason?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll see how people reply to that, lets talk more about types of immersion. I can think of three types of immersion off the top of my head. For me all these forms of immersion occur in Actor stance. There is what I call Ego immersion which is where you are imagining yourself in the fiction and respond to the fiction as yourself. There is what I call Acting immersion where you are imaging yourself as a fictional character and respond in a manner appropriate to the personality you have crafted for the character. Lastly there is what I call Method immersion where you do not respond as yourself, but become the character and respond as that other person. In Method immersion, the person you normally identify with disappears to one degree or another, and is replaced by another person. I'm not sure what this last paragraph has to do with GNS, so I'll stop as I appear to be drifting off subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58282/#Comment_58282" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T10:10:56+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 10:10AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess when I read the post I was thinking "gee, much of the theory stuff tends to be pretty wordy."

I hope the diagrams posted here will help somewhat to clarify.<br><br>Christoph,<br><br>I am thinking about GNS as an amateur game designer and from this perspective I don't know what could be more important in an RPG than the rules and the imagined content. Sure, the players are even more important, but I have to project their Creative Agendas on my design before a player has even a glimpse of it. Mayba that is the cause of the weight of the rules and imagined content part. Other side: this all came to mind when I was reading Ron's essay "Simulationism: The Right to Dream" in wich he talks about the tight connection between the system (in this case engine) and the world. It was only a small step to incorporate the player in the model. It felt easy and simple and almost trivial, but it made me to realize many things (mostly stated in may first comment in this thread) that was obvious or seemed right. I admit, the simmetry of this view was compelling, too.<br><br>I think I have to explain what have I read till now, that you know what not. I have read regarding GNS only some basic things: System Does Matter, GNS and Other Matters of Role-Playing, Gamism: Step On Up, Simulationism: The Right to Dream and Narrativism: Story Now. I havn't read the Provisional Glossary and havn't participate in any theoretical discussion before. So Frank's summary didn't say anything new to me, at least I didn't see anything new in it. But Ben Lehman's essay is a bit difficult for me, so I'm going to have some time with it.<br><br>Clyde,<br><br>I think you misinterpreted something because I mischose some words and some things I've taken for granted. I didn't think that the GNS would refer to identity: I'm using Ron Edwards's terminology, at least that is stated in his essay. The term "Gam player" means that the player is at that time actually looking for Gam payoffs, or "Sim game" means that the rules of the game helps to get Sim payoffs. (I hope I use the word "payoff" correctly.) I think, the term "reward" is a bit confusing, because if you say reward system, I think about Exp and stuff like that. But the reward of Sim play is the Sim itself, the reward of Gam play is the contest itself and the reward of Nar is the influencing of the story. I think that a Gam player who loses a contest can it equally enjoy it, if the contest itself is exciting.<br><br>For the matter of complexity of the system and the realism of the system, I don't care about them regarding theory. Realism and complexity are only a design decision mostly based upon marketing or subjective reasons. I'm an amateur and a beginner, but I'm already thinking in marketing in these matters. If the system is complex or not, if the system is realistic or not, these are just colors. Surely, a historical RPG has to be realistic, but it is only a thematical decision and doesn't have to do anything with GNS.<br><br>About "immersion": sorry, I chose the wrong word. I forgot that it was defined in "GNS and other..." by Ron Edwards. The only thing I meant under immersion is the vanishing, the irrelevance of the players themselves. That is: in stron Sim game the players' irrelevance rules makes the players themselves irrelevant.<br><br>Regarding Gamism you misunderstood me. I didn't tell to focus on the mathematical rules. I told that the rules aren't only "numbers" rules, but even world descriptions. I told the you have to focus on mathematical <i>games</i> in Gamism. I meant it as game in mathematical sense. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory" rel="nofollow">Here you can find a description what I meant.</a> The thing is, that there is a mathamatical context of a situation and all of the participants strive to make the optimal decisions. This is only half true in this case: if a player does a Gam decision, that means, that (s)he crops the game to a subgame wich works like a mathematical game for (s)he. For example if a Gam player wants to win a fight, this subgame contains only the rules of the fight, the place where the fight is going on and the starting values (how many enemies and what do they wear, how many HPs do I have etc.). The player than tries to make optimal decisions regarding only this game and (wich is interesting and this is new for me, too) the irrelevance rules turn on again, and make everything else irrelevant <b>in the game</b> outside the subgame. I've just realized that that must be the reason that Gam players are that "dangerous" to others. They "don't care", because they play a subgame, and the ranting of the other players is like the ranting of the people in the other room who can't watch TV because the rattle of dice. It is irrelevant.<br><br>And there is something else: I think in Nar the most important thing is that the players are steering the story and not just watching it. I think that the statement the theme has to be important (moral etc.) is subjective. It is one of the mistakes Ron is always speaking about (for example synecdoche). If the players are doctors of physics and they are playing a sci-fi game, a fantastic new discovery can be important. It sounds like Sim game, but it is not the content that decides what is Nar and what is Sim. I think the only things that decide what is Nar, what is Sim and what is Gam it the creative agenda of the player, the function of the rules and the dynamics of the content.<br><br>Gabor<br><br/>ps.

It's not enough they have to read and understand the theory (wich can be the Big Model or any other), but they have to fully accept it. I think not every player is capable of tell about his/her covert agendas. The cause of the covertness of these agendas is not that they don't want to speak about it, but that they can't speak about is. If you ask someone about his/her gaming experience, the answer won't be anything you can use, it's just going to be: "We broke out of the prison of the Dark Lord, then we rescued the girl..." etc.<br/><br/>The most troublesome thing is to find out what someone premise is. It works like this: the player comes to me with the Player's Handbook in hand "Can I play with a sorcerer like this and that?" I tell him "Sure, except you can't do this and that." The fantasy classes (or the CP 2020 roles) is meant be simple character premises. But even in a D&amp;D party the player tells me "Yeah, okay, I can live with it.", but in reality, he cannot live with it and won't be happy at the gaming table because I eradicated one little thing that was important only to him, but would have affected the whole content of game.<br/><br/>It is troublesome and you can't (or your post tells me that you in particularly can) speak overtly about things that aren't concious, but are there. If it weren't like this, I don't know, what need would there be for any RPG theory or model. IMHO you are lucky with your party, but it always becomes a struggle if some player without the knowledge of theory comes to the table. I think, that the RPG designs have to be like that without any knowledge of theories they have to be playable and enjoyable.<br/><br/>I think I made sense. And take a look at the new diagrams in the first post, I think those unwordifies is somewhat.<br/><br/>Gabor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58321/#Comment_58321" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T11:44:31+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 11:44AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2007 11:45AM by Alex.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gabor,<br/><br/>I'll preface this by saying that I, too, don't have a super-deep background in Forge theory.<br/><br/>Your thing about subgames reminds me of something in <i>Rules of Play</i> (Salen and Zimmerman, 2004), a general game design book. Specifically, the book cites Greg Costikyan in claiming that, if your definition of "game" is focused on victory conditions, then the traditional RPG is more like a framework for games than a game itself -- the most obvious "game" in a Gamist RPG is on the scale of a scene/encounter or scenario/adventure rather than the whole thing as one monolithic unit. If you've ever had a forum discussion about D&amp;D, for example, you've heard the mantra "You can't win D&amp;D" repeated a lot; but you can <i>totally</i> win a scene or adventure in D&amp;D in a very concrete, non-handwavy sense, because those things do have very precise goals even if the larger encapsulating structure (the campaign) does not.<br/><br/>If you look at how a lot of modern RPG designers, especially folks on the Forge, are approaching RPG design, this kind of explanation feels off, though: I certainly couldn't call a session of <i>Polaris</i> a series of games, and you can barely talk about winning and losing a roll in <i>carry</i> (contrast to D&amp;D: if your character succeeds on a check, you have, as a player, also succeeded), much less winning and losing on the level of a scene or a session. There's something else going on. And I think <a href="http://benlehman.thesmerf.com/?p=91" rel="nofollow">this part of Ben Lehman's Forge Theory essay</a> speaks to what that is: for a lot of the folks playing indie games and story games and whatnot, the "game" as a set of rules and victory conditions just isn't a priority at all. Those things are there to guide the social contract a bit, but seen as almost irrelevant beyond that. The narrative of play and the social rules of play eclipse the written rules of an RPG so much that the only formal procedural rules we really find meaningful are the ones we drag up onto the social level. And that's what makes Forge-y RPG design so different from just regular ol' game design, in my mind.<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58351/#Comment_58351" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T12:49:06+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 12:49PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite>Eruditus:<br/><br/>My experience tells that it doesn't help to speak with the players.</blockquote>\nAlthough I sympathize with your experience (and I know it's an issue with some players) it's my opinion that play cannot maturely happen without the overt social contract.  Namely, as a player you don't have to be telling me the truth about your feelings but rather understand that you will have more fun if you do and if you don't your the one breaking the social contract.  I mean a player can have a real problem with four color mentality (this is an actual scenario) but a GM says this supers game will have all the four color assumptions - hero names, costumes, focus on front-line action.  The player can disagree until the cows come home but if that player says they will play under the assumptions of the game and complains or acts against those assumptions then it is the player that is at fault.  I think a clear line of accountability is an important part of the equation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58369/#Comment_58369" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T13:46:53+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  1:46PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do have a deep understanding of Forge Theory. For whatever that's worth (people seemed to be identifying)...<br/>\n<br/>\nTake this in the spirit in which it's offered.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have an interesting model, but it's not GNS. Nor is it Big Theory. The one major difference in your model is that you're saying that system is not a methodology, but a "player" in a relationship with the other two functioning elements that are involved. By the Lumpley Principle, system is whatever you're using to agree to the SIS. So I don't see how it's possible to be "closer" to the system as you put it. You're always 100% engaged with the system of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Lumpley.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don't think this is at all Ron's model in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, who cares? That is, I think that your model might have some practicality of it's own and validity. In theory. You'd need to have more solid definitions for some things. Basically I think you have an idea of what the SI is, and system is that don't match the old theory. If you can come up with what you mean by these things, I think you might have something.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe I'm just not seeing what you're saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut let's try a practical examination: you say that the sim mode means, practically for designers, that the rules have to be faithful to the imagined world. But how is this not also important for narrativism and gamism? If by "faithful" you're saying "should help promote the feeling of internal exploration (what I've sometimes called Fecundity), the question is how we get that from your model?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, how do you draw the conclusion that a strong relationship between rules and SI requires this sort of quality? There's an intuitive leap you're making here. Which seems to make this tautological. Like, "The link between system and SI is like Sim becuase it is." Put another way, if you didn't have GNS sim to work with as a goal, would somebody looking at the model have been able to predict your conclusion here? To make it practical?<br/>\n<br/>\nWorse, this is, in fact, a practical outcome of Sim that the old system already has come up with. That is, even if it is equivalent to GNS Sim, then what does this model predict that the old one did not? Does it actually meet your goal of being more practical?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust the tough questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I agree that it's useful to be able to talk about play preferences if you can. So to the extent that this is potentially easier to grok, it would help there. That said, I think that getting to any level of understanding of this sort of idea is rare, and will always be likely to cause trouble with the player being casually exposed to it. That is, if the player isn't willing to learn theory in depth - and most should not be - then it's almost always going to be more trouble than it's worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's more, if you know the theory, you can usually figure out player preferences from their actions in play. As a diagnostic of play GNS works fine, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, if the game is well written, GNS issues are unlikely to ever be a problem. In which case you need neither diagnostics, nor a need to discuss these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut another way, I play with lots of different people, using good systems, and I only very rarely talk about theory at all with my players. With most players not at all ever. I don't need to. The theory has already done it's job.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one more thing - GNS is old. That is, the Big Theory doesn't really delve into it much any more. And that's probably for a good reason. GNS is just one particular categorization of agendas. You can categorize agenda in other ways just as effectively (do the players like actor stance or not?). So coming up with a better way to describe a record player still doesn't make it a CD player. If you catch my analogy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58412/#Comment_58412" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T17:03:58+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  5:03PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2007 5:19PM by Call Me Curly.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br>I think you have an interesting model, but it's not GNS.

I realized that it was too intuitive and the definitions of the links were somewhat arbitary. Not to say about my choosing of words: I hate to bring this up, because it won't be better for you, but it is really hard not to retranslate to a new word the "official" terms translated from English. I'm going to try to use the original ones or contain new definitions for the time being.<br/><br/>I think I have to explain the origin of the model. I tried to unite Ron Edwards' GNS (part of the Big Model, nto the Big Model), Mendel Schmiedekamp's PCon3 and Greg Schneider's Methods of Character Creation (the latter was not intended a theory, rather a technique, but I think it is theorish enough). I think I won't achieve that now, but this is its by-product.<br/><br/>So, my first post is ground zero, and the following should be considered instead (it's not that different, really):<br/><br/>Let's have a look at the mind of a player, that is while playing. First, the irrelevance rules kick in and everything "vanishes" that does not participate in the game. Second, the constitutive rules "transform" everything that participates in the game to something else. The words and numbers on the character sheet become the character itself or a part of the character. Nothing much is left from the real world, and wich is left is projected into the imagined world. My first statement is: only three important things remain in the subjective world of a player: the individuum, the regulative rules and the shared imagined content. Every each of them can have real world tokens, but the central aspects of these three "powers" are in the mind of a player.<br/><br/>Individuum (IND or I): The individual strategy, background, subjective feelings, tastes etc. The nature of the individuum is decisionmaking, and it fights to cover bigger part of the other (shared) powers.<br/><br/>Regulative Rules (REG or R): These are the game rules that the player knows about and how (s)he knows them. It is not the same as the rulesbook, because the memory isn't perfect not to speak about logic. This is the image of the rulesbook in the mind of a player. At the first time these aren't the rules agreed upon, but these are the rules that are read from the rulesbook. Later it can be modified by agreements, but it is a more difficult story. (See later.) I hope it is no surprise: the players know the rules differently. The natrue of the rules is to "cover" things. (Tell me, if you know a better word.)<br/><br/>Shared Imagined Content (SIC or S): This is the imagined content of the world. As the REG is an image of the rules in the mind of a player, the SIC (sorry for the funny term) is the image of the in-game conversation among the players. (In-game doesn't have to mean in-character.) Like with REG, SIC isn't the word for word copy of the conversation, but a subjective memory of it. The nature of SIC is information and communication.<br/><br/>As you can see there are real world powers that are interlinked with these three powers of the player's mind: the rulesbook, the in-game conversation and (wich I didn't mention) the social contract. The rulesbook is a static thing that provides the REG for the players, the conversation is the dynamic genesis of the SIC and the social contract is the arena where the interests of the individuums conflict. (Sidenote: the power itself of these "powers" (better term wanted) comes from a kind of covert social contract, for example: "If I paid that much for a book I won't start right out playing a complete different game.", but it is a subject of later examination.)<br/><br/>The most important thing defining the links that these definitions mustn't be arbitary, the because the links themselves aren't anything else than the effect of the 3 powers. For now I am assuming that the links have these definitions, but I'm open to any suggestions:<br/><br/>I -&gt; S = The individuum changes the SIC. It is easy to define this in a classic role-playing game, where most of the players have a tool for this maneuver, their character. The PCs actions are all this type of links, but not exclusively. It can be making up contacts or the whole work of the GM. (If you have a GM.)<br/><br/>S -&gt; I = The player makes a decision based upon the SIC. The individuum is influenced by the shared content. Sure, it is very tightly close to the other direction.<br/><br/>S -&gt; R = The rules are "tweaked" for the sace of the coherence of the world. This doesn't have to be overt (but it can be). For example when the GM doesn't ask you to roll the dice for az unimportant task, when the rulesbook would ask you. This happens often in strongly simulationist games, when the action is not that important in the aspect of dramatics.<br/><br/>R -&gt; S = The player assumes that something is acting in the world as in the rulesbook. Beware: this can be mistaken. For example: the players mostly assume that the spells in the rulesbook is all the spells in the world, but they aren't. It doesn't include when rolling for attack, but it includes when the player assumes that an NPC has a player class etc. The "Purists for System" are full of this. Don't forget, that the REG contains the world description in the rulesbook. This link is happening when the setting of an RPG influences the in-game happenings, too.<br/><br/>R -&gt; I = A rule changes the decision of a player. The player makes a decision based upon a rule. (Important: the REGs include world descriptions. Example: The player makesa  decision considering that here-and-there should be this-and-that stated in the rulesbook and not in the in-game conversation.)<br/><br/>I -&gt; R = The rules grant a possibility for the player, the player is using it. The rules state that if you attack, you can throw the dice and make some damage. When leveling up you can decide wich attributes are raising. This is the payoff of R-&gt;I.<br/><br/>I still work on the links with the three real world things (social contract, rulesbook and in-game conversation), but I already made some discoveries. It is not enough if the rulesbook does have links (or stumps as another theroizing guy called them) towards the imagined world and the players. The book, I mean the document itself has to hav links towards the REG, wich means it has to consider how the players are going to "memorize" the rules. This means an editor can fully ruin a role-playing experience. It is just as much important like as a schoolbook.<br/><br/>The other thing is: the I -&gt; * links has to be approved by the other players or can cause trouble. It is not neccessary, but I think much trouble comes from unapproved I -&gt; * links.<br/><br/>I still state that those decisionmakings and behaviors that Ron Edwards described as Gamism, Narrativism and Simulationism are coming from that the player thinks one pair of the links more important than the others and try to make the others more like those pair. (This is not the restatement of Ron's GNS essay.) The Gamist prioritises the R - I links, the Simulationist the R - S links, the Narrativist the I - S links. For further explanaiton the subtypes of the links should be introduced and I'm not there yet.<br/><br/>I hope this is much clearer than the first draft was.<br/><br/>Gabor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lev_lafayette" title="lev_lafayette"><img alt="lev_lafayette" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lev_lafayette">lev_lafayette</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58648/#Comment_58648" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T02:54:06+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  2:54AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a handy visual representation of the emphasis of the three modes of design.

I'm not a fan of GNS discussion (to use the koan, "I used the ladder, I don't feel like carrying it all over the place after that"), especially not here unless folks start describing realistic situations and the like.<br/><br/>But I think more than "we're past that", it's more like, "Don't think it's the end-all be-all. It's old, full of holes, leaky, not as important as everyone claims it to be, and probably doesn't work right anymore*". Plus, in Mike's case, I think it was tied to an invitation to create something new that, while it didn't really mesh with the whole GNS crap, has some interesting things to say in its own right.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* am I projecting?

Please don't talk here about GNS. I think I made a mistake with the title, but now it's too late. My model is not GNS. Its inspiration is from GNS, and I think I discovered things that were described in Ron Edwards's essays on the topic of GNS. I don't want to make those discoveries again, I don't want to go back. I would like to have a model that works for me and for most of the people. That is: it would make designing and playing easier by making it more transparent.<br/><br/>In short: yes, GNS is old, thatswhy I try a new model.
