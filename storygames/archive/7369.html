I sometimes use OAV, but most of the time I use Primetime Adventures.  The ebb and flow of the episodes (anime or even manga), the characters, and the play it produces... I basically call it "<i>The</i>Manga RPG". I really haven't seen other games that can do it better than PTA.<br/></blockquote>\nI've seen you say this before, and I pretty much agree... but I have a question to put to you. I've recently been looking at With Great Power, and it reminds me a great deal of PTA, but with bigger, badder action sequences. What do you think of WGP's potential for anime/manga stories? In particular, things like Sailor Moon...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163927/#Comment_163927" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T21:35:51+00:00" title="August 20, 2008  9:35PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm. Here's the thing about WGP: The conflicts have to be able to escalate back and forth from talking to punching. If you can think of four ways conflict can can exist in Sailor Moon (I haven't seen the series, so I don't know), then it might work. But I tend to see that once a fight starts in an anime or manga, it rarely drifts to another mode of conflict. So it might be hard.<br/><br/>Like, if I were doing "Blade of the Immortal", I might use "fearsome words/shouting", "weapon attacks", "manuvering" and "..." (something else, I can't think of anything now). That might work. But it also might make things messy. Haven't tried.<br/><br/>If I were doing Revolutionary Girl Utena, I'd use "social", "willpower/psychology", "status", and "martial"... but the thing is, in Utena it never escalates through one or two of these. It would produce really weird effects, I think.<br/><br/>So in my opinion, it might be a hard conversion. You can give it a shot, though. The "dude gets ass kicked, then comes back for more" is definitely similar to anime and manga story arcs, but beyond that I think you'll have a hard time deciding what the suits should be in a conflict.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163930/#Comment_163930" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T22:05:38+00:00" title="August 20, 2008 10:05PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm quite fond of both Prime Time Adventures and With Great Power... Either one could be used for a good anime game, but With Great Power... specifically invokes the kind of feeling you only get from really, really violent animes... and comic books, of course.<br/><br/>If you like animes and manga like Fist of the North Star or even moodier episodes of Ranma 1/2, then your group will probably find With Great Power... to their liking. Otherwise, I'd stick with Prime Time Adventures. It supports a wider ranger of emotions and problem solving than With Great Power...

You need to have, at any time, the option of at least 4 "different actions" to go along with the suits. But you're right, you could use them for 4 different social things like "being nice; being mean; appealing to status; appealing to friendship". However, it's good to remember that the core of WGP is that it expected to keep those ranges open as much as possible: In other words, that you could talk to the enemy in one frame, and throw a bus at them in the next. To pull that back and make 4 different shades of the same kind of activity (phsyical, social, etc)... well, it probably CAN be done. But it might be complicated. And one has no leg to stand on with blaming WGP if such a hack fails.<br/><br/>It might be worth giving a shot, though.

Hmmmm.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Oh, I wasn't even talking about making as significant a change as that, although it seems possible. It's more that I can see a lot of flexibility in five of the options the book presents... Persuasion/threatening/gloating, Dodge/Maneuver, Punching/Striking/Kicking, Weapons/Objects, and Use a Power all fit pretty well into most shojo/shonen fights, I would think. (Although, I'm not actually a big anime person... that's more my wife's deal. Which is actually why I'm asking. She's a big Sailor Moon fan.)<br/><br/>I do think that PTA would be a nice, simple choice. It might click better with the way that scenes play out, and it's quite obvious from the few Sailor Moon episodes I've seen that each of the girls has an Issue...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164024/#Comment_164024" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T09:05:59+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  9:05AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2008 9:06AM by Eric.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Like, if I were doing "Blade of the Immortal", I might use "fearsome words/shouting", "weapon attacks", "manuvering" and "..."

Makie goes from fighting to talking about her childhood. Anotsu goes from fighting to talking about... lots of stuff, mostly philosophy and whatever else is on his mind at the time, usually to good effect on his opponent.
