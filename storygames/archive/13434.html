Narrativa is boxing Jeepform games and making elaborate hand-crafted books for Dogs and My Life With Master.<br/><br/>It's a crafty revolution, and I want y'all to share your wisdom. <br/><br/>What are the limits to Etsy-sanctioned merch? How can Etsy sites cross-promote? <br/><br/>Where do you get set-up boxes, what's the unit cost, and how are they received by players?<br/><br/>What does a personal touch add in value and in cost?

We don't have any experience selling game products this way, though. (I'm considering having her make a couple of hand-bound volumes of projects I release next year, but carts and horses, there.) She sells <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/repaper" rel="nofollow">handmade books</a> (including books made from board games). <br/><br/>If you haven't, you should look at, and maybe get in touch with, Eric Torres of Rynada Design.

Etsy sites can promote each other, and there's groups on Etsy called Teams that you can form to do just that (for example: Etsy Metals is a Team that lists sellers on Etsy who work specifically with handforged metal. It's a juried team, which means you have to meet certain criteria to join, but its member run). <br/><br/>Etsy primarily focuses on handmade merchandise, but you can also sell bits and pieces that people can use in their handmade merchandise (like feathers or beads) and recyclable objects and goods (like thrifted and vintage clothing). There's rules and guidelines, but mostly its cheap, easy, and a great place to sell things. I've not had much luck selling my jewelry on there, but then, I haven't busted my ass trying to promote it either.<br/><br/>In any case, those are the basics. Make more pretty handmade RPGs and sell them on Etsy please!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302833/#Comment_302833" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T11:29:17+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 11:29AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2010 11:36AM by Graham.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found hand-made things sell wonderfully at conventions, where people are looking for something different. <br/><br/>There is a lot of labour involved, but profit margins are large. For example, my special editions of The Rending Box took a day to put together. I sold 20 of them for \xa310 each. The raw materials for each cost me about \xa31.50.<br/><br/>With a long-armed stapler, a home printer and a bit of imagination, you can create good-looking booklets cheaply. I also use an old-fashioned guillotine to trim paper to size, but that's not always necessary.<br/><br/>Here are some photographs of The Rending Box. They are paper booklets in a rigid box (which cost 70p each for a batch of 100). The symbol on the top is spraypainted: a really quick and fun process.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://catchyourhare.com/images/Rending%20Box%201.JPG" width="400"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://catchyourhare.com/images/Rending%20Box%202.JPG" width="400"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://catchyourhare.com/images/Rending%20Box%203.JPG" width="400"/><br/><br/>And here is a photograph, by Paul of Cthulhu, of the stuff he got at Dragonmeet. You can see The Rending Box there, as well as Cthulhu Apocalypse, another thing of mine. (Cthulhu Apocalypse consists of four booklets, each longer than the next, so that all the titles show when they're stacked together.)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.yog-sothoth.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1045&amp;d=1290975857" width="600"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302836/#Comment_302836" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T11:34:22+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 11:34AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2010 5:49PM by mease19.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a cool product would be game-specific dust jackets, slip covers, and book boxes.

My family got by on food stamps and things we made and sold at Portland's Saturday Market for a time so I'm sure that has something to do with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303035/#Comment_303035" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-03T05:23:20+00:00" title="December  3, 2010  5:23AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can get rigid set up boxes at Uline.

I'll confess that my efforts in the handcrafting arena are still in the early stages. There's exactly one thing that I know how to make: my book, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/62929278/the-dreaming-crucible" rel="nofollow">The Dreaming Crucible</a>, and I learned how to do it in the process of doing it. Some of the skills I acquired are surely transferable as I tackle other projects, but it's still rather early for me to talk broadly about crafting.<br/><br/>So I'll talk narrowly about it! The Dreaming Crucible with interior pages of Ivory colored <a href="http://www.southworth.com/page.php?id=26" rel="nofollow">Fine Granite Paper</a> from Southworth, printed half-letter size on my Epson Stylus inkjet printer. I assembled the covers from cardstock, color illustration printed on photo paper, and colored matte paper to frame it, all pasted together with scrapbook glue to make a nice layered effect. Then I sewed the books together with colored embroidery thread in lieu of stapling. It's called a pamphlet stitch and holds the books tightly together with just three puncture points and a simple knot, and looks pretty while doing it! I learned it from some nice ladies at the <a href="http://pdxzines.com/" rel="nofollow">Portland Zine Symposium</a> last August as I cruised the hall looking for zinemaking techniques to put to use.<br/><br/>And here's the result:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ny-image1.etsy.com/il_570xN.196708293.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ny-image1.etsy.com/il_570xN.196708325.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ny-image1.etsy.com/il_570xN.196708361.jpg"/><br/><br/>I'd say the keys to making this work were:\n<ul>\n<li><i>Do things that professional printing CAN'T do</i>. To make my book special without a glossy cover and perfect binding, I had to think of ways to say "handcrafted is an <i>asset</i>, not an excuse." The sewn binding and layered illustration framing of the cover are nice aesthetic touches that turn a book from something you just ran off on your printer to an object of beauty.</li>\n<li><i>Do all the professional things you CAN do.</i> Like I said, I didn't want homemade to be, like, a free pass to make a shoddy book. So I secured permission to use the <a href="http://bluefooted.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">gorgeous artwork</a> of Erin Kelso, whose pieces just <i>scream</i> Dreaming Crucible. And I learned the typesetting ropes in Adobe InDesign, working closely with Joe McDaldno and Mike Sugarbaker, and soaking up tips from others suck as Brennen Reece. As a result I've got a book I'm happy to look at and proud to show others.</li>\n<li><i>Cruise for techniques constantly.</i> As soon as I set out to make my own books, I suddenly got very into zines in general. I attend the aforementioned Zine Symposium every year, and I haunt stores like <a href="http://www.guapocomicsandbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">Guapo Comics</a> and <a href="http://www.readingfrenzy.com/about/" rel="nofollow">Reading Frenzy</a> around town where self-prodiced comics and books are sold. I do it because i love the zines, but I've also got an eye out for different techniques and processes that I might want to use, such as the pamphlet stitch I used on the Crucible. I've got my eye on screenprinting and letterpress, for instance. I'd love to learn some more papercraft to so I can do books with more individuality to their look and feel. I haven't yet joined the <a href="http://www.iprc.org/" rel="nofollow">Independent Resource Publishing Center</a>, but I really should as soon as possible as they offer all kinds of classes in this stuff.</li></ul>\nSo, I'm happy with that whole process.<br/><br/>Now, on the business side of things, I don't think I've found a way to make Etsy work for me, just yet. And it may just be that Etsy <i>doesn't</i> "work for" people the way, say, Ebay does. People come to Ebay to find stuff to buy, as well as sell. People come to Etsy, I'm thinking, mainly to sell their own stuff. They then direct traffic to their Etsy listings through their own sites and so forth. Since listing on Etsy, I've sold two books there, and both of them to folks in the Story-Games community who found their way there through my mentions here or on Twitter. And that's great--thank you, both of you; I hope you enjoy reading and playing, and would love to hear about your experience! But honestly, I already have an Un-store listing. If Etsy is going to do anything special for me, I'm going to have to figure out how to draw traffic from people who don't know about the game, as opposed to you folks who I already have access to.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303870/#Comment_303870" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T04:47:59+00:00" title="December 10, 2010  4:47AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hand sewn books are definitely doable and make a vastly superior binding to perfect binding.

I have a shop set up and I plan to start selling art and prints quite soon. Games may follow, but that idea is still in its infancy. <br/><br/>Etsy teams are kind of a big deal. Sharing tips and ideas and talking to people is a big deal. Like the indie gaming crowd, your fellow sellers are your fans are your best customers. I think a team of gamer-friendly Etsy shops might be a fantastic idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304528/#Comment_304528" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T07:55:21+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  7:55AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note also that Etsy has an <a href="http://www.etsy.com/alchemy/" rel="nofollow">Alchemy</a> section where you can make requests for particular items and crafters can place bids to make those items.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
