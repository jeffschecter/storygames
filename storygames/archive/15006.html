Even better, pre-registration prices are staying the same as last year. Think of it as getting an extra day for FREE. GASPcon runs 24hrs a day from opening till close. We always have a great selection of Indie RPGs, a massive board game libray, and even a few mini games if that is your thing.<br/><br/>We are now accepting GM event submissions.
