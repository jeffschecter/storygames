The elders spoke about the litany last night.  I didn\u2019t pay much attention, it really wasn\u2019t a message for me, you know.  A lot about our tradition, our pride, but what they really meant was the Silver Fang\u2019s tradition.  I did like you told me, I just shut up and nodded when they spoke.  Much happened that I can\u2019t remember but strange smells or ginger and motor oil still linger from the moot.  If I did not know better I\u2019d say the sept was trying to drug us, but more likely the presence of all those spirits mixed with our senses.  I\u2019m still not familiar as many with the umbra. It\u2019s another world, one I don\u2019t have any burning desire to explore. <br/><br/>The elders did their rites; they branded our bitch asses and called us a questing pack.  Can you remind me what that shit means?  I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve heard the name but I think I was trying to bum some food off a trick when you told me.  So, fuck it, we\u2019re a pack now, a big one too, that is good because it will be easier to let the high mucky mucks sort out the politics, leaving me plenty of room to bring up the rear. <br/><br/>Some good people, or wolves or garou or whatever we\u2019re supposed to call each other.  I knew I was going to piss them off though, so I thought I\u2019d do it right from the start.  Yeah, I did.  It worked.  I told my new pack that all the \u201cfamily\u201d I had ever known were rapist pieces of shit.  So this big wolf, a huge fucker with balls the size of cantaloupes I\u2019m sure, gets in my face.  I look at him. Yeah he\u2019s a Get of Fenris, he\u2019s going to want a fight.  It didn\u2019t take much to piss him off either, so we tussled.  Did I mention he was a huge fucker?  Yeah we went quickly to blood, biting and clawing, he stayed in wolf form, which like I said has got to mean he\u2019s either the ugliest fucking crinos you\u2019ve seen, or yeah\u2026 huge brass. <br/><br/>He wants me to back down, take back what I said about family, but I can give as good as I get.  I tell him that we resolve this the old fashion way,  We have a ball kicking contest and the last one standing wins, but the I forgot he was born a wolf, still doesn\u2019t get the pink part of being a werewolf, so he just tries to bite at my jewels. Yeah, we fight some more, good fun, but I really had to hold back and not get vicious.  The more we rolled around the more I wanted to bash his head into a rock and leave him bloodied all over the caern floor. But the people don\u2019t kill each other right?  I think he knew it too, we were both holding back. <br/><br/>Finally the Silver Fang speaks.  Her name is Sonya and she seems very hoity toity.  Raised in the upper crust.  She looked refined, the kind that would piss on me before letting me mount her.   She breaks up the fight, tells us to be civilized, which sounds crazy to Iron Fur and I.  Yeah, the Get is called Iron Fur, I don\u2019t know why yet, but it sounds like a cool name.  Fur and I look at her then we look at each other.  I whisper to him \u201cDon\u2019t try to make sense of it man.  All those Silver Fangs are crazy fuckers, just nod and agree.\u201d  We broke off, licked our wounds started mingling with the rest of the group. <br/><br/>Iron starts telling the other wolf born about human things, like TV. They\u2019re all fascinated and shit, and I\u2019m totally bored so I meander over to his Glass Walker named Worm.  Yeah, that\u2019s his name, with an \u201co\u201d not a \u201cy\u201d.  I guess he was some hacker from the city.  The sept all wants to call him Hacks-the-Worm or some shit, but I say call yourself whatever you want.  I know my pack mate isn\u2019t tainted just because of his name, anyone who can\u2019t figure that out should go fucking fuck themselves for being so stupid.  Anyway this kid Worm and I couldn\u2019t be further apart.  He was rich mucky muck, now he\u2019s got shit.  I had shit, now\u2026 wait I still got shit.  Anyway, he\u2019s never had a temper and I\u2019ve always had one.  I figured we can learn a little form each other, plus he didn\u2019t try to buy me off or use me like you said the glassies would.  He\u2019s cool, I think we\u2019ll tool around the streets together some time. <br/><br/>Then suddenly, we\u2019 got this Alpha!  I don\u2019t even know how it happened, not that it would matter much, who the fuck cares what the Gnawers have to say right? Everyone is looking at him, hearing about his penthouse and he seems like he\u2019ll provide for the pack.  Okay, sounds good enough, but personally I wanted to see more blood on my alpha\u2019s claws.  How can we really know if he can cut it, if he can\u2019t keep us down in a muzzle lock?  I guess we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re still young yet. <br/><br/>Then my nose started acting up again.  Funky shit in the air. Spirits were forming around us, trying to manifest, one in particular, very hazy but also very present, would take the form of our totem.  Some details need to be sorted out first.  We did this weird meld of minds, like we all concentrated really hard and the spirit started taking shape.  We couldn\u2019t figure out who we were calling for the longest time.  I really wanted Coyote.  That fucker is funny, and cunning and you know, I know we\u2019re going to get shit on all the time anyway, so why not?  But fuck, that wasn\u2019t happening, so I think, oh, lets find a wise totem to give us some guidance, the Monkey King is cool,  That fucker knows all kinds of tricks and wants us to preserve freedom, fuck yeah.  I like him, but no, just like always we Gnawers get no love.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner" title="Sean Nittner"><img alt="Sean Nittner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner">Sean Nittner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171312/#Comment_171312" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T14:11:25+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  2:11PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...continued <br/><br/>So it comes down to war\u2026 we\u2019re going to get some totem that will help us rip our foes to pieces\u2026 I\u2019ve got to say, I\u2019m not sorry about that, I like tearing shit up.  So we\u2019ve got Weasel, Wolverine and Crocodile all being called, but none being called strong enough.  We focus, and I get the feeling the spirits like me more than some of the others. Maybe because I was born on the full moon, or because I like to fuck shit up, but my pull matters something.  We get down to Wolverine and Crocodile and I think that fucking lizard is going to take it so I pull a run around and drag Weasel back into the mix and he sweeps us, taking all the energy form us and giving his own to make this bond where we hear each other through him.  Someone said \u201cWeasel net\u201d but it was one of those computer types so it some internet joke or something, fuck if I know. <br/><br/>And, yeah, that\u2019s it Pie Face.  Our pack is formed.  We\u2019ve got a whole ass ton of wolves and that is good because if there is anything better than one crinos tearing shit up, it\u2019s a whole mess of them. <br/><br/>Francois <br/><br/>P.S. How do you think Trash-Can-Fashion sounds? It\u2019s kind of long I think.  Need something shorter to sum it up.  I\u2019m thinking on it man, but you already took Pie Face, so I gotta work with what I\u2019ve got.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
