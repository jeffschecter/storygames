You play with a big group in a park or a large room. You are not allowed to talk back to the handler because that would blow your cover, so you can only hear the handler's instructions. Each playlist has set of short instructions, spoken by each player's handler. The playlist is set to random.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure how to make a game out of that, but it's an amusing thought. Depending on the audio quality, there may be less overhead than producing physical props. You can sell the game on iTunes. You can use the album art for visual aides. You can produce expansion albums, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213711/#Comment_213711" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T08:42:12+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  8:42AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was hoping to design a game as an audio file for Jason Morningstar's Aeromachine contest, but he said that was no good, so I made a board game about eating candy instead (which was also not submitted, so whatever). I feel like it'd like to design a couple short, contest-style games in this format to explore a few possibilities before trying to do something really serious and/or commercial, but I've definitely thought about it.  Designing for a video format is also only marginally more difficult right now, so that could be another option.<br/><br/>One of the things I really want to do at some point is design a game as an album, with multiple tracks.  Some tracks would be background music to play during some sections of the game and some tracks would be instructional or examples.  And then the booklet that comes with the CD (or as a PDF for electronic distribution) also contains some information, making it a multimedia endeavor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213719/#Comment_213719" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T09:59:17+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  9:59AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The classic example is murder mysteries, where each stage of the mystery, and the choices you need to make, are revealed by the next bit of tape.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I'll have to think.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213720/#Comment_213720" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T10:19:43+00:00" title="June 21, 2009 10:19AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the flexibility of digital music files opens different options than you have in a linear format like tape or even CDs.

I can brainstorm a bit:<br/><br/>* Everyone's got a cell phone with texting, yah? And everyone's got either an MP3 player or a phone that does it, ya? So that gives you a "reference" (the MP3s) and a "communication tool." That's a BIG part of making any kind of story game. And, of course, I'm speaking of a LARP game (or at least a kinetic game, not sitting around a table).<br/><br/>* The spy idea rocks. What makes it rock is the one-way instructions. But I add texting. Y'all know you can setup a server to, for instance, return a random number if you text it, right? THAT"s got legs.<br/><br/>* So we have procedures and reference, in the form of audio, and we have a tool for not only interacting with other players (whose numbers we know) but also with a digital interface or the GM (another player, maybe an expert system running a decision tree?).<br/><br/>* I'm thinking of The Assassin Game, now. But it's too simple--action without acting, pretty much only one interaction (killing) with one significant person at a time (the target), unless team vs team (a variant). So maybe, instead, it's more like one to target and one to protect, and the (randomized?) "Character Playlist" tells you who you'll be and who you'll want to protect. Up to you to justify why, when you find and first talk with your dependent.<br/><br/>* Might could end up with huge chains of dependency, as A protects B who protect C who protects D... whom A is told to eliminate. Two separate playlists would mitigate that, and the players choose whether to be an assassin or a dependent by choosing which playlist they listen to (i.e. if I'm an assassin, I randomize my character from the Assassin Character Playlist, and my dependent from the Dependent CPL. Of course, this means the number of assassins and dependents needs to be equal, and the players must reject any randomized Dependent character greater than the number of Dependent players.<br/><br/>* Hmmm... OK, that's a bit broken, but this is brainstorming. I guess the best I can add to a thread like this (without writing a monster essay post no one will read) is to say:<br/><br/>MP3 = Instructional Tool and potential Situation and Character Randomizer<br/>Texting = Way for players to coordinate and communicate. Also a possible connection to a high-functionality chat tool server.<br/><br/>This could be a HUGE LARP/ARG tool, you know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214590/#Comment_214590" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T12:55:59+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 12:55PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had an idea of a Titanic game once. You'd have a CD that starts with harbor sounds (waves, people, seagulls, boaty sounds) and then goes over to classical music. Towards the end there's a big crash and then screams, metal groaning and water rushing in. Then a quiet, calm and sad song.<br/><br/>Obviously, the start is as the ship gets ready to sail, during which you have intro. Then the main part with the period music you play a game as usual, with the conflicts centering around giving and taking tokens, like in M\xfcnchausen (so you win tokens by losing the conflict). And the crash is of course the endgame starting. You can still have conflicts, but every time there's a scream on the tape, everyone has to discard a token. If you don't have any left, you die. Naturally, there aren't enough tokens for everyone to survive ... Then there's an epilogue for the survivors in the calm final section of the game.<br/><br/>So, like, that's something you could do. But I had to do this other game, and making the CD was a bitch, so the thing never got going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214595/#Comment_214595" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T14:22:12+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  2:22PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh crap, Simon.
