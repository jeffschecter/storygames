Here's what I have for Indie Games Explosion thus far.<br/><br/>Black Cadillacs - Friday and Saturday from 2pm - 6pm<br/>Dirty Secrets - Friday and Saturday from 10am - 2pm<br/>Fae Noir - Friday from 10am - 6pm (2 sessions)<br/><br/>Malcolm Craig entered a bunch of his own stuff.<br/><br/>I've had interest in the following games but haven't got enough information to put in an event submission.<br/><br/><b>Candy Creeps</b> - I'd enter this game but I don't have an event description.  I'd just put in the description of the game but I can't find any information on it.<br/><b>Geiger Counter</b> - I'd enter this game but I don't have an event description.  I'd just put in the description of the game but I can't find any information on it.<br/><b>108 Bravos of Mount Lang</b> - I'd enter this game but I don't have an event description.  I'd just put in the description of the game but I can't find any information on it.<br/><b>Shab al-hiri Roach</b> - No one has stepped forward to run this.<br/><b>Grey Ranks </b>- No one has stepped forward to run this.<br/><b>Spirit of the Century</b> - No one has stepped forward to run this.<br/><b>Sorcerer </b>- No one has stepped forward to run this.<br/><br/>It isn't necessary for me to enter the event information in for you.  If you sign up at the GenCon site you can enter the Event yourself.  Just put "Indie Games Explosion" in the Gaming Group/Sponsor field if you want to be associated with IGE and be placed in the same area as the rest of the Indie games.  If you want me to enter the Event you need to get me the following information by Thursday.  I'm closing shop then.<br/><br/>1.) Your name.<br/>2.) Name of your game.<br/>3.) Nameo of the scenario if you want it to be different from the name of the game.<br/>4.) When you want to run it.  I can choose for you but you need to give me general parameters.<br/>5.) A blurb about your scenario.  If this hasn't been completely decided yet, give me a blurb about the system.<br/><br/>That should do it really.<br/><br/>On a slightly different topic.  I have finished putting in Games on Demand.  It will be running Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 10am to 6pm.  I've not scheduled it before 10am because my understanding is that it is hard to get Table Custodians for anything earlier than 10am.  I've not scheduled it after 6pm because most of the Indie crowd seems to want to go over to the Embassy Suites after the Hall of Capitalistic Goodness closes.  So, I have 2 slots of 4 hours each for 3 days.  I need 2 Table Custodians (at least) to cover each of those slots.  If you can help out, send me an email (aecooper AT musfiber DOT com).  Let me know what times and days you want to cover in your email.  Thanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135327/#Comment_135327" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T05:50:01+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  5:50AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I put my own events in not exactly keeping up on the IGE plans.

Here are my reasons:<br/><br/>1) people had no time to get things together.<br/>(because at this point, GenCon is a mirage on the horizon, and not *real* for me yet. Even though I'm going. And planning on releasing a book)<br/>2) people had already submitted their events.<br/>(I'm submitting a few events independently of IGE, as they don't really coincide)<br/>3) the indie scene in general is getting more dispersed and there's less of a sense of collective "let's put on a show" (a.k.a. the awkward adolescence of indie gaming).<br/>Yes, Yes, and Double Yes. I'm not all "Hah, I turn my back on you, Scene!", and I'm totally wrapped up in attending/helping out at G.O.D, but at this point... I dunno, IGE kinda feels like a "Who's friends with The Forge?" event. Which is cool and all, but I dunno... the diaspora is strong, we're blowing apart, and recently I'm seeing less and less the differences in games in general, from Dead Inside to In Harm's Way to Red Box Hack to Roma Imperious to Burning Empires, other than how close or far away they are to a development ideology. I don't really care anymore where the games come from; rather I stand by the ones I like, and spend more time playing than organizing a collective in regards to them. This is neither a here nor there conversation, and I feel bad for bringing it up in the thread promoting the event (I certainly don't want to *sabotage* IGE), but Jonathan's reasons resonated with me, in a way that I wanted to share them with Andrew, because it's totally not his fault.<br/><br/>Games On Demand, on the other hand, is something that I would unhesitatingly dump time and money into helping promote, almost as if I were a partner in the event's success. Last year what did I see? Reign. HeroQuest. *The Fantasy Trip*. Dread. Your Favorite Small Press Game. Playtests. Heck, a group of folks (all friends with each other) unaffiliated with the event even grabbed a table and played a long game of D&amp;D (we were thinking of kicking them, but I voted against it because at the time other tables were open; if there wasn't enough space for the custodians to run games, then yeah I would have asked them to play somewhere else, but luckily it wasn't like that at that time, and there was smiles all around). (EDIT: I was just thinking about it a little: I'm totally cool with people running whatever, even AD&amp;D1e, at GoD, but the thing here was that a group of 6 friends, completely locked in, grabbed a table to play a game by themselves. It would have been the same problem if someone quietly grabbed a table so that six friends could play HeroQuest or Sorcerer, in a way where no one else is invited, no one at the GoD area is allowed to step in, etc. Just to clarify.)<br/><br/>In fact, next year if I go to GC, I'm going to see if we can lock down the Games on Demand area all the way until 10-12PM each night. Embassy Suites is nice and all, but the reason we gamed there was primarily because we had no where else to go at night after a day of running the Forge Booth. Now, with Games on Demand, we totally do have a place to go at night, a place central to the hotels and all, and a place where I'd love to see more people come and split off for random wild shit (oh, I just realized: One drawback is that there is no bar nearby, but one could always thermos in some White Russians :-) ). This year, because of the construction at the event and reduced event space, it's probably not a good year for it. But next year? I'll be pushing hard for a 10am-10pm playspace, even if I have to step in and run it myself! :-)<br/><br/>So yeah, I feel really strongly about making GoD succeed. IGE? I don't see a problem with people just registering their own events, not in a collective. However, I might be missing something (please tell me if I am, because I don't want to just talk shit).<br/><br/>Anyway, that's just my thoughts on what went down, and why we (Andrew) shouldn't worry about it too much.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135679/#Comment_135679" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T09:57:07+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  9:57AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, I totally echo Andy's sentiments that it isn't your fault, but I also think that you still have a few choices:<br/><br/>1) Personally contact all the indie games people you can find, and see if you can get their events transferred over to IGE events or snuck in somehow.  Just because the deadline's passed, that doesn't necessarily mean you should give up.  GenCon's been pretty flexible working with people in the past, because they want everything to be as awesome as possible too.<br/><br/>2) On the other end, bail on having specific IGE events this year.  I'm not advocating it, but it is an option.  I'm on the fence about whether a 14-event IGE thing is even really a thing.  I guess people who enjoyed IGE last year may still keep an eye out for these events, but maybe they'd work just as well as general events?  I don't know.  My GenCon experience is still pretty limited.<br/><br/>3) Stick with what you have and focus on GoD stuff.  Maybe a teeny-tiny IGE thing is fine, I don't know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136832/#Comment_136832" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-28T15:23:49+00:00" title="March 28, 2008  3:23PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What d'ya know.
