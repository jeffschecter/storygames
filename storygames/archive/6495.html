Today's such topic is about the Jonathan Tweet game "Over the Edge", the surreal game with 12 pages of rules and 200 pages of awesome ideas (mostly from Jonathan's on homebrew setting, IIRC).<br/><br/>Anyway, for those of you who played the game, tell me something interesting that happened in a session, be it because of the players, the game itself, the system, etc.<br/><br/>For me, I've ran it once some, damn, nine years ago or so? It was a session at a Camp Zama (Japan) gaming gathering, and it involved mysterious people doing mysterious things... and for the life of me, I can not remember anything about the game experience. At all. Save that one of the players was a guy named Yuji. I forget who the characters were, what they did, the story I set up for them, everything. Drawing a blank. Which sucks as a story, but I figured that some actual Interesting stories and vignettes would cancel out my lame attempt to begin this thread.<br/><br/>Go!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143827/#Comment_143827" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T20:45:40+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  8:45PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Specifics?

That's because it's dull. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeretical? Take a look at Ben's example. The "moral" in this case is boring. Ending a story before it's begun. Heck, ending the game before it's begun. Teddy Roosevelt on a broccodile? Odd. But entertaining as a RPG? Can you recall anything interesting that the PCs did? <br/>\n<br/>\nI gave OtE a whole-hearted try, using my best technique (which wasn't as good then as it is now, admittedly), and it fell down. And that's because all of the strangeness of Al Amarja pretty much acts solely as a distraction to anything like plot. Oh, lots of events happen, very strange ones. But getting those events to center around the PCs in a way that allows for them to create entertaining stories from their responses... <br/>\n<br/>\n...well it's possible to do this in any setting to some extent. But I'd posit that the surreality of Al Amarja pretty much serves to make this more difficult. Yes, it's a great place for being able to pull out a reason to have just about anything happen, and that facilitates play. But trying to work in the Glorious Lords or some other setting element actually pulls your head away from centering things around the characters. The system is ony good insamuch as it gets out of the way. The secrets seem like good flags, but I found them hard to work with. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell that's how it worked out for me, at least. At best, like most others, I can recall some cool bit of mind-screwing storytelling that occured. Like when I played out a scene, having some bizzarrely surreal things happen like one of the PCs melting, only to have the PC having the dream awaken from it to find themselves back in their room. Or getting lost in the airport. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose things are somewhat fun, sure, but ultimately my play was pointless. Players were extremely disengaged. The game fell apart. Fast. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not to say that it's doomed. Simply that running a game of OtE is more than a little problematic as presented. From my experience, at least. I would be even harsher about this, were it not for the fact that I've published a game that's guilty of pretty much the same sins. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143898/#Comment_143898" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T06:49:37+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  6:49AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 6:50AM by Remi.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A transvestite prostitute on the run from her pimp seducing the gunman sent to kill her in a bathroom at the world's most confusing airport.<br/><br/>A calm breakfast after a desperate shootout with shape-shifting aliens.

And back when I started, I had NO technique, so it was even worse. Now I have. . .<i>some</i> technique, and it's still a strain. Even when I made all the action center around PCs' actions, players told me they felt paralyzed by the setting.--"The people behind the assassination attempt I'm investigating are a eons-old conspiracy in the service of mankind's Immortal Masters bred to  inherently command humans? What am I supposed to do with that?!"<br/><br/>That said, a vignette:<br/><br/>A cat and an AWOL Special Forces operative stare each other down in the street: to their mutual astonishment, they are both wearing the same loud hawaiian shirt, straw hat, and huge camera. A passerby (who happens to be a hitman on run) is intrigued by the cat and picks it up. The Cat sais, "I'd like you to put me down now," and the hitman is strangely compelled to do so. When he tries to pick it up again, the hawaiian-shirted spec-ops man whooshes between them with preternatural speed and intones, "I think you'd better leave the cat alone," with a vampiric gleam in his eye.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144065/#Comment_144065" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T17:33:18+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  5:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought OTE solely because I wanted to READ it.

That's totally on for OtE's professed theme of surreal danger and conspiracy.

You don't try to use <i>everything</i> in that big mess of a setting, you just pick one or two things. If the PCs are super weird floating eyeballs and voodoo masters, then you let them be the most weird shit and weave them into the more mundane parts of the city. If they play cops and journalists and junkies, then drop some crazy freaky stuff on them.<br/><br/>Also (just like Talislanta) after one series wraps up, the players will know enough details of the setting to begin playing within their knowledge of it. Someone might choose to play a Glorious Lord or Sommerite and get all tangled up in their stuff.<br/><br/>Having said that, here's my vignette:<br/>One of the PCs, a desperate addict, murders the man who killed his wife, then has the body cremated into ash and cut with heroin.

Everything is fodder for you. I need huge, I-beam girder strength support in play to make my games work even moderately well. It's insensitive to us mortals to say, "Just do it, it'll be fun!" When in practice that's not the case for those that lack your facility with making entertaining play. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalislanta, on the other hand, I have no problems with. Using Hero Quest I'm sure I could make that sort of setting humm. That's because play is all oriented around fantasy premises like "How do these cultures (fail to) get along?" (or I could just run it as Gamism hack n slash). The premises for OtE would have to be developed locally, and mostly on the fly. Apparenlty I don't have the chops to accomplish that. And not for a lack of trying to develop same. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it's the setting that matters. I used HQ to try to run Castle Falkenstein, and had very much the same problems, and that was even bringing to bear most of the technique that I have mastered to date. The setting says, "Really adventurous stuff happens!" and I'm all... "OK, but how do I make that engaging to the players in terms of enabling them to make creative contributions?" <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that your response is probably, "It's easy, you just do it." But you ain't got the dain bramage like I does. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144312/#Comment_144312" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T17:20:17+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  5:20PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm.
