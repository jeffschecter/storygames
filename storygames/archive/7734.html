The reason why it is resonating with me so much is the protagonist driven story interwoven with external complications. In every episode so far, there has been a format that has really worked.  Michael (the protagonist) is trying to discover why he got burned and get it fixed.  This is the protagonist\u2019s core issue.  In each episode he gets another lead, a hint, a clue or something that leads him closer to finding out what happened.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, in each episode either because he needs money, someone he cares about needs help or because he gets suckered into it, he gets some job.  Each show deals with him tackling his primary goal in small ways while focusing on the episode long plot.<br/><br/>When I think about this in terms of role-playing I think it is a great example of the kind of scene framing that could take place between a player and GM.  As the player opens a scene, the player describes their character taking some action towards their goal.  The scene plays out till the conflict is resolved and then the GM frames a scene regarding the session's mini-plot.  The first scene narrated by either is setting the stakes for the rest of the session.<br/><br/>For example in the pilot episode of Burn Notice the protagonist sets the stakes of wanting to contact his handler (the guy who until just recently sent him on assignments) and the GM (for lack of a better term) sets the stake of the mini-plot as to can Michael help a guy who is being wrongly accused of stealing some valuable artwork.<br/><br/>As the story progresses scenes of addressing those two issues are interwoven until the end of the episode where the protagonist has learned a little and found the real thief.   I'd really like to run a game with this format.  PTA is an obvious choice, but if you give players the opportunity to tell you what their character wants to achieve in each session, I think it can be done in any system.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171722/#Comment_171722" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T00:07:02+00:00" title="September 28, 2008 12:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't seen Burn Notice, but Veronica Mars has more or less the exact same structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.Jay" title="C.Jay"><img alt="C.Jay" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.Jay">C.Jay</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171724/#Comment_171724" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T00:21:04+00:00" title="September 28, 2008 12:21AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So does Grand Theft Auto.<br/>\n<br/>\nErm, not a show though, obviously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171729/#Comment_171729" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T01:33:46+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  1:33AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things that struck me about the show is the way Michael puts stress on his assets to get what he wants: for example, Barry the money launderer who mostly does the work that Michael wants but occasionally gets leaned on when Michael wants more than Barry is willing to give. Equally, Michael's mother provides a few basic resources (a place to go, a car, a garage to work in) but being mixed up with Michael's work occasionally puts her in danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nPTA would work fine, with traits being used up as the characters use them more, but maybe instead of a personal set to refresh your traits, you need something more dramatic: a big rescue scene to save your mother from the bad guys, or a big favour to your Barry equivalent in order to get back on his good side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner" title="Sean Nittner"><img alt="Sean Nittner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner">Sean Nittner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171733/#Comment_171733" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T02:17:00+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  2:17AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, I really like this idea, for the genre its appropriate, a resource becomes more prominent in the story, once it has become a real element of the story.  Example as long as his mother is just the annoying mom who will let him hide out in her garage, she's essentially part of the background.  But once she becomes the focus of the story (his mom knows information he needs and holds out until he does what she wants) she becomes real.  <br/><br/>Mechanically speaking, I like the idea of representing that by requiring some risk (your mom might get hurt, Barry could stop doing work for you, Fiona's enemies could find her, Sam's girlfriend could dump him, etc) before allowing those traits to be re-used.  This feels similar to Agon's principle of we only grow through struggle.... and I like that.<br/><br/>cool idea James.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171752/#Comment_171752" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T10:56:56+00:00" title="September 28, 2008 10:56AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the subtitle guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
