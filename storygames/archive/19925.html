This placement shapes their characters stats and what schools of magic they are intuitively stronger with. <br/><br/>I have been playing with the the idea of mapping this graph to the <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6474/personality_and_play_styles_a_.php?print=1" rel="nofollow">Unified Play Styles</a> so that a player is placed on the graph based on their play style instead of personality.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/feature/6474/chart.png"/><br/><br/>Where I see this idea's real potential is the fact that I can give the player powers and rewards that enable and promote their play style. Allowing the game to appeal to all play styles.<br/><br/>E.g <br/><br/>The Explorer/Simulationist play style is often concerned with figuring out a problem, and seeks knowledge and understanding. Players falling into this classification would be intuitively really good at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination" rel="nofollow">Divination</a> magic and are rewarded within the game for asking clever questions, or learning about hidden facts.<br/><br/>The Socializer/Narrativist playstyle is often concerned with cooperation, diplomacy and making everyone happy. Players falling into this classification  would be intuitively better at healing/support magic and would be rewarded for helping others.<br/><br/>My concern comes from the fact that a large portion of these theories [Including <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/1/" rel="nofollow">Ron Edwards GNS</a>] says that any game can only effectively deliver upon 1, or maybe 2 of these play styles. I think sorting players by their play style has the potential to capitalize on the whole spectrum, but am not sure if it would dilute the experience too much.<br/><br/>I am interested to hear what you think, is it possible to effectively appeal to all of the player types within a single tabletop RPG?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440967/#Comment_440967" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-19T15:53:13+00:00" title="December 19, 2014  3:53PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My answer (YMMV) is a definite but qualified YES, with the following caveats:<br/><br/>1.

Also, I think the mapping of Caillois to the other theories, particularly for ilinx and alea, is kind of off. The chart is more convincing when you remove that column.<br/><br/>Returning to the first point, I think that it makes a kind of sense to align in-character powers with play style preferences; where this will affect players' enjoyment is in how those powers interact: e.g., if one player has Killer powers, and another has Socializer powers, to what extent does one player's choice to use his or her powers preempt the other player? "You killed him! Now I can't talk to him!" You see this all the time, and so I'd say you need to think beyond the assignment of powers to how you imagine them working together in play, to the extent that you think that won't just shake out at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440970/#Comment_440970" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-19T16:15:17+00:00" title="December 19, 2014  4:15PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GNS terminology is irrelevant here and has nothing to do with your design conundrum. (Your source here seems to be a superficial pattern-matching exercise that ignores that the different models they treat are often discussing entirely different phenomena.)<br/><br/>Your basic idea is solid, there is no reason why you couldn't match PC super powers with player nature - I've got a game in the works that does exactly this, although I prefer to make the actual matching a creative exercise for the GM.<br/><br/>Because the magic types you're allocating to player characters have to do with problem solving toolsets and literary symbolism of fantasy memes, the actually relevant player categorization for you has to do with either literary themes or problem solving strategies - or both, if both of these are actually significant creative priorities in your game. (I'm characterizing the matter this way because I don't know the specific creative agenda of your game, and therefore I couldn't guess as to which facet of a super power matters for play.)<br/><br/>Probably the best framework for considering problem solving behaviours of players for you is either the Bateman, or Robin's Laws (as I understand them, they cover the same ground with slightly different semantics). The idea in this type of behavioral analysis is to consider the favoured <i>core activity</i> of a player to better provide them with that activity. Because different types of magic can be viewed as different interfaces towards the fictional world, it makes sense to assign them on this basis: the powergamer gets a situational rules-based magic, the setting-oriented player gets divination magic that helps them expose and engage in the lore, the empathetic and passive player gets defensive magics they can use to help the party, and so on.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the main point of having different magics is to differentiate characters and allow for roleplaying opportunities, then it makes sense to go with literary memetics: girls and hippies get healing magic, the Hero gets a magic sword, the witty cynical on-looker gets knowledge magics, and so on. This, again, makes sense if we presume that it is a good thing to create characters that are custom-made for the players to express their most natural behaviours. Much fantasy fiction is created in this way, e.g. the X-Men consistently just "happen" to have ostensibly random powers that reflect their psychological issues and social roles.<br/><br/>As I intimate above, which of these approaches makes more sense for you is strictly a matter of what the magic powers are for, anyway, in the game. If they're for problem-solving, focus on distributing the tools so everybody gets the problem-solving role they most desire; if they're for characterization purposes, distribute them according to social and thematic character roles. If the magic powers are for some other purpose, perhaps there's some even better logical heuristic for you to rely on; the point is that it makes much more sense to recognize the <i>why</i> before attempting the <i>how</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440972/#Comment_440972" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-19T18:29:20+00:00" title="December 19, 2014  6:29PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm an INTP (Myers-Briggs), which is one of the Rational types in your Keirsey column.

The pro and con arguments have gone something like this:\n<blockquote><b>Pro:</b><br/>You can play with your friends naturally, rather than having to (a) recruit strangers who want exactly what you want, or (b) convince your friends to do something that's not their ideal.  Historically, many GMs have successfully tailored their play to individuals, providing drama for one player and puzzles for another.  Many GMs favor "toolbox" systems for this purpose, where the GM has a subsystem at their fingertips for each new call they make on what to confront a player with.  "Here's a Sanity check for you, and an Occultism spend for you, and an Agility check for you, and then you two can just roleplay out your next plan."  Yeah, there's some turn-taking -- player 1 does a thing while everyone else watches and waits, then repeat for player 2 -- but that's true in plenty of tightly-focused RPGs too and is by no means a deal-breaker.<br/><br/><b>Con:</b><br/>Just because a GM can get into drama, then tactics, then world flavor, each in turn, doesn't mean everyone at the table will do likewise.  Whereas waiting for "my turn" in a game that's wall-to-wall drama may have decent odds of exciting players who are there for drama, waiting through some drama and puzzle-solving is less likely to excite a player who is there for action.  The more divergent the player paths, the less likely you are to find constant or universal engagement.  This doesn't render a good time impossible by any means, but it does render a creatively fulfilling unity of shared purpose and mutual appreciation pretty darn unlikely.  To some players, that's not important; to others, that is <i>the</i> most important thing.  Also, for every GM who can successfully pull off the style-hopping, there are many who cannot, or who can but find it too exhausting to enjoy.</blockquote>\nIf you've already thought through all this, then sorry for the spiel.  Perhaps my list of cons can at least serve as trouble-shooting reminders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440975/#Comment_440975" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-20T01:07:12+00:00" title="December 20, 2014  1:07AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense unless the columns are supposed to be independent of each other (i.e. I can be an Artisan and seek "people fun" through desiring skilled, emotionally on point social improvisation, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L" title="Patrick_L"><img alt="Patrick_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/999/nLXZTS67FSGIK.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L">Patrick_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440977/#Comment_440977" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-20T01:41:12+00:00" title="December 20, 2014  1:41AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all of the input guys! <br/><br/>I am still not sure if I should keep the matrix as it is now [Player personality determines arcane capabilities - solely based literary themes] or adapt it so matrix placement depends on play style.

Taking the players' play styles into account, instead of having the players form their play styles around the game is one reason why we got this "20 minutes of fun for a four hours session" statement. I can't really see how a game designer can think like that. I would rather just play those 20 minutes and be done with it.<br/><br/>That said ...<br/><br/>Imagine having three phone calls on the same line. How can we distinguish one from another? One way is to chop up the line into time segments and give each phone call it's own time segment. This is how combat usually works, and it's another reason of why we have "20 minutes of fun...".<br/><br/>Another way to do this is to use different frequencies on the same line that goes parallel to each other. My idea here is if you want to make a game that uses different play styles, let the players play the game in a parallel way at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
