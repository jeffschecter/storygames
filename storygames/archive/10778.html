I'm probably using Risus as the engine since it's so simple and the kids have learned the basics of it. I found a great <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mw/20030605a" rel="nofollow">Canal City</a> map to use as the setting.<br/><br/>I have two requests for ideas/references...<br/><br/>For the culture, I want to do something a bit more modern than the dreaded medieval/elves/orcs fantasy, but I'd like to keep some magic. Steampunk is fun, but I'm thinking of skewing it in a more magical direction ... Keep the overall Victorian style, but steam engines are so finicky, bulky, noxious and tedious to keep running. If magic is available, why not use clockwork instead? Spring steel can be alchemically strengthened to hold more power-per-gram, and kinetic sorcery can tap the energy generated by water-wheels to wind the springs.<br/><br/>I'm sure this has been done \u2014 "steam-and-sorcery" or "clockpunk" or whatever \u2014 but does anyone have specific references I could mine for ideas? Mi\xe9ville's New Crobuzon has a magical-Victorian feel but is way, way darker than what I have in mind.<br/><br/>The other thing is economics. Start with the question: how do you rewind the springs? Lugging everything over to the hydro-power plant is impractical, so let the springs be detachable and sealed inside little boxes, like batteries. (I visualize them as fat discs the size of two or three stacked silver dollars.) When one runs down, you swap it out for a wound one. Unwound springs get taken en masse to the plant to be rewound.<br/><br/>Now: These spring packs are mechanically and magically complex, thus valuable, but can be reused for a long time. And they're portable. So maybe <i>they themselves are currency in this society</i> \u2014 both energy and coins. The alchemists and magicians of the Mint keep the secret of their manufacture, and the Treasury decides how many to keep in circulation, replacing them as they wear out. Poor people only have a couple, and might have to give them up to pay the rent if times get hard, and do everything by hand. Rich people will have a lot and can afford to put ten or twenty of them in a car, with plenty left over as spending money.<br/><br/>But a wound spring has to be worth more than an unwound one, to account for the effort of carrying them to the power plant to recharge, and then back to where they're used, as well as the plant's service fee (for every ten springs you bring in, they recharge nine and take one.) This implies the existence of itinerant clockwork-traders who collect people's unwound springs and replace them with wound ones, as their route takes them to the plant and back. It also implies that, if you're using springs as coins to buy goods, springs with more power are worth more. The seller will hold your payment up to his/her ear to hear the ticking: the faster it ticks the more it's charged.<br/><br/>Where it gets really weird is if you assume that springs, like our rechargeable batteries, gradually discharge even if unused. This means your fresh money loses value over time. It's almost an inflationary effect, except that the value stops at a certain point (the value of an uncharged spring) which is maybe 50% of max. And maybe people mostly use charged springs as motive power instead of currency, only spending the dead ones they pull out of their vehicles.<br/><br/>Anyone got any ideas about this? Again, I can't think of any exact precedent for the idea, although I remember that Larry Niven once proposed radioactive coins, which decay in value over their half-life (and literally burn a hole in your pocket if you carry too many!)<br/><br/>I know most of this will be lost on my kids <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> but once I've had the ideas they're too fun not to run with...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238999/#Comment_238999" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T13:12:39+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  1:12PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the look, I would think <a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com" rel="nofollow">Girl Genius</a> would be very helpful.  It's 50% Steampunk, 50% Clockpunk, 50% Post-Apocalyptic Victorian, and 150% over-the-top Mad Science.

But I don't think they'd lose power that fast -- it'd be more a matter of making sure you don't leave them unspent for years.  Some possible details of interest:<ul>\n<li>Counterfeiting would be a big issue, both with wholly false spring coins and with coins altered to give a higher wind/charge reading than than they really have.</li>\n<li>There would probably be strong laws against altering the wind meters on coins</li>\n<li>There might be non-spring coins too, for smaller denominations.

I guess it's like the old days of the gold/silver standard, when people did actually use gold and silver coins in addition to paper money.<br/><br/>I also had the idea that, sufficiently near the power plant, springs might spontaneously wind themselves up (slowly) from the mana leaking out. So there might be a poor neighborhood around the plant where people live fairly frugally (just scooters) but never have to pay for energy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239039/#Comment_239039" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T20:43:20+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  8:43PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2009 8:43PM by ccreitz.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is, oddly enough, a whole series of stories by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Bacigalupi" rel="nofollow">Paolo Bacigalupi</a> (available for free <a href="http://www.thinkgalactic.org/Bacigalupi-Think_Galactic_Reader.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>) that revolves around an economy of calories expended and springs wound.

Rather, my intent was just to point to some interesting science fiction that makes clockwork part of its speculative apparatus, and which I hoped you might find stimulating. I really like your underlying idea a lot.<br/><br/>The cool part of Bacigalupi's stories is that instead of the springs being an aesthetic choice that the fiction drives toward, as is common in steampunk, they're presented as a natural consequence of the stuff the author cares about (peak oil, "capitalism"). He thought about the value stored in the springs, and came up with some interesting ideas - like, it doesn't really matter who made or wound the spring, but it does matter whether you have documentation for the calories embodied by it, since the agribusiness IP fleet goes around busting people who have been using "pirate calories". If you have stamps for your calories, you are part of the above-ground economy; if you don't, you're a pirate and an outlaw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shadowmourne" title="Shadowmourne"><img alt="Shadowmourne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/130/nQVJZC4DDIYSK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shadowmourne">Shadowmourne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239054/#Comment_239054" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-25T04:52:35+00:00" title="October 25, 2009  4:52AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of suggestions that may or may not fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps some sort of meter on the outside of the spring coin that counts down mechanically as the springs expend power (this means that no one gets 100% of the power of the spring but whose really in a position to complain). These are useful both to let you know how much power is left in a coin and how much it's worth. I'm not sure if the flavour is better or worse than holding coins up to one's ear but it's something to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second is about counterfeiters. Take one part mad scientist/engineer types producing dangerous machines that don't meet safety standards. Mix in one part forgers making their own money or shaving coins - except in this case they're producing their own spring coins. Coins where the springs may or may not be wound as tightly as authorised currency. They may be doing illegal spring tightening. They live on the outskirts of society and can easily fit the niche of the outcast magician/scientist type. They're not shunned by society so much because their ideas are too out there (which they may be) but because they're unbalancing the economy and they refuse to be held to regulations or standards. Not that that stops people visiting them when they can or will do stuff the Mint refuses to do (or do it for cheaper).<br/>\n<br/>\nRich people can also "afford" better metals in their coins perhaps. Ones that don't wear out or lose power as quickly. That certainly seems like something that would be more valuable. They might also wear jewellery made from springs - how wasteful and extravagant!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know how expansive you want this to go (one city, country, the world?) but spring coins do interesting things to exchange rates as well - if one assumes a standardised size for coins (which they'd have to be, I'd reckon) then are they standardised internationally? Our own plug sockets aren't and neither is our currency. So if your toaster/car/lamp runs out of power abroad then you've got a problem because foreign coins just won't work. There's got to be some lucrative trade in that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say I think this idea is most definitely all kinds of awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239057/#Comment_239057" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-25T06:19:37+00:00" title="October 25, 2009  6:19AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're after Victorian steampunk-and-sorcery, there's always Castle Falkenstein, ready to be mined for inspiration.

Since the coins contain the potential energy that makes them valuable, you simply bleed off a portion rather than handing over the entire coin.<br><br>Think of a debit card reader in our world: you slip your card through and the machine deducts an amount of money from your account.  Make a steampunk equivalent.  Little 'credit' machines that are just mechanisms for bleeding off a set amount of energy off an inserted coin, which is stored in a spring in the machine itself (which makes such machines quite valuable at the end of the business day, I might think, unless they're linked to a system that then transfers the energy to a master spring back at the bank or something).<br><br>Heck, I can see most people carrying around a single coin all day, probably a limited amount that they then re-fill as necessary from the bank so they're not carrying too much 'liquid' energy with them at any one time.<br><br>And, as Stuart noted, you're going to be losing a bit of energy from the system all the time through support systems (such as meters), transference costs, but that seems rather the equivalent of our bank fees. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>-d-                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
