I didn't want to hijack that thread, so here we are.<br/><br/>Most of what I've written up so far I've posted on the Arc Dream <i>Godlike</i> forum <a href="http://www.arcdream.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=369&amp;p=1867#p1867" rel="nofollow">here</a>. So if anyone wants to yak about it, or running/playing military themed games in general (which I enjoy a lot) please have a look at that thread to get the gist of what we're doing and come on back.<br/><br/>In short, we've captured all the elements we wanted in this game and we're really rockin' it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
