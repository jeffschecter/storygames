Outside of battles, I'm working on a system of "challenges" where players use skills to overcome obstacles (kinda like Mouse Guard), but with the twist that, for example, a wizard could have an "Elemental Power" skill and make a check on it to, say, use a fire spell to melt a wall of ice. I also want to work out something to mechanically deal with characters' beliefs (and perhaps relationships), since the storylines in those games and anime typically involve Japanese-style melodrama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294985/#Comment_294985" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T12:55:05+00:00" title="September 28, 2010 12:55PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As antithetical as it may be to the genre, hacking Mouse Guard to do FF would be interesting, I think.<br/><br/>I have my own ideas for hacking Old School Hack (in itself a hack of Red Box Hack) and adding in Conditions like Berserk and Shell and such.

They're both rules-lightish skirmishy games, but SW just seems to bog down so damn hard in any fight with more than four participants.  EoD seems so much breezier and easier.  It also doesn't have the annoying bias towards ranged attacks that basically disallows you from running a melee guy without devoting your entire character build to it.<br/><br/>And yeah, all the random encounter tables and whatnot are interesting, you could practically have an entire procedurally-generated campaign by just rolling up the first session from the initial mission table, following the implications of any random encounters that pop up while traveling to there and back from it, then rolling on the time-lapse table and working from the implications of that.  The TPK consequence table is also great, so killing the entire party is less "well, there goes the campaign" and more "dammit, now we gotta track down those bandits to steal our stuff back."\n<blockquote>I had to get my copy from Clint Krause...
