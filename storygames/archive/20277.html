It's more of a peculiarity of my personal play style and an inside joke than a creative agenda issue. As Peitsa, one of the regulars, says, the reason is likely that I'm often so proactive as a player that my characters simply do more things than the baseline player's - who, even in a particularly active mix of players, is likely to be somewhat of a wall ornament in comparison to the player actually leading the party at a given time.<br/><br/>(I'm sure you've noticed how the old school D&amp;D party has something of a layered structure, with the party caller/leader engaging in active dialogue with the GM, their adjutants adjudicating actively upon their own roles, whatever they be, and the rest of the players largely following the proceedings and interrupting if/when the regular routine does not suffice. It is generally safer to be in the ranks than one of the active operators, unless the active operators specifically assign the dangerous jobs to the ranks, which we generally only do if the operator character itself is somehow especially valuable to the team.)<br/><br/>The other reason besides overall activity is that I tend to hold to a bit of a fatalistic, keen tactical approach in low-level dungeoneering, one where my characters are prone to take one for the team. While some players will stress and worry about the dangers, and invent increasingly micro-managery run-around around common hazards, I tend to think of much of this as a waste of effort and somewhat counter to your tactical purposes in going to the dungeon; the low-level dungeon is a hazardous place, you take your chances with the dice, and generally speaking attrition in the ranks is natural: one of us dies so that the others can get to the treasure, basically. I think it's natural that even if I don't do the trap-springing in a notably stupider fashion than the next guy, the GM will find it easy and clean to execute the most lethal of procedures upon me - they know that I can take it, it's simply more fun than if you're uncertain whether you're ruining a player's fun by doing the (necessary) character-killing when the dice and moves indicate such.<br/><br/>As a concrete example: where some other player would be hesitant to open the door to a new room, or search an unassuming room for minute details, and they might well have some other player's character do it for them, I generally waste little time on hesitation. My characters won't take stupid risks, but they will neither follow a prescribed highly experienced dungeoneering method in an effort to do an end-run around standard hazards - I "roleplay" the character, basically, so they'll learn from their dungeoneering experiences and won't step into the same trap twice, but the new character won't be an expert on their first dungeon trip. So I'll end up being the player who volunteers or outright declares themselves to be the forward scout, who opens all the doors, puts their hands in the dank holes in search of treasure and so on. I well might have an individual character "look up" when entering a room, and similar standard tricks, but ultimately you won't see me swinging some sort of a pole-marmoset-flint knife combo platter in a customized effort to keep my character safe and have forever and ever; danger is dangerous, and few dungeoneers have the luxury of paranoid mentors training them in advance for the life.<br/><br/>(Why won't I use my at this point considerable amassed experience with low-level dungeoneering to optimize every character's individual chances? Mostly because it would combine some slight unrealism with lots of boring, and directly challenge the GM to fine-tune and vary the procedures they use with hazards. While there are theoretically ways to clear traditional low-level dungeons in a nearly zero-risk manner, those are slow and expensive compared to simply having some 1st level nobodies take some personal risks. The resolution rules also assume a certain degree of human frailty from the characters, so if I start playing my characters as perfect machines, I should in fairness also forego many of the various saving throws and such randomized abstractions when those would protect my character; if the character is machine enough to always run a "safe" script, then they're surely machine enough to outright walk into anything that script doesn't cover.)<br/><br/>It is notable that historically the pattern of life and death for my characters changes drastically when the individual character has some special positioning that makes them worth keeping alive over some arbitrary other character in the party. For example, in this last spring's campaign arc, my character Brother Wizzard hijacked the party to return to his home town; he was in many ways crucial to our heist plan, so I wasn't likely to let him be the one who opens new doors or rides in the vanguard on the road. Similarly when Heikki was running Stonehell dungeon for us last year, when I ended up playing a linguist who could understand and talk to the aborogine residents of the dungeon, the party closed ranks around him like a crown jewel - he's been in no particular danger of death from random bad rolls, as he's simply too valuable for the Stonehell crew as a strategic asset.<br/><br/>Of course the "special positioning" can simply be that I like some character a lot and don't want to see them die. Unfortunately, wishing rarely makes it so by itself, but at least I'll limit myself to my fair share of dangerous duties when I'm riding a character I want to see prosper <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>All of the above, I hope, shows how this isn't really a Creative Agenda concern. We do have our Creative Agenda disputes (you remember how I described an old school vs. middle school conflict in the Iron Thomas thread), but I do consider myself part of the hard core of the gamist organic old school set - pretty big part, too, considering how I've basically trained all these other players in the play style. We have a remarkably cohesive creative agenda in general.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446974/#Comment_446974" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-19T08:39:16+00:00" title="July 19, 2015  8:39AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(Why won't I use my at this point considerable amassed experience with low-level dungeoneering to optimize every character's individual chances?

Mostly because if you're actually concerned with realism, the idea of a string of gung-ho, scout characters is pretty absurd. Not in a bad way, but you've blatantly chosen a convenient slice of apparent reality that revolves around expedient personas, so I wonder if realism is actually a part of it. If the resolution of rules assume a certain degree of human frailty, wouldn't that also include highly circumspect or cowardly characters? If you're always choosing personas that suit a desired play style and not the other way around, how do you rectify that with a desire for realism?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446975/#Comment_446975" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-19T09:44:59+00:00" title="July 19, 2015  9:44AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Think of it this way: a player character has already gone through a rigorous psycho-social selection process before they ever sit down to that table in the tavern to wait for an adventure to stumble on their lap. As we regularly acknowledge e.g. while attempting to talk some hapless villagers into becoming henchmen, being an adventurer <i>is</i> a desperate proposition mainly suited for gung-ho personalities willing to act first and think later. The smart guys are trying to talk the local miller into taking them on as an apprentice or something, not planning a delve into a dark place full of bio-hazards based on nothing but some vague rumours about hypothetical treasure. This makes it realistic enough for me to assume that my character might as well be pretty gung-ho.<br/><br/>And of course - <i>of course</i> - I did not say that it would be unrealistic to play a careful character with relevant experience and a head full of stories from other adventurers who knew to warn him to take a 10 foot pole and to always look at the ceiling before stepping into a room. These types of characters are also played commonly around here. I was strictly explaining how my own ephemeral preferences and whims combine with my active attitude towards play, and as a consequence it's pretty often my character who takes the unavoidable saving throw in the face (they're not all avoidable, no matter how much you optimize).<br/><br/>But certainly that is besides the point. Rather more relevant is that I made a mistake in using the word "realistic", which of course has very powerful and specific implications of various sorts to various roleplayers. What I should have said is practically anything I possibly could that would not conjure by this term <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Perhaps I'll rephrase like so: to me the ideal of beautiful and powerful play in an organically developing Gamist game with heavy focus on positioning, such as this style of D&amp;D, is to grasp with determination at a subject matter and challenge proposition that you find compelling; the question is not whether you could win at a GM's obstacle course by stacking rules and positioning to your favour, the question is whether you can triumph against a challenge chosen and internalized by yourself within the fictional constraints, partially unspoken, that determine whether your play is petty or compelling. Not whether you can build a knight that can slay a dragon, but whether <i>a knight</i> as per your understanding of knighthood can slay a dragon.<br/><br/>From this perspective we find that the actual tactical and strategic choices the players make and feel most strongly come about as a combination of two elements that reinforce each other: is what you're doing <i>compelling</i> as a fictional proposition, and is it <i>smart</i> (or effective, equivalently) as a move? In this context the oft-cited D&amp;D attitude of maximizing your effectiveness for the sake of party success is irrelevant, and it is much more relevant to make room for an individual player's character image, the personal constraints they choose for their challenge: this guy wants to pick their moment to betray the party, this one wants to triumph without resorting to underhanded tricks, this one wants to play a naive greenhorn, this one's playing a fatalist who is seeking his own death... All of these can be played in effective ways that are also compelling rather than flimsy in terms of fictive credibility.<br/><br/>I cannot emphasize too much how irrelevant dry nitpicking of rules procedure is to this style of Gamist play as a strategy; not only will you bore other players and raise their ire, but the game has a full panoply of tools to effectively undercut any play the group comes to consider "unrealistic" (there's that word again, but what can I do - that's how the people on the ground; try not to choke on it). This means that not only am I personally uninterested in optimizing at the expense of a robust and compelling fiction, but it is a near certainty that other players would move to e.g. change the rules on me were I to succeed in doing something major, actually important, that goes against the fiction-first principles of play.<br/><br/>All this does not of course mean that the principle of creating adventurer characters would be abandoned; players are still presumed to be creating characters who want to adventure in this particular adventuring party, and pre-existing characters are supposed to be curiously welcome to the idea of adding new faces to the party whenever we have a player without established character. It is natural and effortless to me that we compromise fictional credibility and whatnot regarding matters that are unavoidable given the premise of play, while maintaining and using the fiction as the primary constraint and source of positioning otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446976/#Comment_446976" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-19T09:58:45+00:00" title="July 19, 2015  9:58AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should also clarify about this distinction between gung-ho adventuring and conservative adventuring: I am much, much more likely to go for the latter <i>once the party has the resources for it.</i> It is my genuine belief that a pure baseline 1st level beginning party, with no prior wealth, doesn't gain that much advantage from super-duper careful play; it's quicker and more fun to bite the bullet, pay your dues, get that first adventure over with, and then see what's what once you've got a couple thousand rupees and maybe somebody gets their 2nd level.<br/><br/>What does properly "safe" low-level dungeoneering look like: it involves at least half a dozen armed henchmen, preferably a full dozen; chain mail for front-line fighters; several mantlets custom-built for dungeon environments to provide supremacy in pitched battles; either trained animals or clever machinery to walk in advance of you, to trigger pit traps and such positioning traps; heavy tools for breaking down doors and chests and furniture and weaker walls so as to avoid finesse traps; ideally you also have that wizard with the Sleep spell, but I personally consider that merely a bonus you cannot gain by your own actions, and therefore not something to build upon.<br/><br/>All of the above costs enough in my experience that I won't start planning for it until the first adventure is over with and the party has a few thousand rupees to invest in their second excursion. <i>That</i> one has much better prospects for being run in a professional manner. This makes sense in fictional terms as well: presumably my character will either waste their newly-found wealth, retire upon it (a humble retirement to be sure with mere hundreds of rupees as his share, but that might be enough for some) or invest it in the second venture. In the first case the character is a wastrel who'll continue doing their thing until death comes for them, while in the third case the character is evidently planning a career out of dungeoneering, and will thus grow up rather quickly, managing risks and attempting to turn a profit, avoiding desperate situations.<br/><br/>I guess I felt the need to clarify on this point because it bothered me that somebody here might think that I play <i>badly</i> because I don't know how to go about it for realz. That is not the case, it is merely personal fatalism borne out by experience that causes me to take a pretty relaxed attitude towards the life and death of that new character doing their first adventure, armed with a knife and a staff and a belt to keep their pants up.

I think the use of "realistic" just seemed eerily similar to a sort of supposed immersion that I've known of a lot of players to reference despite stubbornly playing the same persona and using problem solving skills obviously of their own to gain an advantage rather than approaches/skills their characters might believably have.<br/><br/>It seems like what you're talking about is what I'd call <i>consistency</i>. Whether you can say it's realistic or not, the point is that it's consistent with your/your group's expectations. And as easy as that is to name, it's difficult in practical terms. I've been a part of so many games involving players who all read the rule text (and have been exposed to relevant genre pillars) and explicitly discussed expectations, but no matter how much we all appeared to agree with each other, it turns out some of us expected different things.<br/><br/>I've seen paragraph upon paragraph addressing this, ranging from pretty classic, practical discussions about positioning to Big Ass Ideas about how the subtext of rules creates those expectations; but what I keep coming back to is that expectations are almost always going to diverge - often more than we are prepared for. In your case, it appears you navigate this by learning what the rest of your group expects and playing within those bounds. I, personally, think that is a very strong way to play and I tend to have recurring problems with games whose rules are overly concerned with protecting the sovereignty of an individual's contributions <i>from</i> group negotiation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446980/#Comment_446980" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-19T13:40:26+00:00" title="July 19, 2015  1:40PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Players come to a gaming table with essentially random expectations, is my thinking on this. Over time, should they be in the project of developing a campaign in the true long-term sense of the word, they craft and hone the steel of their shared aesthetic truth, and deepen it.<br/><br/>It is very useful to have a dominant player with a vision, plus good co-conspirators, to begin with: the dominant vision can reign, and the others are talented enough to adapt to it. Bonus points if the visions just happen by accident to match.<br/><br/>In our case the current campaign's "roots" in terms of shared culture are in 2012 or so, up in Upper Savo, where we joined together with I think Sipi, Tero and Markku, and probably some other people as well, to play an old school sandbox set in "fantasy Netherlands". Peitsa joined in soon after. Thing is, all of Sipi, Tero and Peitsa had relatively common understanding of historical fantasy from their shared hobbies of Warhammer, boffer larping and being teenagers (well not Tero) with similar cultural exposures. As it happened, my own aesthetics for the campaign latched immediately onto theirs: <i>of course</i> this would be a setting of grand irony, with poor mercenaries spending their last pennies on Hats Greater Than Life; <i>of course</i> poor captains of republican border forts improve upon their poor wages by adventuring (harassing people) on the side; <i>of course</i> those so-called "goblins" are really just some poor declining ethnicity of forest people.<br/><br/>(If all that sounds like LotFP to you, and in case you didn't know from reading earlier discussions: our "historical fantasy" paradigm developed independently of LotFP, but pretty much at the same time as Jim was working on his stuff. It's one of those curious simultaneous parallel developments.)<br/><br/>In this case the original feel of the campaign, with the players aligning their expectations to it, developed through the first say five sessions of play; I think that around the 10th session the players were definitely all singing from the same choirbook, so to speak (of course excepting the fraction that <i>never</i> gets on page due to insufficient cultural literacy - D&amp;D certainly can handle those, no problem). It was quite effortless, and would have been quicker in a game that didn't spend 85% of the time in a dungeon, like that campaign did in the first sessions, naturally enough.<br/><br/>That shared expectation of what's what has proved so robust and appealing that we're still playing it at several tables 500 km distant from the place where it was first articulated, with most players being third-generation heritage of the original run <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446989/#Comment_446989" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-19T23:30:22+00:00" title="July 19, 2015 11:30PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero!<br/><br/>I think you know that I wasn't actually trying to cast aspersions on your gamer cred; I was merely curious how you looked at this issue, and I found your answer quite interesting. (No surprise there!)<br/><br/>My own take on this is that your particular Gamist agenda in this case is simple not so hardcore and so serious that some playfulness wouldn't be allowed. For instance, you can come up with a concept like Iron Thomas - effectively handicapping yourself, at least in some sense - and then play that to the hilt, enjoying the challenges of that particular fictional position.<br/><br/>I think that playing rather rash and gung-ho adventurers gives you a sense of fun in the same way: you're not actively playing to lose or any such thing, but enjoying the challenge which comes along with assuming such a persona for your characters, and embracing it as a high-risk strategy (which may ultimately benefit the party, even if your character happens to snuff it).<br/><br/>If it helps put this in context, one reason I thought of this is because, when I was running my dungeon delve on IRC, we tried to rope you in. However, you refused, saying that your own approach to the dungeon delve (including, for instance, those mantlets) wouldn't jam with the current adventurers delving into the dungeon I had presented (with the implication that you would be either "too effective" or "too boring", possibly). This didn't seem to match your accounts of dead PCs, so I felt curious enough to ask. (Any particular reason you didn't want to join in on that game with a more gung-ho adventurer?)<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to engage my rather silly question with such an in-depth answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447004/#Comment_447004" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T05:59:41+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  5:59AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my own head the Iron Thomas episode doesn't really "count" here. I can see how it would for someone else for whom D&amp;D is D&amp;D and that's all there is to it, but to me it was a distinct sort of game with a distinct creative agenda before we swapped rules systems and rebooted the campaign. As a 5th edition game, whatever the GM's pretensions, the campaign was new school, so I played a new school game with an unique snowflake character - a pretty ironic one, admittedly, but still not one with anything in particular to do with what I'd do in a "serious" old school game.<br/><br/>Aside from that, I think I'm generally pretty clear that whatever our play is, it is not "hardcore" in the sense of being mechanically trivialized into a social clash of rules interpretations between players - you don't get to win things by being more stubborn than the GM, for example, or by knowing the rulebook better. The only "win" being distributed at the table is victories over fictional challenges. In these terms I don't see much fundamental difference between the fictional challenge of fighting a dragon and a fictional challenge of playing a character who doesn't know what a dragon is - those are both constraints, elements of the fiction that are to be accounted for as part of the challenge. The player character is not separate from the scenario the character is in.<br/><br/>Regarding the IRC game, I vaguely remember the adventure you mention, but I don't remember why I didn't want to play. I think it had something to do with wanting to see how you'd run the game, and how the rest of the crew would play it, without my bringing all my then-current baggage about dungeoneering to it. Sometimes it's more interesting to see how others do things rather than insisting on being in the spotlight yourself.<br/><br/>Remember in the first session of the IRC thing, the first character death of the game occurred in the first scene of the adventure: the party of hapless villagers from the Greysands village was investigating the wizards' fort, and I was playing the locally attached priestly type "Flock-Father Ignatius". Poor Ignatius was first off the boat at the fort, and therefore the first to take an attack from the crazy cultist hanging about on the beach. One attack, one hit, one death before the rest of the party closed ranks and struck down the crazy lunatics (I think there was like two or three of them).<br/><br/>That's a very typical Eero death, if I may say so: not particularly dramatic or particularly stupid, just something that happens when you go into dangerous places. Business as usual. Certainly something that could be mitigated <i>if I was playing a different character</i> - in terms of theoretical maximum competence I could have foreseen that there might be danger, I could have maneuvered to put something or someone in between it and myself, and so on. It's not like I the player didn't know that sort of thing was in the air. However, part of the point is to play the character you see, and the character I saw there was a brash, naive and faith-riddled - brave, if you will. It's a small enough price to play brave characters in a roleplaying game, as nobody will hit me with a stick even if the character dies for their bravery. Were a stick involved, I guess I would've had my character answer with immediate maximum lethal force to a stranger approaching them at a beach, instead of going to talk to them unarmed and in open formation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447006/#Comment_447006" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T06:03:35+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  6:03AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep!
