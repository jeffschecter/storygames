I got there by playing and GMing or facilitating literally dozens of genuinely different games across the past 5 years or so. If a game provides tools that make it really easy to GM (Mouse Guard, 3:16, etc. etc.), you can also gain access to some of those tools when running other things, because you learn good habits of, let's say, scene-framing. I experienced this a bit when I ran 4E, though not as much as I would have liked: I drew on my experiences running Mouse Guard, PTA, and other things to help my DMing.<br/>Matt</blockquote>\nI\u2019m new to story games (my first con was two months ago) but I now play them as often as possible. But I don\u2019t want to wait 5 years to get good. I want to be good as close to now as possible. I think I might speed up this process with a lot of solid criticism by folks that I don\u2019t game with much.

If I was expected to run the game, add $40.</li>\n<li>About $180, negotiable based on play length and game details.</li>\n</ul>\nI based those figures on a scale of $20/hour, for a 5 hour game with an hour discussion afterward. Running a game is generally worth about 2 hours prep, I figure. Something pretty complex, like Burning Wheel or Smallville, might bumpe that up an hour or two. I decided the extra handling time of setting up a Skype conference was worth an extra hour, and the extra drudgery of listening thoughtfully to a 4-5 hour audio is equivalent to a couple more hours.<br/><br/>Now, that's all assuming I decided to offer this service for money in the first place. It's tricky to evaluate what you're worth charging money for, when you're talking about something you love doing. Because all three of those things are something I've done for free, at least in part. I've watched games being played, though usually not the whole session. I definitely play games with people for free (duh!), and I'm more than willing to discuss it afterward--what went well, what fell flat, what could be improved, what new techniques could be brought in, etc. I've done that for free and at some length with a close friend or two, and online i've been on both the giving and receiving end. And while Kevin Wieser has mysteriously not called me up for any Skype critiques, I've certainly listened to many hours of Walking Eye AP recording, simply because I wanted to. (Though it still is a drudgery, attending to that kind of audio for any length of time. I had a long commute that enabled me to do it.)<br/><br/>So, the thing is, people who do what they love find it in themselves all the time to charge money for it. Musicians take gigs and sell CDs. Consultants in all kinds of fields, professional AND hobby, get paid simply to talk to people about stuff they do, and how they might do it better. Professional mediators help people sort out their shit for money, whereas a thoughtful and trusted relative might do that without a thought of charging.<br/><br/>I'd have a hard time convincing myself it was OK to accept money for roleplaying and roleplaying-related services. But that's something I could overcome by reminding myself that my time and skill is valuable, that I do have insight and expertise to offer, and that getting paid for doing something you love is a helluva lot better than getting paid for something you hate. I've had to go through a similar process to convince myself it's OK to charge money for a story game I've written.<br/><br/>There are some issues and landmines, for sure. Like, if playing, watching and critiquing roleplaying games is a job, then where do I draw the line? Am I always on duty, and thus have to turn down casual coaching requests because "sorry, I charge for that?" Or do friends get a pass? Or do they only get a pass case-by-case, if you feel like it? It's like having a friend who's a masseuse; everyone is hoping for free backrubs from her, just this once, because I'm so tense and we're pals, right, but if she gave out free massages to everyone she knows she'd wear herself out and still not make rent that month. If I entered into this kind of venture I'd be sure to seek the advice and perspective of people I know who have done similar kinds of coaching/tutoring gigs.<br/><br/>I did <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/fluency-in-the-forest/" rel="nofollow">run a story game for money</a>, once. A primitive skills organization I'd worked for as a camp counselor asked me to come up to their adult camp and run a fireside storyjam to help teach the trackers storytelling methods that they could use to process their woodland experiences. I ran a stripped-down In a Wicked Age with playing cards, using an Oracle that we made together based on wildlife sightings from their day's tracking.<br/><br/>It was nice. It was fun. it was a learning experience for me, as well as for them. And I made bank. It wasn't a game with friends, though. I maintained a politely professional relationship with the event organizer, and if he contacts me again, I'll do the same.<br/><br/>Would I be willing to charge my friends for a service like this? I think so. I know someone who charges friends for music lessons, and I wouldn't dream trying to wheedle them out of him for free. On the other hand, he HAS given songwriting workshops for free, when he chooses to. So it's just something that requires more careful navigating than a serveice offered to strangerss.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_337237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337237/#Comment_337237" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T23:51:55+00:00" title="August  4, 2011 11:51PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \u2022\tWhat would you charge to observe a session of play and then comment afterwards?<br/>I would not sit passively and observe a session.

If we are hangin\u2019 just like best bro\u2019s, are you going to be able to be mean enough?

Ross just ran a short and sweet workshop on escalation that was pretty helpful for me.<br/><br/>Or maybe we could try for a generic \u201cthree improves, three sustains\u201d to be discussed Sunday after a weekend of play. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to find three improves for you though. I\u2019m so new to this style of play that my critiques of others are pretty flimsy. Maybe we could just discuss how I played for long time? (Which feels selfish to me). <br/><br/>Again, this is just me trying to create some sort of structure or formalize this criticism to protect relationships, which is what hiring a tutor was all about. I need someone who has a strong opinion that I respect, but who I am not worried about offending. I also need to be guilt free about the time that person is spending on me.

Absolutely. My answers above were taking seriously the "hypothetically, I'm hiring you as a tutor" premise. But hell yeah, I'll talk to you about this shit, as a friend, on or offline, anytime we have the time and space for it.<br/><br/>Second, I've found that the most useful critique isn't grounded so much in telling you everything you did wrong, or what you sucked at, but in looking at what worked well, what felt awkward, what could be improved, and so forth. Sounds similar to the "three improves, three sustains" you were mentioning. Was that Ross's technique?<br/><br/>I've noticed in the midst of your wonderful enthusiasm to learn and improve as a new storygamer that you're tending to focus on how meager your skills are and how little you know and how much you screw up, at least by your own self-judgment. I've played with you just once, but it was one of your first games ever if I'm not mistaken, and I found you pleasant and skilful to play with. Not that you couldn't improve, but I didn't in the least walk away thinking "man, cool game I guess but Morgan really brought it down," or 'Jeez, that Morgan guy messed up the whole session!" I didn't think a single critical thought about your play, in fact. I really dug what you were doing. yet in your excellent <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=328230" rel="nofollow">actual play report</a> you seemed to think you had done a poor job at playing the game. The issues you raised were good ones to reflect on, but i'm much more comfortable discussing them as learning experiences than as screwups.<br/><br/>The key here is that the debrief process is focused on <i>how you felt</i> when you played, rather than someone's arbitrary judgment of how it sucked or was awesome or whatevs. <i>Even if that arbitrary judger is yourself</i>. Maybe especially. It's more helpful for you, in the long run, if you can learn to contextualize your own experience outside of value judgments. Not "well, I really dropped the ball there," but rather "When I did X, I felt like the momentum of the game stopped dead." And then I (or Joe, or Ross, or whoever) could say "oh, what do you think made it do that?" And you could reflect, and say "well, by presenting X in terms of Y, I think I inadvertently gave the impression to the other players that their input wasn't needed there." Or whatever.<br/><br/>This all teaches you (for whatever value of "you"--the "you" in the above paragraph is actually "me") to evaluate yourself honestly without guilt-tripping or running yourself down, and to focus on improving what works for YOU, not measuring up to some monolithic outside idea of what constitutes "good gaming." The tutor/debriefer/helpful friend can provide input on best practices, their own impressions from observing and playing, etc, but it's a process that's aimed at aiding your own drive for self-improvement, not imposing our own standards on you.<br/><br/>My friend Willem Larsen, founder of <a href="http://www.languagehunters.org/" rel="nofollow">Language Hunters</a> (formerly Where are Your Keys? for those in the know) has used these techniques for years, and I've found them very helpful for debriefing facilitating experiences of all kinds, from leading languagehunting tables to running story games. It's helpful without doing verbal violence to each other.<br/><br/>Look forward to much playing AND much talking at Cosycon!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337692/#Comment_337692" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T16:56:34+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  4:56PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>I will happily workshop your gaming skills with you, as much as you want.

It'd have to be outside the actual con space. Like, we could go for a twenty minute debrief walk after each session we play together, and I could tear into your playstyle (with love).<br/><br/>2.) I'd need a super clear articulation of what you wanted critiqued, and why. For example, "I want to play a female character... but I'm worried about doing an inauthentic portrayal. I want to know if I'm doing it right, so that I can explore characters that are other genders and creeds and races... and do so with authenticity and integrity."<br/><br/>3.) You'd need to recognize, in your heart of hearts, that there is no "skill bar" one must pass in order to play story games, and that a great big component of the joy is the spontaneous community project that arises when we tell a story together. You'd need to recognize that no one else is asking you to be better. And so, I guess, you'd need to be looking to improve only to satisfy yourself, to achieve new personal heights, to explore new personal terrain.<br/><br/>If you're down with those caveats, I will absolutely be available to tag for critique and workshopping.<br/>Alternately, you can hire me on a monthly basis, for $500/mnth, and I'll move down to Olympia and be around all the time.

Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no \u201cbad self talk\u201d going on in my head. I think I kick ass. That\u2019s why I\u2019m certain that I will soon be the BEST at all story games. Evah.<br/><br/>Also, I always \u201cfeel\u201d like everything went great during every session. I have huge fun every time I roleplay, just like I have since ran a poorly prepared session of Pirates and Plunder in middle school. You suggest letting my own feelings guide me, but I already do that automatically. I already have access to how I feel. I want more. <br/><br/>After a lot of reflection and other stimuli I can figure out some things to improve. I need to work hard to come up with problems and it can be difficult for me to voice concerns due to a lack of knowledge about the correct terminology. That\u2019s why the AP took as long as it did to write and why it is full of downer talk. <br/><br/>I\u2019ve been having a fascinating discussion with Wilhelm since he whispered to me in this thread, where he makes similar points about not letting others\u2019 opinions influence me unduly. What I keep trying to tell him is that I\u2019m not doormat. I\u2019m going to think critically about any advice given and test it against the world. And with that defense up, the best strategy for me is to solicit as much harsh advice from as many sources as possible. The person dispensing advice will also have to deal with potentially being ignored. <br/><br/>My play-style has an audience just like if I wrote a paper or you designed a game. I wouldn\u2019t submit a paper that hadn\u2019t been edited by at least one other person any more than you would publish a game that hadn\u2019t been playtested. Also, I would never tell my editor to only give me feedback on the parts of the paper that I worried were poor, just like you probably don\u2019t pre-censor your playtesters. Can those who offer critiques give you advice that you don\u2019t think is helpful or correct? Of course. But you evaluate it as best as you can and then either accept or reject it. I want the same thing for my play style. <br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Joe">@Joe</a>,<br/>You are so generous with your time. I still feel guilty\u2026 but I think I\u2019ll get over myself. Getting \u201coutside the con\u201d before advice-giving is solid. Your 1st and 3rd requirements seem doable. <br/><br/>Number 2 sounds like the hardest and I think it might even tie in with what Joel was talking about. Every time I hear about another gaming concept I think, \u201cBoy, I\u2019m not doing that and I wish I was.\u201d Is there any way you could give me a pass on 2 occasionally and offer improvements from the blue? I could use the illumination and I can take the heat. <br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a>,<br/>Hey, buddy, $500/month a MY price for Joe. Get your own quote.  <br/><br/>Ross does have an eye for the bargains, but I sense the coming bidding war between Daniel and Joe. Maybe we could get a bulk rate on the both of them?

I don't mean "I can only tell you what you program me to tell you." I just mean that the process of critique is most useful when the critiquer knows your goals and your objectives. If I don't know what you want to improve on, my advice will quickly devolve into, "That session could have used more masturbation scenes." Because masturbation scenes are always hilarious, poignant and beautiful.<br/><br/>So, yeah. When you hand a paper to someone for peer review, they can read your thesis. They know what you're driving towards, and can help make sure the rest of the paper supports that thesis statement. In order for someone (anyone) to give you effective playstyle critique, you must make your thesis apparent to them.<br/><br/>Except, obvo it's not a thesis. It's a vision, a goal. It can be half-formed and half-baked, it can just be a nugget of an idea. But the more direction you provide, the more meaningful your critique will be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337856/#Comment_337856" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T13:38:09+00:00" title="August  9, 2011  1:38PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see what you're saying.

But because Joe is a wise and proven gamer, my critique will take the form of holding you to his advice. In that vein, I will be expecting more masturbation scenes in our next apocalypse world session. You will feel the weight of my critique when I give you "the look" each and every time you take part in a scene that doesn't involve masturbation, thrusting shame upon you with my silent judgment. <br/><br/>In your other thread, someone mentioned a gaming tutor is like having a tutor teach you how to masturbate. The irony of the accuracy of his statement is profound; the obvious penultimate next step in your journey to gaming greatness is to have a true master of masturbation and role-playing train you to make the most out of your masturbation scenes. Obviously that master is Joe.<br/><br/>I do have some reservations to offering you more detailed critique. The thing is, I'm nearly always surprised and impressed by your roleplaying, and the same goes for everyone else I game with. At the same time, I'm very self conscious and self critical of my own, and I'm constantly thinking of something I wish I had said after the moment to speak it already passed. I feel I often get lost in the subtext, thinking a lot of interesting thoughts about what my character might be thinking in a way that brings me out of the moment, making it difficult to quickly and aptly respond to the current situation.<br/><br/>I feel like this is ultimately the nature of improv and storygaming, that you can't always think of the perfect line on the spot. But surprisingly often, you come up with something that everyone else has a great response to, just by trying your best. I feel like my best moments come from trusting myself and being spontaneous, and my worst come from overthinking and being self conscious. So you would need to approach my critique with the understanding that I hold no claims to perfection and that I'm searching for the same improvement. Also, any critique I could provide you with would be second to giving you the confidence to follow your inspiration spontaneously. The last thing I would want is to teach another player to think about roleplaying the same way I do, what makes story games interesting is when other players think of things I would never think of.<br/><br/>Now, with that in mind, if you were willing to throw the whole "tutor" idea out the window, and have a conversation with me where we took turns offering each other feedback and criticism on each other's roleplaying, I would feel a lot more comfortable. Because you have just as much to teach me as I have to teach you. This is something I would be happy to do for free and at length.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338044/#Comment_338044" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T11:07:33+00:00" title="August 10, 2011 11:07AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orion Canning</cite>In your other thread, someone mentioned a gaming tutor is like having a tutor teach you how to masturbate.</blockquote>\nThat parallel is super apt.<br/>Partially because, if you've never read a book or internet article on how to masturbate better, you could probably benefit from doing so.<br/>Same with seeking out a mentor.<br/><br/>Man, I sure do know how to derail a thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338055/#Comment_338055" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T11:47:24+00:00" title="August 10, 2011 11:47AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2011 11:50AM by zircher.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to avoid posting in this thread and then I remembered that I bought Mythic GME.

It IS good to know that about your posting mindset. I guess I would then say that it's difficult for <i>me</i> to engage with you in your self-reflection when it's couched in those terms, because my brain is constantly fighting to recontextualize your experiences from "mistakes" and "getting it right" to "growth" and "getting it even better."<br/><br/>My experience with the kind of debriefing I'm talkng about is that a good self-reflection buddy will (A) help me dig around to honestly access my feelings (frex identifying a nagging doubt or dissatisfaction buried under all the "woo awesome", (B) help me contextualize my feelings in useful ways (frex figuring out WHAT SPECIFIC HAPPENING triggered that feeling--what were we actually doing in that scene that fed into the feeling of awesome? What was it about what ___ said that triggered my misgivings?), and (C) provide useful input from their own experiences that are targeted to my own feelings, circumstances and needs (frex "When I've encountered that difficulty I've tried X," or "I find that the thing keeps the feeling of Y sustained is paying attention to Z."<br/><br/>So it's still "more" than just you and your feelings, but hopefully that shows how it's valuable to keep it grounded in what you are feeling and experiencing?<br/><br/>Anyway, feel free to accept whatever kind of feedback from whatever people are available! Joe is super-rad and one of my favorite co-masturba--er, reflection buddies.
