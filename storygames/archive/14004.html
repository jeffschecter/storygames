I always GM (dislike playing) and we typically do gritty low-fantasy games (lots of Burning Wheel - currently doing Burning Wheel Ravenloft).  We've played most Indie favorites like all of Vincent's stuff, Sorcerer, Dust Devils, Lacuna, etc. but lately we're a little burnt out.<br/><br/>The problem is that my players really want to do some high fantasy as opposed to our typical game.  They want magic to be present and not something out of the ordinary.  I'm not completely comfortable with this aesthetic (I prefer to Tolkien-esque take on magic) but I'm willing to give it a shot.  Additionally one of the players expressed a desire to do something a little lighter than our typical deep-engrossing drama style play.  If we don't find a game to suit this style we will probably drop RPGs for awhile and go back to Boardgames/Miniature games.<br/><br/>The help I am asking for is identifying a high fantasy game that rocks.  These actually don't seem very common on the Indie scene but if there's a mainstream game that you think is awesome please let me know.<br/><br/>In doing my own research I came across the game Spellbound Kingdoms which seemed very interesting.  The revised version is due out in a matter of a couple weeks and some of the mechanics were fresh and different.  The only problem is that magic is snuffed out by those in charge so that they can keep it for themselves.  The group doesn't want to worry about being persecuted for being a magic user (this happens way too often in our games historically).<br/><br/>Another possibility is an old-school retro clone, maybe.  Lamentations of the Flame Princess seemed awesome but the more I learned the more it sounded like it was low-fantasy horror and again, not what the group is looking for.<br/><br/>Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317269/#Comment_317269" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-20T11:08:59+00:00" title="March 20, 2011 11:08AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charles,<br/><br/>What I would want to do in that situation is: be okay with having a group that's all tuckered out, find something light to take a break with, honour the group's wishes.<br/><br/>Castle Ravenloft is a fun, easy board game that remixes 4th Edition D&amp;D.

We've played Castle Ravenloft in the past and enjoyed it but it's not really our thing.  We play a ton of board-games on off-weeks or on extra nights when we hang out (Battlestar Galactica, Pandemic, Merchants and Marauders, and Dominion are our favs) but we would really like to find another RPG and maybe try something different.<br/><br/>I'll take a look at Dungeon Squad.<br/><br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ignotus</cite><br/>Why not just change the setting a little so magic users aren't persecuted?</blockquote>\nThat's a good question.  It seems like a big part of the setting as "witches" are persecuted and burned and if you fail to cast a spell bad things happen and secret societies and witch hunters come after you.  I guess we could always re-boot the entire setting and do what we want with it but that seems like a great deal of work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317273/#Comment_317273" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-20T11:24:34+00:00" title="March 20, 2011 11:24AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Caveat: I'm not really sure what "high fantasy" means.</p>\n<p>Glorantha is well known for having ubiquitous magic, and is served by the relatively-trad Runequest (latest being Mongoose's Runequest II), as well as the seriously-indie HeroQuest.</p>\n<p>Since you already seem to like Burning Wheel, seems like the Magic Burner could probably provide you with a lower-stakes system tuned to your preferences.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ally%20Nauss" title="Ally Nauss"><img alt="Ally Nauss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ally%20Nauss">Ally Nauss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317280/#Comment_317280" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-20T12:40:33+00:00" title="March 20, 2011 12:40PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When our group was feeling a bit burnt out (our BW campaign was over the year mark), we took a year to play mixed games (a few episodes of a 40k hack of Dogs, Dust Devils, Mouseguard, a few one-shots of Mist-Robed gate and Annalise, some Fiasco, a little Artesia, a little Shadowrun... Nothing for too long). We then spent a few months on Dresden Files and are now hitting Apocalypse World pretty hard. It took us a while to find something we wanted to play long-term, but we had fun "test-driving" a bunch of games.<br/><br/>We loved Dresden Files for it's use of magic, the great setting we had developed (underground London!), and the diversity of characters. It was something fun and fresh and the books made for great, easy reads for our players.

There's magic and elves and daemons, but it's a grim, dark world where you're not going to end up living in a white castle with a beauitful spouse and happy peasants singing your praises and there is no such thing as resurrection, dead is dead unless it's undead.  If that's the kind of high fantasy desired, then it's not the one to pick.  Captain Jack Sparrow is a good model for what a successful character in warhammer ends up as - slightly loopy, in need of a bath, prized possession is cursed, 2 out of 3 women you meet smack you in the face, somebody else got the girl.<br/><br/>Warhammer also has a "tradition" of feeling a bit beer and pretzels in its sense of humour built into NPC's (all orks talk like low class Brits) and setting (e.g., you're going to the town ruled by the von Sapontheim family' - get that, the "once upon a time" family) though that can be tuned up or down at a table.<br/><br/>3rd edition Warhammer is simple to play once you get hang of it, very little rules referencing at table.  Scenarios can be combat or social heavy, you can run a horror-themed adventure in it (attacking players mental stress pools).  <br/><br/>Downsides - the price point to enter is higher than an indie game but on par with a traditional one, the rulebook in the boxed set is not the best organized, the ruleset is designed to blend in with and support the setting, particularly in the magic side of things. E.G., it is intrinsic to magic use that it is risky and may generate miscasts as it is using Chaos energy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317292/#Comment_317292" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-20T14:46:20+00:00" title="March 20, 2011  2:46PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.latorra.org/dungeon-world/" rel="nofollow">Dungeon World</a> I'll second Dungeon World<br/><br/>Also <a href="http://www.oldschoolhack.net/" rel="nofollow">Old School Hack</a> is a LOT of fun as well<br/><br/>The various D&amp;D clones are a lot of fun and can be easily hacked. <br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5815&amp;page=2#Item_8" rel="nofollow">Ryuu Tama</a> would also do<br/><br/><a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=4533" rel="nofollow">Cheap and Cheesy FRPG</a> available <a href="www.lumpley.com/pdfs/cnc.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a><br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317294/#Comment_317294" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-20T15:11:53+00:00" title="March 20, 2011  3:11PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            agony,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you can play spellbound kingdoms and just ignore the magic is outlawed part. I played a few games of the first draft and just did not focus on this. and it worked fine. There is also other places to set the game. Windover (magic is still welcome), The fringe of civilization and the savages (classic adventuring), Dragon Isle (against the evil lord), and Jakata... where maybe magic is given respect. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe easiest thing, and what I did for one of the games I ran was to give the players legitimacy. They were part of a recognized organization that was allowed to use magic. it worked well. really well. PLus if your looking for a setting with some higher fantasy it does support that in spades. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly I am a big fan. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI played Dungeon World last night. I don't think it is quite ready to long term play., t was fun, but there were issues that need to be resolved. andf liek many other D&amp;D clones, it is just not that magical of a setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317295/#Comment_317295" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-20T15:38:49+00:00" title="March 20, 2011  3:38PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second Seth's recommendation of <i>Mortal Coil</i>.

Not sure of the state of the pay version or what it has in it. (Sage or Adam can probably give us an update.)<br/><br/>You could use Apocalypse World (AW) fronts, but you probably don't need to buy the book. An AW front is really just a clearly thought out threat, which details what the antagonists want and how it progresses over time wrapped up in a cool way. I have AW, but when I play Dungeon World I don't write out fronts, I just use realistic feeling enemies that have real wants and needs and that adapt to the players actions.<br/><br/>Given the type of game you are looking to play you could just grab any free fantasy adventure and adapt it to Dungeon World as you go. A good start is Tony Dowler's Purple Worm Graveyard as it was written for an earlier iteration by Tony called Apocalypse D&amp;D.

Sage and I are super proud of our almost-done little beast and it's nice to see people playing it.<br/><br/>Dungeon World comes, as Justin said, in two flavours - the free-for-all Dungeon World Hack (that you'll either need Apocalypse World or a really solid understanding of said to play) and Dungeon World proper.  The latter isn't "out" yet but will contain a fully fleshed out chapter describing how to create Fronts (both Dungeon and Campaign) and tie them together for short and long term play.  <br/><br/>As it's been said, you can "get by" with a copy of Dungeon World hack and an idea of what you want your campaign to be like, but the full version will have as robust a toolkit for building adversarial game elements as Apocalypse World proper contains.  <br/><br/>As for the state of it - well, the content is just about finished now - we're doing editing passes and shoring up the layout now.  If you want a sneak preview, give DW hack a try, write some notes about your game and post an Actual Play report.  That'll get you in to the Adventurer's Guild - where you can score sneak previews of the print PDF and bonus classes / adventures once the game itself has been released.<br/><br/>My suggestion?  Find one of Tony's microdungeons from <a href="http://blog.microdungeons.com/" rel="nofollow">his blog</a> and give it a shot.  Try it as a one-shot for your group to play-test what Dungeon World might look like in their hands.<br/><br/>You can grab DW version 11/03/06 here - <a href="http://www.latorra.org/2011/03/07/dungeon-world-version-11-03-06/" rel="nofollow">http://www.latorra.org/2011/03/07/dungeon-world-version-11-03-06/ </a> and if you have any questions about the game specifically or rules or anything you'd like to yell at us about, drop an email to <a href="mailto://gm@dungeon-world.com" rel="nofollow">GM@Dungeon-World.com</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317328/#Comment_317328" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-20T22:33:17+00:00" title="March 20, 2011 10:33PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You may also be able to play a high fantasy version of Burning Wheel using the Magic Burner and starting with a larger number of life paths.
