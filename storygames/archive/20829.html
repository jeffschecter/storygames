In fact, this is the most Lovecraftian RPG I've ever encountered. The only fundamental difference are the <i>anxieties</i> addressed. For example, concerns over the other (and its racist implications) are absent, but concerns over issues specifically relevant to women are there in spades, and it has me thinking that perhaps gender is largely defined by a set of concerns, and that horror as a genre is essentially feminine in nature.<br/><br/>In addition the game's feminine perspective feels authentic rather than forced, the art and layout (on the Kickstarter alone) lickably gorgeous, the writing threateningly sensual, the system supports the premise and gives players permission to explore it, the rules are clear, the prep engaging, and play easy to jumpstart.<br/><br/>It's not even finished and I think it's a <i>masterpiece</i>.<br/><br/>My only concern are the politics which I'm <i>certain</i> will get in the way. I've already seen people with otherwise insightful comments refer to potential customers as 'allies'. We don't need that. The work stands on its own, and making it about women in gaming rather than the work of three wonderful individuals <i>who happen to be women</i> will only serve to <i>erase</i> them.<br/><br/>Because a man is recognized for their individual achievements, while a woman is recognized for the achievements of all women. How is that equality? And the biggest problem in promoting this is figuring out how <i>not</i> to appear as if there's a feminist agenda behind it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457388/#Comment_457388" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-22T05:11:19+00:00" title="October 22, 2016  5:11AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think all horror is feminine, but there certainly is a feminine strain of horror that BB embraces.

Li said better than I could:<br/><br/>"Bluebeard's Bride blew me away when I first played it, in no small part because it contains some fascinating technologies.<br/><br/>First of all, there is an effect that I have a hard time describing that I have come to increasingly value in media, a sort of feminized structure. Historically, the "female-centric" version of something has taken what is perceived to be "feminine content", and stuck it into spaces that "masculine content" occupies, within a design narrative that is fundamentally still based on masculine logic.<br/><br/>The simplest example of this I've historically used is Copenhagen Beer-- a beer "for women" whose presentation doesn't involve "girly' images, but rather a sort of elegance that rethinks the contexts in which women may want to approach beer-- namely, while feeling haute instead of just casual fun. (Seriously, go image search it, it's very educational.)<br/><br/>Bluebeard's Bride does the same thing with indy rpgs. When I first played it, I was most struck by a sort of frictionlessness of the experience of immersing in play that I didn't know I had previously felt restricted in.<br/><br/>It takes the question of "what is gradual horror?" and answers it from scratch from a feminine perspective. It's not a "classic" (read, historically masculine-conceived) horror story about the encroachment of a dangerous man, a creepy house, and unsettling clothing. Instead, it's about a growing unease of reality, and the creeping boundaries between the real self and the performed self, and their eventual dissolution.<br/><br/>What's lovely about Bluebeard's Bride, in short, is that you could hypothetically take classically masculine content, plug it in, and it would still be a game of feminine horror.<br/><br/>To get there, Bluebeard's Bride introduces a number of new and essential techniques for onboarding the player to this new but deeply immersive way of thinking. From the way it ritualistically begins with the telling of the story so that there are no surprises, to the unexpected effect of thinking the ring is power when it's really not, to the core all-players-are-the-same-character design, I fully expect it to be profoundly seminal in the this field.<br/><br/>The fact that the Apocalypse engine is nigh-unrecognizable is a huge advantage-- Bluebeard's Bride does a beautiful job of stripping what it needs from historical options and re-oozing it together in an entirely new way.<br/><br/>Anybody who wants to produce representative games at a structural rather than purely content level needs to see this game.<br/><br/><br/>(PS, while we are talking about structure-- structure can be strengthened greatly by gravitas, and gravitas can actually be built with money. If you are an ally and backer, please consider backing at one level higher than you ordinarily would.)"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457457/#Comment_457457" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-24T22:45:20+00:00" title="October 24, 2016 10:45PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic.

"Frictionless experience of immersing" is big for me.  Ritual tellings and creeping unease also make me happy.  Focusing on talking, rather than pressing numeric/mechanical buttons, is also totally my bag.<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly what here is the killer new tech.  All of the above is true of <i>Society of Dreamers</i> too, if I remember right.  Well, except for the "one character" and "use it for gradual horror and dissolving boundaries between real/performed self" bits!  Maybe the key is how it all works together.  Or maybe there's a lot more to the structure than J. gets into there.<br/><br/>"Thinking the ring is power"?  Does that refer to a ring of keys that unlocks the doors?

Also, think of all of the work and extra costs of completing the many stretch goals. I think a high quality product was important to the designers. You could go the PDF route for $20, plus you receive all of the very generous stretch goal stuff included. I don't think $20 for two PDF books is unusual or unreasonable. Also, the game works fine with just the books. You can get a very high quality book, two PDFs and all of the added stretch goal stuff for $50; I also think that this price is fairly standard. I think if you take a look at all the extra work required for the strech goals you will see why the price point was required. I went the extreme route and backed the $150 goal being I'm a completist; I do admit it is a hit to the wallet but I don't think the designers are motivated by a cash grab at all. I really think that there is a lot of extra work involved in the product and the stretch goals. Also, it is better to over estimate costs and deliver than to fail and leave the project unfulfilled.

Of course, you might need the second PDF to play which would bring it up to $20. The books are pricey (especially the upper tiers) and I definitely respect people's decision to not purchase them, I just think there are reasons for the price that are understandable; of course, it would really be nice to see them offer discounts for gamers with modest incomes.

If they take a Token of Disloyalty, they mark an additional trauma.

I can deal with intense horror and psychologically disturbing content. There are other games that emulate this that I find both manageable and attractive (i.e. Little Fears 2e or some Nordic Larp stuff).<br/><br/>It's just a certain mood of wicked hopelessness and despair invoked by Bluebeard's Bride (or what I imagine it to be) that I would not enjoy playing.<br/>Also with movies, I find most horror movies either boring or repulsive.
