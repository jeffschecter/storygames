I have been tossing an idea around in my head for a while for an interesting way to start a new campaign. I find that new campaigns are always either starting out very slow, or are somehow missing a level of intrigue to keep the new group of players interested and committed to coming back. So I thought of a new way to start a campaign (I am certain this has been done but I haven't seen it). Beginning with the end.<br/><br/>So the premise is that you start the game by handing out the "high level" version of the player character sheets, with strange equipment and powers on the sheets (as appropriate for the game you are running). The players start the game in the final battle with the "big bad" or as they are entering the final lair. You seed the final encounter with implied history, and implied questions, which the players then will play through the campaign to find out the origins and answers. So for example, you might have a gleaming crystal sword that one of the players uses to cut the dark god. Where did it come from? How did we get it? One of the evil lieutenants has it out for a member of the party, obviously recognizing him and expressing his hatred for what he did (maybe he is missing a hand or something?).  So the final battle and encounters occur, seeded with various pieces of implied history via NPCs, items, scars, dialogue, etc. The fight is brutal, it seems the players may not survive. They need something else to aid them, if only they could have obtained it. <br/><br/>Before the battle can be resolved, the players awaken, groggy, in a thick haze of hallucinatory incense, in the cramped wagon of a gypsy fortune teller. The fortune teller smiles wanly, "That was my last fortune... remember that the future is not written... for we are the pen and ink that writes on the scroll of time... you must succeed, or all is lost. The dark one is coming... only you can stop it...good bye..." and the fortune teller passes away.  <br/><br/>I think this sort of beginning could work well because it has a nice epic battle start, and although it may seem there is some railroading, it should be apparent that the players can change their destinies. I do not plan on figuring out the answers to all of the questions for this first scene until playing to find out what happens. This can open up some interesting things during play. Where do we get that sweet sword? Why did that guy hate the paladin so much?  Then during the course of play, you can sprinkle in those things and change the outcome based upon how the players handle things. Maybe the NPC that hated the paladin is saved this time, and is an ally in the final battle. It allows you some foreshadowing without setting anything in stone.  Remember that the battle never even ended in the vision, and there could be some kind of twist that happens afterward as well. Maybe the dark god is actually the fallen angel that the party helps break into heaven during the course of play. Maybe the lieutenant is a holy warrior in the present time that wants to help the party. It is important for the first scene to be littered with a lot of implied history and questions. The players will likely pursue some of these questions on their own as well. Is there a crystalline sword mentioned anywhere in the history books? Where did it come from? Who used it last? <br/><br/>So please, feel free to share your thoughts and ideas. I would like to start a game of perhaps "Dungeon World" or something similar using a scenario similar to the above. I am open to thoughts, ideas, criticisms and anything else you feel is relevant to the topic.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>Mike                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robutmike" title="robutmike"><img alt="robutmike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robutmike">robutmike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415909/#Comment_415909" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T12:30:22+00:00" title="June 10, 2013 12:30PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2013 12:43PM by robutmike.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just thought of a way to make this even better for something like Dungeon World.

For example:<br/><br/>"The mighty dragons guarding this tower are impervious to normal weapons, but you have brought something with you to smite them.

One time, a character had a dream about a bloodied body in his bed, only to discover at the end when the dream came true that the body in his bed was his own, and that the character he played was an abomination that had taken his body.<br/><br/>In another scenario, the characters started with a dinner where the host told them to tell about their last week in the village. I then framed scenes in the past, and while playing the players started to wonder why they had dinner with such a lowlife. At the end, they discovered that they had come only to tell the host that he was going to die.<br/><br/>In a third scenario, I started by narrating a ritual being watched by the crowd, when suddenly a bunch of people broke loose and started to run against the priest responsible for the ritual. I then cut the scene and started a new scene. My thought was that those people were the players' characters running to stop the impostor playing the priest, but I had to follow up with a backup plan with rebels trying to assassinate the priest, because the players made some really smart plans.<br/><br/>The thing that the easiest way to game master these kind of scenarios, is to get the players on the same track. Having a final scene like this to strive for is actually the same thing as having a mysterious man at an inn, offering the characters a quest. As you can tell from my examples above, you can still have a twist, even if that's not necessary. The interesting thing is the way to the final scene.<br/><br/><b>Movies on this theme</b><br/>The Usual Suspects<br/>American Beauty (using the same narrating tool as the previous one)<br/>Irr\xe9versible<br/>Memento (using the same narrating tool as the previous one)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robutmike" title="robutmike"><img alt="robutmike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robutmike">robutmike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415982/#Comment_415982" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T09:06:27+00:00" title="June 11, 2013  9:06AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the suggestions and discussion guys. <br/><br/>Felan, The unlockable powers as a video game trope always has me thinking of the Metroid games and Megaman X games. Certainly there is some of that flavor in the final scene. I want to avoid overusing the powers and equipment, as I want to focus on story elements, but certainly I plan to sprinkle some of that in and I think it fits well with the epic fantasy battle type encounter.<br/><br/>DreamofPeace, I like the idea of revisiting the future as being changed with several twists. Sort of a "butterfly effect" flash forward. Perhaps I could have one of the characters or regular NPCs somehow gifted with prophecy or something, dreaming of the changed future that they have created because of their recent actions. Certainly it would be interesting but very challenging for me as a DM/storyteller. I almost think it would be cool at some point to allow some limited time travel to revise their adventure, maybe a limited use artifact or something. Hmmm...<br/><br/>Noofy, I ordered the In a Wicked Age pdf today. Should get a file sometime later I think so I will check it out this afternoon/evening. I have heard good things.<br/><br/>Rickard, The movies that use this kind of idea were certainly my inspiration for wanting to start a campaign like this. Thanks for listing a few though, that got me thinking about new ways to use this as a way to set up a few possible plot devices during play.<br/><br/>Still debating on how much creative control from the players I should put in this scenario. I want them to create the story with me, but I also worry that if I go too far with the leading questions they will get stuck. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415986/#Comment_415986" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T10:16:23+00:00" title="June 11, 2013 10:16AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Still debating on how much creative control from the players I should put in this scenario.

Like all of it.<br/><br/>You're starting them off with what looks like a railroad. But instead, make it into a target - like the hole in golf. Tell them it's their job to get things there to where that scene, or a scene very like it, happens. But they can use any route they want and they can tweak the situation however they want. Put the challenge in their hands.<br/><br/>In order to make that work, there should always be good reasons to make that final confrontation happen. But don't turn it into a GM vs Player thing. If they start to circumvent the final confrontation, ask them to tell you why it still needs to happen. Keep putting it back into their hands.<br/><br/>If you want to use this for Dungeon World, you pretty much have to do it that way if you're going to run the game using the agenda and principles, because part of the agenda is "Play to find out what happens", and with a setup like this, it can be very tempting to plan what happens instead of play to find out. Treat that final encounter like an X on the map, but with lots of blanks (Draw maps, leave blanks) between where the characters are and that X (and lots of blanks inside the X itself). Then do lots of "Ask questions and use the answers" and "Make a more that follows" in order to get there. Which is tricky to do, because you're setting yourself up with a solid temptation toward railroading. If you keep those key principles solidly in mind, they should guide you toward how to accomplish what you are wanting to do without violating the agenda and principles of DW.<br/><br/>The other part that might be tricky is the "Think dangerous" part. Make sure you come up with lots of ideas about how you can threaten the characters and cause them negative consequences without keeping them from being able to reach that final confrontation that you've set up. And again, get them involved. Ask them how they can possibly go on even though that ogre just snapped their spine and left them paralyzed. "Embrace the fantastic" may be helpful in that regard, though it needs to be handled carefully to not end up as unsatisfying deus ex machina.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415987/#Comment_415987" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T10:20:20+00:00" title="June 11, 2013 10:20AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2013 10:20AM by Praion.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -delete this- Rob said everything i thought is important                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415990/#Comment_415990" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T10:42:40+00:00" title="June 11, 2013 10:42AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are (at least) two possible directions you can go here:<br/><br/>1. Establish a strong final scene (however you like, ideally with lots of player input) and then make it mission, as a group, to drive the game towards that final scene. This is what Rob is describing, and I know some people have had success with it, but it can also be challenging. (Trying to figure out whether a certain event is going to derail the story or not while playing tends to have a paralyzing effect -- consider, for instance, that any characters/creatures in the final scene can't properly die during the story if you want the "final scene" to be sacrosanct.) So in this version everyone has to be fully on board and up to the creative challenge.<br/><br/>You're setting it out for the players: "Here's the final scene. Now: can you get there from starting point A? Go!"<br/><br/>2. Your vision seems to be more open-ended: the "final scene" is a prophecy or a potential future, but not carved in stone. This one is interesting, too. I would give the players almost total control of this final scene and tell them to go crazy: make it huge, dramatic, epic, twisted, full of betrayal and heroism.<br/><br/>Then, when we go back in time, the dynamic is reversed: now the players simply play their characters, while you grab material from the final scene they basically gave you to create adventures/situations for them. If someone was killed with a mighty magical sword in the final scene, then you can use that as a McGuffin in your adventures. If someone betrayed someone else, include some dark power for them to side with. If two characters seemed to be romantically entangled, throw in some obstacles: one of them starts off married, the other from a culture that's a sworn enemy of the first, there's a prophecy which says that one of them must die in order for X to happen, etc.<br/><br/>Now it's the other way around: the players are pitching a creative challenge to the GM, as it were.<br/><br/>Oh, and, of course:<br/><br/>End the "final scene" on a big cliffhanger before you go back in time to the storyline proper, so that at the end of the game you can have the two storylines meet up and, finally, discover how the story actually ended.<br/><br/><br/>(If you want to some discussion about this kind of game from a long time ago, look up "Snowball", a variation of the Pool. There was a written scenario for a game like this -- even with in-fiction justification: I believe a witch doctor was searching through the characters' memories to solve a crime mystery or something like that -- and lots of discussion about the various sessions on the Forge.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415991/#Comment_415991" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T10:45:01+00:00" title="June 11, 2013 10:45AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=7228.0" rel="nofollow">Here is</a> an example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robutmike" title="robutmike"><img alt="robutmike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robutmike">robutmike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416060/#Comment_416060" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T05:28:10+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  5:28AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, thanks for the suggestion, I have started writing a list of questions to use during the first session to guide the players in creating the final battle. <br/><br/>Paul, the Snowball variation of Pool looks interesting and should give me a few ideas, I grabbed the PDF from the thread for further study.<br/><br/>Much appreciated,<br/>Mike                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
