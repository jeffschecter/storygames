It's an opportunity to connect with potential playtesters<br/><br/>The thread is an experiment: it got used <a href="story-games.com/forums/discussion/19943/games-in-playtesting-development-january-2015" rel="nofollow">last month</a>, so I thought we could try it again.<br/><br/><br/><b>Principles for posting:</b><br/><br/>* Tell us about your game(s) in one post. Feel free to mention your game even if you've talked about it in last month's thread. The idea is to inform us about what you're doing now.<br/><br/>* Optionally: tell us what you're hoping to achieve this month.<br/><br/>* If you want to link to another thread, post, or rules document, go for it.<br/><br/>* There's no maximum number of games you can talk about. If developing your game is a genuine focus for you this month, then put it up. (This bit is definitely an experiment, so let's test how it works. If the thread gets a bit spammy, then maybe we need a different/actual limit.)<br/><br/><br/><b>If you're responding to a game someone else has posted about:</b><br/><br/>* Number your response (first response: [1]; second response [2]; third response [3]). If you see that you're the second person to post, "Wow, that looks cool!" to a post here, then put a "[2]" at the top of your post. <br/><br/>* The fourth person to post should just take their comment and create a new thread (or talk on an existing thread about the game), to continue the discussion.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442418/#Comment_442418" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-03T10:33:12+00:00" title="February  3, 2015 10:33AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm working on <i>Malandros</i>, a standalone DramaSystem game about street life in 1889 Rio de Janeiro. <br/>My to-do list for this month is to reorganise the text so it's more user friendly.<br/><br/>I'm also translating a science fiction game from Brazil called<i> UED</i>, but that's not really 'in development' because the original edition has been available for some time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442420/#Comment_442420" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-03T10:57:06+00:00" title="February  3, 2015 10:57AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Legends of the Elements is my current focus.

It is also a PbtA game, this one focused on action sci-fi featuring heroes on a spaceship, such as Mass Effect, Firefly, Farscape, and Star Wars. It has had a recent completely new draft, this time properly cleansing itself of Mass Effect-exclusive concepts. <br/>This draft is not up for revision quite yet, as it has had no playtesting. While I'm not actively seeking to playtest the game myself while I'm in the midst of my other game (I can't afford more than one weekly game), I'm looking for others to pick it up and give it a try!

The latest draft is here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nxUAQZrLGEqW1Hp_iLUmljOkHU9TT4N_mfDI_BPf6iI/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nxUAQZrLGEqW1Hp_iLUmljOkHU9TT4N_mfDI_BPf6iI/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>If by any chance you happen to be local to the L.A./Long Beach area and would be interested in these playtests please feel free to contact me.<br/><br/>Raven's Hollow needs to be played in person due to the custom deck.  However, Haunted, I think is fairly G+ Hangouts friendly.  If you're available for that let me know as well.  The main caveat is that the best days for me are weekdays and I work fairly late hours.  So you'd have to be available from around 9 to midnight Pacific time.  Although, Haunted is short enough that setting up a weekend game wouldn't be out of the question if there was significant interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442489/#Comment_442489" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-05T04:05:19+00:00" title="February  5, 2015  4:05AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2015 4:05AM by Steve_Hickey.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [1] <b>Jesse's games<br/></b><br/>I'd be available for a playtest for Haunted: 9pm Pacific is 6pm New Zealand time.<br/><br/>Also: Jesse didn't mention it, but he has game-specific circles on Google Plus if you're interested in following the development of one of his games.<br/><br/><br/>[1] <b>Devil and the Void</b><br/><br/>Mike, we have to get together on Skype soon and play this.
