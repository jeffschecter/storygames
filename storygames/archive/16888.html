the only request made by the Department employee was for us to keep a "low profile".<br/><br/>&lt;&lt;i&gt;mechanically it's an Easy mission of Quick length with one Condition attached to it&gt;<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/><b>3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Action Phase</span></b><br/>Unfortunately we could only play for a brief time ... about 2h total ... so just a bit more than 1h of Action time, if we factor out the CharGen process.<br/>In this time we accrued 2 Victory Points out of the 5 required by the Mission.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what happened:<br/><br/>- first our PCs got on the crime scene, and the events shaped up like a CLASSIC episode from CSI or some similar tv-show.<br/>We analyzed the corpse, we cross referenced the data at our disposal, we even checked the bank in front of the alley where the crime happened to see if we could get anything from its surveillance cameras.<br/>Turns out that someone moved the body from Downtown to Suburbia, dumping it in the backstreet.<br/><br/>- while investigating we often crashed on a wall of bureaucracy because, strangely enough, we seemed to lack enough SCL to access detailed info on the victim.<br/><br/>- we manage to secure the bank's surveillance video-tape (almost useless in its raw state) and then we decide to split the team...<br/><br/>- I was looking online for info in a SLA traffic database, but my SCL got rejected and my hacking attempt turned out as a D-Notice (then I rushedly cleaned up my traces and disconnected from the web).<br/>So I decided to physically go to the Perimeter Gate closest to the crime scene, to directly access the local surveillance computer, hoping to find some record of the person driving the car used for the body-dump.<br/><br/>- the Xeno went to the Department of Traffic &amp; Viability to also get info on the mistery driver, but squeezing one of his contacts, a human secretary that owed him more than a few favors.<br/><br/>- the Wraithen went home with the bank's video-tape and used her high-tech media equipment to cleanse and magnify both the video and audio tracks.<br/><br/>- shit starts surfacing ... apparently the car was property of the victim, but at the time the car passed the Gate the victim must have been (for our estimated HoD) already dead from more than one hour, possibly crammed into the trunk ... and when we got the driver's face all attempts of identification ended up in SCL blocks.<br/><br/>- it also turns out that our current case bears more than a few elements in common (aka: fucking exact match) with other 4 similar cases ... unresolved ... dating more than 10 years ago.<br/>The squad of Operatives that investigated back then seemed, according to the official records, to not come up with much ... but searching for info on the squad resulted in yet another SLC blockade.<br/><br/>And here we had to close the session :x<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/><b>4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post-Game Thoughts</span></b><br/>The game run smoothly.<br/>The <i>Automatic Opposition</i> produced unexpected twists and we then built upon them, congecturing and making ourself paranoid.<br/>Without any conscious or planned plotting/directing our "easy peasy" investigation took the dark colours of a conspirancy much bigger than us!  :twisted: <br/><br/>It was surprising!<br/>And <b>everything</b> made perfect sense at every step of the way (this is a result of the game-rules in play).<br/><br/>On a side note I, as a veteran SLA player, think that the game felt "<b>very SLA</b>".<br/>I did almost nothing to stir things this way.<br/>I just explained briefly the WoP and its playable races to the other Players... and when they came up with something I slapped a SLA name on it ... so the "<i>police</i>" became "<i><b>Shivers</b></i>", the Xeno's "<i>sniper rifle</i>" became a "<b><i>FEN 30-30 True Shot</i></b>", our "<i>access level</i>" became "<i><b>SCL</b></i>" and the hacking attempt resulted in a nasty "<i><b>D-Notice</b></i>" instead of a more common "<i>Access Denied</i>".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384916/#Comment_384916" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-12T03:17:23+00:00" title="July 12, 2012  3:17AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, just came across Tactical Ops today.
