There barriers to entry are much lower since you can do it in your spare time instead of having to schedule face to face events.<br/><br/>-Because of the way the internet works you can communicate with as few or as many people as you want. This makes it possible to have massive games with dozens of people and makes cross talk much easier than in tabletop.<br/><br/>-Time constraints work out much differently so instead of having to have a lot of rapid back and forth chatter like in tabletop you can have things like people spending hours writing out massive posts that can be anything from describing the actions of their character in short story format or people writing out the entire order of battle of their nation\u2019s military in intricate detail. I think the ability to get into this kind of detail is a real strength of the online medium.<br/><br/>-Complex rules are often easier to manage since you often have a day or so to get back to the GM about what your character is doing instead of seconds or minutes.<br/><br/>Disadvantages:<br/><br/>-High turnover. There is much higher turnover wrt both GMs and players. Because of this making sure that no one person is vital and that GM authority is at least somewhat distributed is important. Because you often don\u2019t personally know the people you\u2019re playing with it is much easier to blow off a game (something I\u2019m as guilty of as anyone).<br/><br/>-Using the standard RPG party of adventurers format is often an exercise in frustration. Everything often has to move at the pace of the slowest player and trying to maintain an initiative order slows things down even more. A single combat can last weeks of real time. Often on the internet the more the party is split up the faster play moves.<br/><br/>-Rules that require a lot of back and forth between various players or GMs don\u2019t work well because they take too long. Some form of scripting (like Burning Wheel) or having everyone\u2019s turns be adjudicated at once (like in Diplomacy, not an RPG, but an awesome game nonetheless) helps with this.<br/><br/>A lot of RPGs that are played online are traditional tabletop games that are played online much the same way that they are played on a tabletop (except muuuuuuch slower, usually with a lot less combat and often with a lot of lengthy literary-style description of what\u2019s going on).<br/><br/>The main alternative (which I THINK is a lot more popular, but it\u2019s hard to measure these sorts of things on the internet) is freeform RPing based on internet forums or list-serves or games that have evolved from that form. Some examples I\u2019ve seen have been freeform geopolitical simulators, cooperative fiction writing, freeform Populus-style god games, etc. etc.<br/><br/>The basic idea is that each person controls one character and they can describe their character doing whatever they like as long as it doesn\u2019t conflict with what someone else says. If a group has a good Social Contract this can work surprisingly well and there\u2019s less \u201cwell my character just got elected King of the World!\u201d or \u201cI shot you\u201d \u201cWell the bullet bounced off!\u201d \u201cNo it didn\u2019t!\u201d than you\u2019d think. What often happens is that people go out of their way to avoid direct conflict with other Players, which works but can be a bit boring.<br/><br/>Often gaming groups of this sort go from being completely freeform to having a Black Box GM. In this system, each player says what they\u2019re trying to do and the GM says what the result is. Everything being up to the GM can lead to some problems however, the most notable being GM burnout which often kills of this kind of game. Another way to get around the problems of freeform is to write up a set of detailed rules. In the cases of this that I\u2019ve experienced the game went from being a very freeform anything goes Geopolitical RPing game (each Player was a ruler of a different country) to being more of a Play By Email Board Game (like Diplomacy, which again, is an awesome game but not an RPG). All of the long posts people liked writing (for example maintaining daily newspapers for their country) went from being the heart of the game to fluff that had nothing to do with what was actually going on in terms of the rules.<br/><br/>So how would you go about making a game that takes the best elements of tabletop gaming with some of the good elements of freeform internet gaming? The only criterion is that it has to be as internet-friendly as possible.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180177/#Comment_180177" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T01:34:00+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  1:34AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here\u2019s my very simplistic crack at it (the rules are based loosely on the PTA fan mail mechanic):<br/><br/>1. Game play starts with Canon being defined. This could be something like \u201cthe world as it existed in 1,000\u201d or \u201cthe Harry Potter universe at the beginning of the first book\u201d or something more nebulous.<br/><br/>2. People decide what sorts of characters are appropriate and each player makes a Character. Depending on the game, the Character could be a single normal human or an entire species of star-faring aliens or anything in between. Characters have no stats.<br/><br/>3. Each player (except possibly new players or people who are short on time) would also be responsible for an element of Canon. How Canon is divided up depends on the game. For example a game set in the single city could have each Player be in charge of the Canon for a neighborhood. Canon could also be divided up thematically into things like The Natural World, Government, Military, Magic, etc. They are in charge of maintaining, coming up with details for and generally being the GM of that slice of Canon.<br/><br/>4. As long as players don\u2019t come into Conflict with each other or try to change some element of Canon, players can post anything they want and no rules apply. For example if your Character is hanging out in a bar and talking to people things just go freeform, a Character tries to kill a Canonical NPC, then the rules kick in.<br/><br/>5. Whichever Player started the Conflict then writes up a post that sets the scene and says what will happen (in general terms) if they win the scene. The person on the other side of the Conflict (another Character or a player in charge of the relevant slice of Canon) then writes another post that outlines the difficulties that the character that started the conflict faces and says what will happen (in general terms) if the character who started the Conflict loses the Conflict (so stakes are set). A Player can only be involved in one Conflict at a time.<br/><br/>6. All players start with a certain number of Tokens. To initiate a conflict you have to spend one Token. Every time they read a write-up of a Conflict (see 5 above) Players can spend one (and only one) of their Tokens by voting for one side or another of the Conflict (you can\u2019t vote for yourself). After a certain amount of time has passed the side of the Conflict that gets the most votes collects all of the Tokens (including the one that the person who initiated the conflict spent) and writes up a post that narrates how the Conflict is resolved that is in line with what they wrote before when stakes were being set (see 5 above). If a person runs out of Tokens then their character can\u2019t do much, but they can still win Tokens through their roles as \u201cguy in charge of a certain element of Canon.\u201d So there is a strong incentive not to write up ridiculous thing that get people to vote against you since that will make you run out of Tokens eventually.<br/><br/>7. So in order to get a big pile of Tokens, you need to start interesting conflicts that enough people care about to vote about and then win the conflict. To win a conflict what you need to do is convince the players in general that the resolution to the conflict that you envision makes more sense or is more awesome by whatever standards the players in general want to judge according to. One good way of convincing people that your vision makes sense is to base it on Canon or on the results of previous conflicts and to avoid shooting too high.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>Player starts a conflict with \u201cMy Character becomes a Third Party candidate for governor of Illinois\u201d And they write up a fun post describing the course of their election campaign and maybe write up their stump speech.<br/><br/>The Player in charge of the relevant bit of Canon (maybe political Canon girl, or the guy in charge of the Canon of the Midwest) then writes up a post about the difficulties that that Character faces and what their opponents are up to.<br/><br/>The Player then has an incentive to not shoot too high while setting the Stakes. If they say \u201cI win 99% of the vote\u201d then people will vote them down with Tokens and they\u2019ll lose. But if they say something like \u201cI win 20% of the vote, and even though I\u2019m not elected I\u2019ve now got great name recognition and I\u2019ve got a big fundraising and volunteer rolodex\u201d they\u2019re much more likely to win the Conflict since people will think that\u2019s more reasonable. Then in later Conflicts they could bring up those things in order to convince people that there\u2019s a basis for them winning the Conflict (in future elections for example). Basically precedent is your friend.<br/><br/>What this does is have very freeform rules that turn the player base in general into a black box that generates results, while encouraging people to be reasonable with the sort of things they write up.<br/><br/>8. The rules can easily be extrapolated to three-way (or more) conflicts. If two Characters are allied they can work together on one side of a Conflict and beg for Tokens together.<br/><br/>9. Stats could be added as a way to make Characters better at some Conflicts than others. Just add or subtract the relevant stat to the vote total.<br/><br/>This is of course a very skeletal set of rules. Any additions or changes people can think up?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180216/#Comment_180216" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T07:54:11+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  7:54AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would change the canon molding bit, One of the aspects of the internet is the facelessness and lack of immediate feedback. You can tell when your in real life and people are getting a groove on to your suggestions, not so on the internet, which leads to frustration , lack of cohesion, and loss of time (developing ideas that would not make it past the first sentence in real life) .  Lack of canon also doesn't help express what the game is or should be about which combined with the lack of face to face leads to aforementioned frustration and lack of cohesion from my personal experiance. <br/><br/>also the whole, <br/><br/>-Using the standard RPG party of adventurers format is often an exercise in frustration. Everything often has to move at the pace of the slowest player and trying to maintain an initiative order slows things down even more. A single combat can last weeks of real time. Often on the internet the more the party is split up the faster play moves.<br/><br/>I disagree with, the real problem is trying to pust standard tactical TABLETOP rpg elements . I dont think the problem is trying to have a rogue, priest, fighter, and mage, all trying to do something together, but rather trying to have tactical options (that generally rely on mini's and layout that is NOT easy to communicate, try running 4th with a bunch of people who are gung ho about the tactics and a group that is willing to step back from it I find leads to much different speed (like by a factor of 10, once i got the autoflanks, and only monsters provoke oppurtunity attacks rules down). Splitting the party up even if it saves waiting time, costs more other time, making new threads, formating posts, managing information that also has to be considered. <br/><br/>The Rules/Game may matter but I really don't think the mechanic does, whether begging tokens, blind bids, rolling for matches, over under, consulting a table, percentile, etc. This is something that I feel you can save time on, especially if you allow the person to do it in RL as much as possible. I find its only when it comes to vetting dicerollers that this aspect ever really began to ground. <br/><br/>all that said, I think I'm coming at the opposite angle of this than others, I have played a fair ammount of trad rpg's over forums and pbp to varying degree's of success. I find these games require more or less the same things that rl games require. Agreement to the purpose of play, Abiding by the unspoken rules of play, and lots and lots of play.<br/><br/>If I was going to come up with a sample, something like with a skills/talent divide. <br/><br/>Skills are more or less anything from statish things (Strength ) to skillish things (Kung Fu) and are defined by the player and expressed as a percentile. <br/>Stacking Skills result in checks against any and all appropiate skills (or perhaps just 2 if your looking to cap it or something )any success = success. <br/><br/>If you wanted to get all indie and give narration rights with failure so it stings less be my guess. <br/><br/>Talenst are wierd abilities ( I can fly) to objects ( I have a largo sticker and a trunk full of illegal guns , to steal something ) and for the mostpart just work, althought may be linked to a skill if required for dice stuff , coming below<br/><br/>dicestuff works like this, unless someone cares, its roll under percentile (which with the multible checks on related skills results in a pretty good sucess rate) if its a talent it just works. IF someone cares you have to roll off, percentiledice+your percentile score, whoever is highest wins. if the loser has other relavent skills, they can try them, greatest number of wins/losses takes the match.<br/><br/>Throw in some colour requirements (probably in the form of racial talents or tech talents for fantasy or sci fi respectively )and you have a pretty good basis. This is all looking back kinda horribly ripped off the 4 colour system. <br/><br/>and I would probably limit unopposed skill checks to 2, and matches to 3 wins, <br/><br/>just my quick ass internet playbypost system. <br/><br/>Logos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180281/#Comment_180281" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T12:06:33+00:00" title="November 25, 2008 12:06PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In answering this question I always point to <a href="http://www.skyseastone.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Phases/MainPage" rel="nofollow">Phases of Tir na Nog'th (a farce, with knives)</a>, a wiki Amber game I played in a while back. <br/><br/>Because it was based around characters who could retcon reality a bit, the wiki format fitted well. A lot of the time, we were in separate scenes or two people in one scene, and we could do a bit of back-and-forth (we had an email list where we did OOC chat and alerted each other when we'd posted). If there were more than two people in a scene, the rule was that you were allowed one update per day.<br/><br/>There were about 4 Americans, a woman in the Netherlands and me in New Zealand. We had sufficient time zone overlap that it worked out.<br/><br/>What finally killed it was that the GM got busy IRL. I think if authority had been split up more, as you suggest above - say, one person in charge of Chaos, another of Amber, a third of Tir na Nog'th, a fourth of the Greatmoon shadow - it might have lasted longer. We did a little of that towards the end but there was still a strong central GM and when he was no longer available the game ended.<br/><br/>We did adopt a system of stats partway through, but they were more indicative than mechanical. It was like, "I have a 15 in Obsessed with Getting Benedict's Approval, so I think my character would do this," or "I have a 20 in Shaman, so my character should be able to do that."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180295/#Comment_180295" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T13:34:49+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  1:34PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The great advantage of online games is that you can have lots of people involved, and you can play with lots of people you wouldn't normally get to.<br/><br/>The great disadvantage of online games is that quite often, you discover that there are reasons why these people aren't playing RPGs face-to-face.<br/><br/>I played in more "freeform" PBEM and play-by-post RPGs than I can easily count, over a period of several years.  Here's some of the things that tend to go awry, which (IMHO) any good system for them will have to help the players deal with:<br/><br/>1 - Pointless scenes and/or scenes that run on too long.  These happen because of a lack of any scene framing mechanics that explicitly tell people when to end a scene (e.g., "when all conflicts are resolved" or that give explicit permission to "skip the dull stuff".  Quite often in a game like this, the players (through their characters) will agree to do something -- e.g., leave the place they've met up and go investigate the spooky warehouse.  However, instead of cutting off the scene and jumping to arriving at or already being in the warehouse, the game will ramble on, with people roleplaying going out to the car, starting it up, driving over there, etc.<br/><br/>Alternately, people often roll on to the next thing in logical temporal order, regardless of whether it's interesting or not.  I can't tell you how many Harry Potter games I've been in where a nighttime scene will be wrapped up, and someone immediately starts a breakfast scene -- not because there's a dramatic reason to, but simply because it's the next thing they can think of that should happen in temporal order.<br/><br/>2 - Mary-Sue characters.  For those unfamiliar with the term, a Mary-Sue is a character put into a story who has no faults and is uber-competent, often in many different fields.  In a Buffy RPG my wife played in once, one of the players started off playing the group's Watcher -- who was then revealed to also be an ex-Marine, to have a PhD in Psychology, to be extremely rich (owning multiple homes and dozens of cars), to have a secret occult library.... well, you get the picture.  <br/><br/>Given unlimited character creation abilities, some people will take advantage, and a few will take extreme advantage.<br/><br/>(A related problem is the premise-violating character.  In almost every Harry Potter game, for example, there's someone who wants to play a character who *also* survived an attack by Voldemort.... or wants to play a character who's Harry's other cousin, who nobody knew about until now.)<br/><br/>3 - Players who won't ever let their character lose a conflict.  Without conflict resolution rules, some players will simply "refuse to lose", going on and on with "... but that doesn't work because ..." responses to anything that could have what they consider a negative effect on their character.<br/><br/>4 - Over-posting and under-posting players.  A player who only posts once every couple of weeks is one kind of problem.  A player who posts every ten minutes is another -- and two or three of the latter can quickly overrun a game and prevent anyone else from having meaningful input, if allowed.  Be aware as well that some of the latter type will try to work around a restriction on how often they're allowed to post by doing "joint posts" -- that is, carrying out their own exchange with another player via email, IM, or some other means outside the game, then posting the result of that as "their post for the day" or such.<br/><br/>5 - Player cliques.  There are people who will join a game in a group of two or three people -- and then some or all of that group will ignore everyone else in the game, and only post in scenes with their clique.<br/><br/>A gamemaster can work around all of these problems, but adding in a gamemaster creates its own problems -- the GM can become a bottleneck.  Over-controlling GMs seem to be a common problem in freeform RPGs as well, and GMs can be part of a clique.  (IMHO, a big part of the problem is that the people who have the most free time to play in online RPGs, while having the least money to use their free time for other pursuits, are often high-school or college-aged... and so they often bring the social baggage of those age groups along.)<br/><br/>So, the big things I see a system designed for this sort of play needing are:<br/><br/> - Strong scene-framing rules, to prevent pointless scenes and scenes that last past their useful life.<br/><br/> - Some sort of character-creation limits, to prevent Mary-Sues.  (E.g., even something as simple as "pick three positive traits and one negative trait.")<br/><br/> - Conflict-resolution rules, to prevent "refusing to lose".<br/><br/> - Rules to limit over-posting, and keep under-posting from bogging down the game.<br/><br/> - Rules to help break up cliques.  This is the one I have no good ideas on how to do.  Maybe some sort of rewards for posting with a variety of players?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180408/#Comment_180408" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T02:39:55+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  2:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Logos7: We\u2019re coming at this from different directions but I think that face to face and via e-mail/forum posting as such different mediums that what works best for one is pretty different than what works best for the other. Of course you CAN play a traditional RPG in a traditional way over the internet and make it rock, but I don\u2019t think that that takes advantage of one of the best aspects of online play: namely that people have TIME to do write up all kinds of awesome things that there just isn\u2019t time for in a face to face game in which people have to keep things moving.<br/><br/>\u201cand I would probably limit unopposed skill checks to 2, and matches to 3 wins, \u201c<br/>Wouldn\u2019t having to do a couple different rolls for the same basic challenge slow things down a lot?<br/><br/>MikeRM:<br/><br/>The way that Wiki is set up seems very cool; I think it would work for the same that I sketched out in the second post of the thread as well\u2026<br/><br/>\u201cWhat finally killed it was that the GM got busy IRL.

It\u2019s much harder to partition off a chunk of time to do online gaming (which you have to keep up with day in and day out) than face to face gaming (which you can limit to one time slow every other week).<br/><br/>\u201cWe did adopt a system of stats partway through, but they were more indicative than mechanical.

Here's some of the things that tend to go awry, which (IMHO) any good system for them will have to help the players deal with\u201d<br/><br/>The freeform games I played (mostly \u201ceveryone\u2019s a ruler of a country\u201d games) sound pretty different from yours, but the same sort of issues crop up in both, which leads me to think that the solutions are pretty similar.<br/><br/>\u201c1 - Pointless scenes and/or scenes that run on too long.\u201d<br/>Right, I think a good solution for this is \u201cyou can blather on about your breakfast as long as you like, but the rules only kick in and other people only have to actually care about what you say if some kind of Conflict crops up.\u201d And then define Conflict in game terms in a way that makes sense.<br/><br/>\u201c2 - Mary-Sue characters.\u201d Right, in a completely freeform or consensus-based game there\u2019s no way to get rid of Mary Sue characters. And let me tell you, in geopolitical freeform games Mary Sue Countries are a true horror to behold. For example the person who unified Sub Saharan Africa into a First World Nation or the person who made Brazil such a great country that Israel joined it voluntarily.<br/><br/>I THINK the rules I sketched out in which conflict resolution is done by people voting with tokens and then the winner of the conflict getting the keep the tokens would get around this problem. It would allow people to write up characters that are as Mary Sue-ish as they want, but that character would still lose every single conflict through bad luck or whatever unless they could do it in a way that wouldn\u2019t piss off the rest of the players.<br/><br/>\u201c3 - Players who won't ever let their character lose a conflict.\u201d Yes, because of this there needs to be some sort of Conflict resolution mechanic, no matter how fuzzy or bare-bones. The danger here is building up the sort of conflict resolution mechanic that turns the whole game from being focused on RPing to basically a board game (I\u2019ve seen that happen in the geopolitical freeform games I used to play).<br/><br/>\u201c4 - Over-posting and under-posting players.\u201d Right, however over-posting isn\u2019t a problem unless what\u2019s happening in the posts affects the other characters, otherwise everyone can skim it. So what you need to limit is how much a character can do, not how much a player can write.<br/><br/>\u201c5 - Player cliques.\u201d I don\u2019t see this as a big problem, if players go off an make a clique and do stuff that doesn\u2019t affect anyone else, then everyone else can just ignore them, so they don\u2019t bother anyone.<br/><br/>\u201cA gamemaster can work around all of these problems, but adding in a gamemaster creates its own problems -- the GM can become a bottleneck.\u201d<br/><br/>Right, having the game rules be simply: \u201cyou say what you do and the GM says what happens as a result\u201d is problematic. I\u2019ve been on both sides of that divide\u2026<br/><br/>\u201c- Strong scene-framing rules, to prevent pointless scenes and scenes that last past their useful life.<br/><br/>- Some sort of character-creation limits, to prevent Mary-Sues. (E.g., even something as simple as "pick three positive traits and one negative trait.")<br/><br/>- Conflict-resolution rules, to prevent "refusing to lose".<br/><br/>- Rules to limit over-posting, and keep under-posting from bogging down the game.<br/><br/>- Rules to help break up cliques. This is the one I have no good ideas on how to do. Maybe some sort of rewards for posting with a variety of players?\u201d<br/><br/>I agree about most of this. However I don\u2019t think that there needs to be especially strict character-creation limits as long as there are conflict-resolution rules. After all if someone makes a ridiculous character and doing so makes them loose all of their conflicts, then problem solved.<br/><br/>How would you propose implementing those fixeds?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180438/#Comment_180438" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T08:21:12+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  8:21AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daztur: Yes we are coming at this from different angles. While there are multible rolls, everything but interpersonal comflict can be done in one post (2 rolls, one post) . Interpersonal conflict on the other hand requires responce (so that both people can be involved and have an oppurtunity to do things) and that's why yes i do want it to slow down there. <br/><br/>efindel: I agree with a lot of what you said, but some things im not convinced over<br/><br/><br/>So, the big things I see a system designed for this sort of play needing are:<br/><br/>- Strong scene-framing rules, to prevent pointless scenes and scenes that last past their useful life. <br/><br/>I'm iffy on this one, because quite frankly big sprawling and useless scenes or many of them are something an internet game can have in abundance and not nearly be as terrible in real life. There is no limited amount of scenes nor do big sprawling scenes require nearly as much attention from others as they do in RL. <br/><br/>- Some sort of character-creation limits, to prevent Mary-Sues. (E.g., even something as simple as "pick three positive traits and one negative trait.")<br/><br/>Agreed<br/><br/>- Conflict-resolution rules, to prevent "refusing to lose".<br/><br/>Agreed<br/>- Rules to limit over-posting, and keep under-posting from bogging down the game.<br/><br/>My Focus would be more on the second but roughly agreed<br/><br/>- Rules to help break up cliques. This is the one I have no good ideas on how to do. Maybe some sort of rewards for posting with a variety of players?<br/><br/>This depends alot I think on what your doing, and it seems much more like a social good than a good for the game kinda goal. This seems both hard to impliment, hard on the story, and hard to adjucate. Not sure if its a good idea or bad idea. <br/><br/>also as far as the making of a ridiculous character that makes them loose all their conflicts, its not problem solved. A game depends on its players succeeding, a player who is not succeeding is either going to be Trouble or Leave. If you wanted them as a player in the first place you should want them to stay therefore in order to help them stay we prevent character traps that would make them loose all chance of succeeding. <br/><br/>You can say all you want, I know people who don't want to succeed and make these kinds of character, its not that they don't want to succeed, its that they are defining success differently for themselves, that's trouble because i guess to put it in forge speak, its a divergent creative agenda. This is my own experiance with it.<br/><br/>So going over what has been posted so far we are at: <br/><br/>Scene Ending Rules<br/>Character Creation Limits<br/>Conflict Resolution Rules ( Perhaps even Task Resolution Rules as required and to taste), Perferibly Quick or able to be done in one post<br/>Posting Moderation Rules<br/>Fair Play/Good Sportsmanship Rules (everyone play nicely with each other)<br/>A way of dealing with High Turnover ( either distributed authority, or enpowering a figure who wont turnover)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180552/#Comment_180552" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T21:24:33+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  9:24PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So far no one has said anything about the whole MUSH community, which seems odd.

For example "you can define your character however you like, but describing your character in Mary Sue terms won't help you win conflicts." <br/><br/>Also I think something that is necessary is some way of tracking what is "real" in the setting, either through a Wiki or something like that. I think that a good way to do this is slicing GM responsibility so that a collection of different people are in charge of a different slice of reality each which some kind of coordination between them.<br/><br/>And finally if you want the freeform forum Roleplay "feel" to predominate (it really is quite different than a table top "feel") you have to make the style and writing quality of people's posts matter more than juggling with numbers. For example if you have people narrate what they do and then translate that into crunch terms, you soon stop getting the sort of details narratives that make freeform roleplaying fun. What I'd like is for the narration to matter in crunch terms, at the very least through some kind of Stunt system (i.e. describe what you're doing in a cool way and get a bonus) or have your narrated posts basically BE the crunch (i.e. have you succeed or fail based on how awesome and well-written your posts are, not on what your character stats are).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180678/#Comment_180678" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-28T14:30:51+00:00" title="November 28, 2008  2:30PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2008 2:33PM by JuddG.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180738/#Comment_180738" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-28T21:11:44+00:00" title="November 28, 2008  9:11PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wouldn't that result in a lot of players being glued to the screen hitting refresh every 10 minutes? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180739/#Comment_180739" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-28T21:38:29+00:00" title="November 28, 2008  9:38PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a good mod of that unaris rule would be to be that only the first person to post after the GM could hack the post.

That being said, retooling for a slower feedback loop is a bit of a head-scratcher if the idea is to discourage predatory lurking.

It's worth remembering that most collaborative efforts on the internet end in failure, because starting a collaborative project is so ridiculously cheap and easy.  You basically get failure for free: with so little invested, everyone is free to try just about anything and then walk away from it whenever they want.<br/><br/>That's both a curse and a blessing, of course.  The curse is, well, lots and lots of failure.  The blessing is that you don't lose anything you weren't already willing to give away for free, so you can afford to just keep failing until you get lucky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
