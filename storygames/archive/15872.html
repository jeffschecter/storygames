So far, I know that aliens came and we stole their awesome technology, used it to kill each other, and now they're back with a vengeance. Or something. And I get to be an AI. Over Skype. And hopefully I can find a voice-changing software that will make me sound like a speak-and-spell, or a multi-voiced robot, or something awesome like that. Anyone have any experience with this game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360490/#Comment_360490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-18T23:03:52+00:00" title="February 18, 2012 11:03PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2012 11:09PM by thadrine.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just got done reading it last night, I really like it.

Yes, while reading the game I felt that there were all sorts of little "bits" that were missing, that would have made a big difference in the end. Over all though, it has made me skip over the other games I was interested in running and choose this one. <br/><br/>First off watch John's videos about the game.  <br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-bZh5jEKDhgg?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZh5jEKDhgg"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/bZh5jEKDhgg/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-kwGKyPwdK9Q?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwGKyPwdK9Q"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/kwGKyPwdK9Q/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-5V9hsf_Y0J8?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V9hsf_Y0J8"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/5V9hsf_Y0J8/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-fYte2uZtqZU?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYte2uZtqZU"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/fYte2uZtqZU/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-86JL6Uy87V8?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86JL6Uy87V8"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/86JL6Uy87V8/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>Ok, there is a lot here, but I get bored at lunch and need something to watch. <br/><br/>Basic concept. The game is broken up into three different eras, each one is different in setting and even mechanics, though the basic resolution system stays the same. <br/>Age 1 <br/>Aliens attack, we lose bad, until we steal there tech, we built mechs, and AI ! We can now fight back.... <br/>Age 2<br/>We are a bunch of jerks with big toys, and start running a muck. <br/>Age 3<br/>The aliens come back...<br/><br/>Mechanics<br/>Get a mission from the GM, players add elements to the mission (if you have played wilderness of mirrors it is just like that)<br/>Players play through the mission, and....well.....you know<br/><br/>Rolling<br/>Roll a pool of d10's (from stat and specialties, and misc) , evens are successes, higher rolls are also better for certain effects, if you get enough successes you get privilege, more success means more "effect (damage, narration, other combat effects)" , every round the level of "effect" increases by 1.<br/><br/>Players can, and will, create multiple characters such as various support units, the AI, the engineer, and the secretive operative that creates player tension. <br/>Also, in a mech you can have three people all working together to run one mech. The engineer, the AI, and the pilot. In our first little demo we discovered it was best to have each person play at least 2-3 characters, and make those players to your left run the AI, and the right be your Engineer. <br/><br/>Anyway, the game is really cool and has a great mix of "Story Game" mechanics and tactical mechanics. If the concept of a gritty, strategic, mecha, sci fi game appeals to you then you will love it. <br/><br/>Also, the game is $5 on John's website, go pick it up. It is rather short (large spaced lines), I was able to read through it in a single evening after dinner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360509/#Comment_360509" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T06:15:19+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  6:15AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2012 6:15AM by UserClone.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's like a nod to Bliss Stage.
