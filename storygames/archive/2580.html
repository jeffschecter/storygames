These are three conventions held in Los Angeles: OrcCon over Presidents' Day Weekend, Gamex over Memorial Day Weekend, and Gateway over Labor Day Weekend. This past OrcCon was my time at the RPG helm, and while it went pretty well, I've got bigger plans. I've heard all sorts of great things about Dreamation, and I really wanted to try to make it out there this year. Sadly, it didn't happen. So what I want to know it, what makes Dreamation so awesome for Story Games folks, and what I can I do to replicate that in LA? Granted, there are a lot geographic issues that I probably can't overcome, but I do at least want to give it a go. So, East Coast Story Gamers, what do I need to know?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>--Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59141/#Comment_59141" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T19:09:55+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  7:09PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dreamation staff give us free room and board, free place to sell our games outside of the stuffy, moribund dealer's hall (and near where RPGs are played), and free space to play games and socialize.<br/><br/>Since you're on the west coast, you might want to consider getting a big name amongst game designers (Vincent, Ron, Luke, someone else) and paying some or all of their travel costs, also.<br/><br/>If you build it, we will come.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59142/#Comment_59142" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T19:39:13+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  7:39PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The freebies are symptoms of the greater phenomenon:  Double Exposure, from Rebecca and Vinnie on down to the most junior staff members on crowd control, each and every staff member acts as if their reason for being at the convention is to make it great for us, personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI <b>cannot possibly overstate</b> how different that is from convention experiences I have had elsewhere ... even conventions that called me up and asked me specifically and by name to attend.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many flashy things that I use to give people an instant sense that Double-Ex rocks (as, indeed, they do!) but it's the continuous buoying effect of the <i>attitude</i> that makes it work, more than the high points of specific great service.  For instance, every single time I've gone to one of their conventions, I have had at least one (and often several) incident of a staff member coming up to me and saying, with a look of grave and personal concern, "You <b>do</b> know where the con suite is, right?  Because they have food for you.  You've got to eat, remember!"  This is the attitude of someone who will be <i>personally hurt</i> if I don't know where to go to get free food.  I suppose they might be faking it, but if they are then the Double-Ex crew should turn their talents to movie-making, because that'd be an incredible pool of acting talent.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately ... I'm not sure I know what to tell you, in terms of advice for how to bottle that kind of lightning.

Folks who love indie games cannot help but rub shoulders with the folks who make the games.  Small press publishers meet one another face to face, play each other's games, pass the enthusiasm around, and generally network the hell out of it.  This is in large part due to two factors:<br/><br/>1) The IPR booth sits right outside where all of the non-RPGA non-LARP gaming happens -- outside of the dealer's hall. It becomes THE place where the small press crowd (designers and fans) congregate, acting as a social nexus.  I unreservedly suggest that you need IPR or an IPR surrogate (EndGame?) to pull a similar act in a similar locale to help turn StrategiCon into what you're after.<br/><br/>2) The Indie Games Explosion.  There is an incredible, focused, concerted effort, supported by the small press publishers, fans, and the convention organizers themselves, to make sure that there's a TON of indie RPG events going on in every timeslot.  At Dreamation, we pretty much dwarfed the non-indie play in terms of number of events (I could be exaggerating, but this is how I remember it), and at DexCon IGE ensures a very large showing as well.

And other people will want to sell their games.  So that's obviously cool.  But what about all those games that are made by people on the freakin' east coast?  They're not going to show up.  Why should you sell those too?  Well, first, because it makes your booth more of a destination, which lets you sell more games.  And second, because you talk to those guys and convince them to sell you some stock of their games at a retailer discount, and then you pocket the profit."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Now why would anyone <i>but you</i> want to help sell those games, if you're pocketing all the profit?  Because they're happy to do that in order to NOT BE THE ONE WHO ORGANIZES SHIT.  So if you're the one who organizes shit then you get to walk away from the convention with a pocket full of twenties.

We play games in small conference rooms, usually one game to a room.  This is, in my august opinion, <em>fantastic</em> and I can't stand the "Gen Con" way with a big room filled with many different games.  This also means, however, that there's no easy choke-point where you can place a table that all roleplayers will pass by.<br><br>That said, I'd be all over a "publisher's booth" or something similar that would allow those of us running our games to offer them for sale.  Last con I coordinated with Seth, who had a booth for his store; John took out a booth of his own.  It sort of annoys me that I'm not allowed to sell my books when I'm running the same games.  With only one title currently, I'm not going to sell enough to recoup booth costs.  John could pull it off because he's got a whole line of books, but I'm not there yet.  Also note, I don't even really want a sales venue in order to make gobs of money -- I just want to run a game and when somebody says, "How do I get that?" I can get them a copy.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59849/#Comment_59849" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T06:10:00+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  6:10AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would definitely be open to working out some sort of West Coast IPR rep and booth at these cons.

Since you can only pre-register for one game per day, you pretty much guarantee that the RPG gamers are going to pass by that spot every time they need to sign up for a game that they didn't pre-register for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if the hotel will allow it or not, but you could also put racks by the windows when people come out of the elevators on the 4th floor.  There is also a hallway that the gamers must pass through on the way to their game, turn one of the rooms near the elevator into a sales spot.  Another possibility is the space near RPG headquarters that leads to the outside (where they normally put the water), you could also use that as sales space and that would be particularly effective if you put the Indie RPG games down the hallway on that side.  I think those are something you could check out (depending upon how the hotel and the fire marshal feels about the spots).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sorry I missed Orccon in February, I hope the turnout was good.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
