You sit out of the game until you\u2019ve written up a new character for yourself.

Download it for free, playtest it, give me feedback. If it's broken, give me a fix for it. <br/><br/>Let me take it a stage further now. The idea is for it to stay freely downloadable and if you write something that ends up being used, you get credited for it as a contributor or co-author of this free project.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to sell anyone on anything. I absolutely refuse to be fake or disingenuous about where I stand on gaming styles. It's only fair to tell people that this game is coming from someone who maybe doesn't know how to appeal to the gamers it's aimed at because he's not really one of them. But just because this isn't my preferred style, doesn't mean I can't try to understand what people are looking for from this kind of game or have ideas that some people might like. And if I do, where else shall I share them but here?<br/><br/>This is coming from someone who recently rated a Mouse Guard game 7.75/10 on an <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=14190" rel="nofollow">AP thread</a> and a Beat to Quarters game 8.5/10 on the same thread. Knowing what I like best doesn't make me closed-minded and doesn't stop me having some kind of fun with other stuff.<br/><br/>And what does whether I class it as a roleplaying game or not have to do with the price of milk?

Someone who doesn't care about immersion comes up with ideas about immersion, I listen to them and think about it because immersion matters to me. Anything that helps me get a better handle on it is a good thing. It's my choice to do so; I don't have to. It's not their entitlement. It's just something that happens to suit me. The fact they don't care about immersion doesn't necessarily mean they haven't got something interesting to say about it.<br/><br/>And in a way, me putting this PDF out there is me asking you guys a question:- have I got the point of it? After all, if I have, it'll be easier for me to explain it to other people who think like me.<br/><br/>Besides, it might be exaggerating a little to say I don't care about it at all. I'm toying with plans to try this out with a particular gamer who might enjoy it more than the other stuff she gets to play. It might not be my personal preferred style but that doesn't mean that people I care about won't enjoy it, and why shouldn't I do stuff for them and not just for me?

Hell, just calling it Chiefs would have been eyebrow raising but adding the "no Indians" made me head desk.<br/><br/>Honestly.</blockquote>\nWell Jonathan, that has me utterly bemused. In England where I live, as far as I understand these things anyway, the expression "too many chiefs and not enough Indians" is just about as bland and neutral an expression as you can get. Sure, it has its roots in a culturally different past. But there are plenty of expressions that have far more questionable roots that people use all the time, such as "call a spade a spade" [which is pretty repugnant if you analyse it carefully enough], and people - nice, tolerant, liberal, politically correct, open-minded people - honestly don't bat an eyelid about either of those two expressions. To be honest I'm not aware that there's any negative connotation at all in the phrase "too many chiefs and not enough Indians". It's just a way of saying "too many bosses and not enough feet on the shop floor". I'm not aware of it being connected to any negative stereotypes about anyone's culture. To be honest I probably shouldn't have bothered with the disclaimer but, there you have it, it's as simple as that. Over here people still talk about Cowboys and Indians, and they mean nothing by it; obviously only in certain contexts, because if we're talking about serious history or modern day topics, people will talk about Native Americans or use the names of specific ethnic groups. I'm sorry if you think my country is backward in that respect, assuming (from your phrase "First Nations", which is fairly alien to me) that you're from the Americas yourself, but there you have it.<br/><br/>What the game's name CHIEFS is a jokey allusion to, apart from being an acronym, is that from a trad-tribalistic perspective [using "tribe" strictly in the modern day sociological sense, e.g. the "tribe" of goths or emos or storygamers or trad gamers or whatever] the game is essentially four people fighting over who gets to GM. So really it's a joke at gamers' expense (which gamers depends on your perspective; I suppose it could be either storygamers or trad gamers depending on how sophisticated an analysis you posit). If the expression derives from some vicious prejudice I'm blissfully unaware of, tell me the etymology of it and I'll think it over.<br/><br/>To be clear, I'm not aware of any stereotype to the effect that Native Americans are any more prone than anyone else to having top-heavy hierarchies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397516/#Comment_397516" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T14:34:28+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  2:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2012 2:47PM by omnifray.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Did Omnifray wear a bacon necklace or something?</blockquote>\nWay over my head... unless you're alluding to something quite ridiculous from a certain other gaming forum, of course...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan" title="Jonathan"><img alt="Jonathan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">Jonathan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397522/#Comment_397522" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T15:40:31+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  3:40PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *sigh* <br/><br/>I understand the expression. I understand it's meaning. You clearly understood the expression and felt the need to add that one line disclaimer because you clearly understood the meaning. If you didn't think someone might be contemptuous of using even the barest bones of a First Nations (that's how most Indigenous people in Canada prefer to be referred to as) as a skin for a game then it wouldn't be there. <br/><br/>Languages and expressions have a history, this one stems from the colonial contempt that the colonizers had at the way the structural way that a fair number of First Nations ran. They saw too many people talking, and not enough people ruling and came up with that phrases which has stuck around for one reason or another. When you deal with a colonized culture that's trying to be recognized and survive and grow the most damaging thing are those thoughtless words that come back and define a culture just through sheer weight of use. <br/><br/>Ultimately, if there is a cardinal sin in this that would be it the lack of thought.  A lack of thought in the use of words, a lack of though in the effort in playtesting, a lack of thought in a lot of places.\n<blockquote> It doesn't necessarily have Native Americans in it.</blockquote>\nThen why have them?

What I'm trying to tell you is what you take as a throw away phrase, something you don't think is a big deal might actually be a bigger deal than you originally thought.  The best way to avoid anyone thinking that you've got a game that deals with that might be to drop the "and not enough indians" bit. It's not that hard and like you said, your game loses nothing. <br/><br/>Why would I be offended by eco-friendly? It's was amused by that. "Look, it's so eco friendly we're not going to print it and it's in the title." I mean, I don't think it does anything for the game at all, but that doesn't mean it's not funny. <br/><br/>Also in a content note, I like what Jason said.

In other words, whoever wasn\u2019t considered a chief at the Pentagon was said to be an Indian. The article, written by Don Whitehead of the Associated Press, reported the following in part:<br/><br/>The Indians came into being about the time of Pearl Harbor when it seemed everybody around headquarters was the chief of a branch or a section of some sort. The workhorses said: \u201cToo many chiefs and not enough Indians.\u201d<br/><br/>The chief was the man who said to a junior officer: \u201cSee what you can do about this.\u201d<br/><br/>Idiomation was unable to find a published version of this expression prior to this one however for it to be used so openly and easily in a news article from 1951, it is not unreasonable to date this expression back to sometime during WWII.</blockquote>\nFurther research could of course prove this wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
