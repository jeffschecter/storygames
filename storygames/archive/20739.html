I recently translated it to french (for personal use only, I find it easier to browse through a book in my mother tongue) and am slowly convincing my players to give it a shot "after everybody's died" in our LotFP campaign (of course they keep not dying, quite unexpectedly). I really love the simplicity and minimalist approach, and how easy it is to build upon the game ! For exemple, I very quickly put up a Cyberpunk themed variation by replacing the professions and about two traits (Faerie Blood is now Augmented and means you've got high-tech cyber-enhancements, and Faith is now Protection, meaning you've got the backing of a powerful organization like a gang, the mob or a megacorporation).<br/><br/>On the Internet, I've seen only this post aside from the one discussed in previous threads, and it's also quite old : <a href="http://gfbrobot.com/2012/03/10/game-tasting-lotfp-hqrp/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gfbrobot.com/2012/03/10/game-tasting-lotfp-hqrp/</a><br/><br/>Any love left for this or am I way too late?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455602/#Comment_455602" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-15T01:37:59+00:00" title="August 15, 2016  1:37AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not familiar with HQRP at all!

Its structure and system are very, very light, so much that there is no need for numbers on a character sheet (something I really enjoy for some reason). The structure and procedures of play are (as far as I understood) Old-School, meaning you can run it however the hell you want with easy prep (I improvised a little dungeon from the random tables provided in the GM section during chargen, as advised, and it went perfectly well). <br/><br/>I'm not super good at explaining games, and two or three articles here would give you a significantly less awkward run-down on it, so I'll just focus on what I love and stands out for me :<br/><br/>You play regular people. It's as close as it gets to playing 0-level characters in classic D&amp;D without all the (war)gamey trappings of the original game. I like this, because I'm a firm believer that heroes are made, not born (that is, for trad gaming). I like that there are no stats at all on a sheet, only a bunch of words. I like the bestiary which also has no numbers, only a short description for each (classic) monster and a few considerations that the GM uses in play (like "take prisoners" for kobolds or "always hungry" for gobblies(sic)). To me, it really feels like the 1974 version of D&amp;D, including the openness to interpretation of certain sections, with far less cross referencing and brain-memory required to use in a variety of contexts.<br/><br/>Also it has a particularly clear and nice writing style, with a few humorous touches there and there that make it super easy to get into. I can only suggest you read it and see for yourself as it is quite short, and a far better advocate of itself than I am.<br/><br/>Other iterations of HQRP on the Internet<br/>-Someone made a Choose-your-own-adventure type of thing on 4chan's new Quests boards, but it fell flat quite early. It used HQRP.<br/>-I tried to raise interest there in the traditional games section, but again, no success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455606/#Comment_455606" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-15T20:25:05+00:00" title="August 15, 2016  8:25PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't help but wonder why you'd name a game either of those things <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Maybe "High Quality" is a play on "High Fantasy"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455608/#Comment_455608" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-15T21:37:33+00:00" title="August 15, 2016  9:37PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2016 10:43PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

So far so good, but then I start getting confused:<br/><br/>If I have better armour, the rules seem to say that I get another defence die on this roll. But then I seem to have worse odds of hitting ...for being armoured? <br/><br/>The All-Out Attack rules seems to tell me I get two Attack Dice. Is that in addition to rolling the Defence Die? If so, it seems like there's no draw-back for All-Out Attack except that only fearless characters can do it. If not, how do we determine if the strike hits - or is it always certain to hit? <br/><br/>Similarly, if I'm taking defensive action and rolling two Defence Dice - are these added to the Defence die of the monster attacking me to determine if the strike hits? <br/><br/>Perhaps I'm reading this wrong, missing something, or going off an old draft floating around the net.

So tactical considerations in the fiction are a must to beat adversity in this game, but I'd still recommend not getting into a fight you're not sure you're going to win.<br/><br/>To anyone interested : What do you think might need changes to run mass battles using these rules?

Raisin's solution seems to work, to me.<br/><br/>I actually wrote a mass combat system for the game! Since I'm probably never going to publish the expanded text, here it is. It's untested.<br/><br/>Mass Combat for HQRPG<br/><br/>Mass combat is any combat situation in which there are organized units of troops fighting each other, in sizes too large to be dealt with via the standard combat system. Each turn is divided into leadership and action phases.<br/><br/>First, leadership. The leaders on each side announce their orders for the unit that they lead, then must make a roll to determine whether the unit can carry through with the orders. Difficulties as below.<br/><br/>Difficult: Simple orders which the unit has practiced. A trained commander can do this without rolling.<br/>Very Difficult: Simple orders which the unit has not practiced or drilled, complicated orders which they have practiced and drilled.<br/>Astoundingly Difficult: Complicated orders off the cuff, including any orders with a conditional involved (IF they attack you, then trigger the trap).<br/><br/>If the commander fails the roll, the unit mills around and doesn't do anything. It cannot attack this turn, and automatically defends with a roll of 1.<br/><br/>Then, we roll attack and defense, as per normal, with normal modifiers, as appropriate to the situation. Note that creatures which are "too large to effectively deal with" (such as a dragon or giant) may count as a unit for the purposes of mass combat. While we make these modifiers, we take into account the orders given.<br/><br/>Any hits, roll damage to the unit as follows, with standard damage modifiers:<br/>1-3: Rattled<br/>4-5: Routed<br/>6: Destroyed<br/><br/>A rattled unit gets -1 to its command roll next turn. If the command does not require a roll, then this does not matter.<br/><br/>A routed unit is broken and devastated. It no longer functions as a unit unless the commander can rally them, an astoundingly difficult roll.<br/><br/>A destroyed unit is beyond hope. Individuals may survive, but the unit is toast.<br/><br/>Any individual in the unit that we care about (like a PC) should make a test to see if they take a hit. This is difficult in a rattled unit, very difficult in a routed unit, and astonishingly difficult in a destroyed unit. Appropriate traits (coward, veteran) can give bonuses to this. If they take a hit, resolve it as a normal hit.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455751/#Comment_455751" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-23T17:32:38+00:00" title="August 23, 2016  5:32PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Probably needs something about what happens when lines of command are cut and trying to rally a leaderless unit, but I'm sure that an adventurous GM can figure that out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455752/#Comment_455752" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-23T17:51:09+00:00" title="August 23, 2016  5:51PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose I didn't, Raisin.

If there's ever a "Potemkin Principal" it'll look something like that. Ha! <br/><br/>HDRPG plays to this Occam's Razor business well; there's really not much I want to do with the system that warrants significant mechanical additions. <br/><br/>I'm currently mulling over a draft for a Kids do Call of Cthulhu-style adventure using the HQRP. I don't need a "insanity system" over the top of HQRP: I can just make it a type of Injury that player's can receive for a failed roll, letting the fiction define the cause and severity of the madness.<br/><br/>I maybe - <i>maybe</i> - would consider writing some new tables for the fighting rules to work out how a chase-sequence might work (because kids running from things or after them is a pretty central part of the genre), but that's really just altering the colour of the results, not the core 'danger that\u2019s time sensitive' mechanics. <br/><br/>Oh, the project's working title - and you'll like this - is <i>High Quality Spooky Town.</i><br/><br/>(Although it's looking like I needn't bother and just need to pick up the newness that is <i>Bubblegunshoe</i>.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
