So we finish the combat and it takes at least another 15 or 30 minutes.<br/><br/>My thought is this:  <br/><br/>At any point during the combat, one side can offer the other side a deal.  Basically the encounter ends, the PCs win, but in exchange the PCs must expend  resources.  This would be kind of like the encounter bidding done in Beast Hunters, but it happens to end the combat early.<br/><br/>Typically resources that could be bid are:<br/><br/>* Healing Surges<br/>* Hit Points<br/>* Daily Powers<br/>* Magic Item Uses<br/>* Action Points<br/>* Better/Different Magic Item Rewards.<br/><br/>DM says, "We can end this now for 4 Healing Surges and a Daily Power."<br/>PCs could reply "We still have a bunch of encounter powers.  How about 3 Healing Surges and an Action Point."<br/><br/>Then you narrate the rest of the combat showing who gets hurt and which resources are used.<br/><br/>--Thoughts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156553/#Comment_156553" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T18:20:43+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  6:20PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to check out the in-combat Intimidate mechanics.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156554/#Comment_156554" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T18:21:57+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  6:21PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmmm...<br/><br/>I'm wondering if instead, fewer enemies at a higher level would be better?  <br/><br/>I'm totally hearing you, as I've seen the same thing (and watched the same thing happen this weekend to the table playing next to us at CollectiveCon), but I feel like I need a few more sessions under my belt to craft a "hack" that wouldn't shiv the game in the neck somehow.<br/><br/>I haven't DMed yet (only played), but as DM I'd probably end the encounter, and perhaps just turn up the juice a little in the next combat: Probably in the form of area-effect zones and the like that are detrimental to the PCs (slippery areas, mild traps, all on the PC's side of the map)...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156556/#Comment_156556" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T18:32:09+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  6:32PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2008 6:49PM by Callan_S.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does the GM really just want to inflict some damage on you?<br/><br/>If he does, you could just negotiate the entire combat until he's satisfied with the damage inflicted.<br/><br/>I'm inclined to think the GM doesn't just want to inflict some punishment on you, rather he wants to play out the game that combat is, to its proper end. Even if he's likely to lose...though the strong gamble element of D&amp;D does make it possible to win (side note: I know the rolls are basically all averaged out...but luck can even break averages). Much like a problem gambler, in D&amp;D you can always have a demented sense of being able to win (but unlike problem gambling, it's okay to get that feeling since your not going to lose anything big).<br/><br/>I'd suggest adding a beserk condition, where the monsters get plus two to hit, but suffer 1 to 2 hitpoint damage per round (they lose more the higher their CR - work out some equation for it). The beserk condition only occurs when both players and GM both say they want it. Special note: No, that doesn't mean they negotiate when it happens - they just both say yes or no (saying nothing says no) to it each round. That's very different from negotiation. When both happen to say yes, all monsters go beserk as they see their imminent deaths.<br/><br/>That's after guessing what your GM wants. I'm just skeptical about him just wanting to inflict some punishment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156561/#Comment_156561" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T19:10:37+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  7:10PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless the design of adventure/monsters accounts for "fight on to the death", as somone who's GM's for 26 years now, I find "metagaming" by having monsters fight on if they know they've lost and have an alternative - out of some desire to manage resources - to be "poor sport".<br/><br/>Opponents should break and run or offer a deal (if they believe they will be spared) when clearly beaten unless they're zombies or constructs or fanatics etc.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156568/#Comment_156568" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T20:17:29+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  8:17PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2008 8:18PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JudaicDiablo</cite>Then you narrate the rest of the combat showing who gets hurt and which resources are used.</blockquote>\nAhhhh... how quickly they weary of the iron discipline of the battlemap and yearn for the carefree days of their hippy "stor-ee games!"<br/><br/>There is no escape!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156586/#Comment_156586" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T23:41:09+00:00" title="July 14, 2008 11:41PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2008 11:43PM by John_Harper.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't help that they're fighting my fanatical cultists of Vecna and their fearless skeleton agents.

For each encounter you had to choose whether to engage in quick or slow combat.  Slow combat was all terrain, battlemaps, turn-based movement and attacks.  Quick combat just gave you a readout of your characters' health and expendable resources, and those of the monsters, and would quickly resolve.<br/><br/>You never did as well in quick combat as you would've in slow, so it was a tradeoff.  If QC wasn't going the way you expected, you could stop it and go into slow, but then you'd be in worse shape, because your characters would already be wounded and not at all in a good tactical formation.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think some form of QC would be awesome for 4E wrapup.  Bidding would be a great way to handle it, as long as the GM drives a hard bargain.

It certainly is more of a concern in games that have very "balenced" types of set up: D&amp;D, Agon, etc... where the GM is suppose to be working within a frame work. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I see it as a flaw in the design of the game or the encounter... If the GM is unwilling to let the encounter go then there are problems. Games where the GM must buy the right to antagonize the players can have this problem (Agon, though we have yet to run into this, it defineetly could happen). Additionally in games with out morale guidance or tracks "resources," like D&amp;D may run into this because why would you ever run as a GM and lose the investment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the D&amp;D players... is there something that forbids you to run away and attack again later? is it the desire to run set pieces that makes you finish the encounter? why is this even a question? <br/>\n<br/>\n________<br/>\nJason                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156652/#Comment_156652" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T09:58:06+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  9:58AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't say I really recognise the problem.
