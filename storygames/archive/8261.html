Is Sea Dracula what I'm looking for?<br/><br/>Graham</blockquote>\nGraham, yes.<br/><br/>I can back it up with Actual Play examples.<br/><br/>I'd played a game with Jake Richmond the night before. In that game session, I took off my pants. Long story, not relevant to this write-up.<br/><br/>We played Sea Dracula the next day. He told me that he'd offer me a free Lawyer Point if I took off my pants during a dance in Sea Dracula. The other players supported this house rule. I scoffed and said no.<br/><br/>But then the end of the game was approaching. I had the last turn to present an argument. I was down by 2 points. Doing a dance would get me one point. Involving others would get me one more point. But I'd still only be tied for first. There was only one option...<br/><br/>...I would need to drop my pants in order to win the case. And so I did. It was not an honorable moment, but it was a victorious one.<br/><br/>And then, after my turn, we entered endgame. And I found out that having the most Lawyer Points doesn't necessitate winning the game. And it turns out that indeed, I lost. I nearly cried. Most hard-hitting moment ever. Think about the breech of ethics, the abuse of power... followed by the breath-stealing realization that the machine would not yield to anything other than its own contentions. I felt victimized by my own greed.<br/><br/>Sea Dracula meets the requirements outlined in your post, 100%.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181918/#Comment_181918" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T00:31:24+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 12:31AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2008 12:36AM by jake richmond.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Congratulations, Jake.<br/><br/>Could you tell me a bit more about Sea Dracula?

It started as an adaptation of the Hugh Jackman Vanhelsing movie and spent some time as a city building sim before becoming a game about dancing lawyers. All the critical praise it's received was given before it was actually written or published. It's gotten me 2 separate lap dances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181921/#Comment_181921" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T00:56:57+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 12:56AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2008 12:57AM by Joli.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>It's gotten me 2 separate lap dances.</blockquote>\nI was witness to the second. It was glorious.
