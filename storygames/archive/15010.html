I mean, I've willingly shelled out $50-$100 for some of the FFG board games (Arkham Horror, Mansions of Madness, Cadwallon, etc.), but they're putting a LOT of high quality stuff in those boxes, like minis, the boards, cards, counters, etc. And, of course, there was the Mouse Guard box set (*swoons over its greatness*)<br/><br/>But like boxed games such as Dragon Age, the new Gamma World, or even the modern D&amp;D Red Box, it seems unecessary. Most of the time they are using a box to hold multiple booklets that <i>could've</i> been printed as one book. Everything else seems unecessary.<br/><br/>Almost better to sell the game by itself, and offer a download link for PDFs of character sheets and playaids.<br/>I would only consider the box if it needed to include specialized game boards or customized dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341194/#Comment_341194" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T08:32:04+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  8:32AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dice, pencils, pad of character sheets I can manage on my own.

I think Galaxy Truckers and its Big Box expansion is a good value at $120ish. I also think that designer's other major game, Through the Ages, is a bargain at $60ish even though it's "only a card game". But I think stuff like FFG's WoW: The Board Game is a huge waste of $75, even though it's probably got 3x the production cost tied up in it.<br/><br/>That MG box feels to me like a $60ish value. The WFRP 3 box felt like a $50 value, although I think the retail on it was $75 or so. <br/><br/>So...dunno! Indie games usually feel like rough drafts to me so I come to them expecting to pay less. The real standout work -- BW, BE, MG, AW -- in turn feels like a huge bargain. I'd have paid $50ish for an AW box with nice/reuseable color playbooks. But most of what I have feels more like they should be in the $10-15 range (as books not boxes, granted).<br/><br/>Throw a price out there and see what the reaction is. Buyers tend to value expensive stuff more, too, so you're probably better off aiming high.<br/><br/>Can you offer it as a non-boxed product as well, to gauge the public's general reaction to it? I guess I'm thinking about my WFRP experience -- the box drew me in but I had sold it at a pretty deep loss within 3 months. I would not have come in with such raised expectations had it been available as a plain old book-style RPG first.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341198/#Comment_341198" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T08:41:57+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  8:41AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would pay up to $70 (with a few exceptions) if:<br/><br/>- the box included everything I need to play (minus paper and writing implements)<br/>- it includes an array of ready to go scenarios and characters<br/>- it includes easy to use rule references for multiple players<br/>- I could start playing within 1-2 hours of opening the box<br/>- I can read the rules out loud at the table with everyone<br/>- it is a game my friends want to play<br/>- it is a game that has positive reviews<br/>- it is a game I will play at least 8 times<br/>- the components feel worth $70<br/>- I want to support the publisher's / designer's work                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341205/#Comment_341205" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T09:23:04+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  9:23AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I keep thinking a box with front/back art, custom dice, and a pad of character sheets would be a great reward level for a kickstarer.

It really depends on your audience. RPG gamers, in general, consistently overestimate their willingness to shell out for a boxed set. Board gamers are less reluctant.<br/><br/>2. "Everything you need to play" is less of a selling point than you think. RPG gamers don't think in terms of buying something for a whole group the way board gamers do. They think about supplying their personal needs. A $70 boxed set that supplies everything needed to play for 5 players is an incredible value. It comes out to $14 per player. But many RPG gamers will balk at that price.<br/><br/>3. My suspicion is that RPG gamers are more likely to buy individual components a la carte at a premium than pay less for a bundle that includes everything.<br/><br/>4. The cost/mental stress of the production/assembly/packaging of a boxed set and its components is always greater than you think it will be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341212/#Comment_341212" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T10:13:42+00:00" title="September  1, 2011 10:13AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thor,<br/><br/>Dude, that's some good stuff.

The Mountain Witch struck me particularly that way. <br/><br/>It is technically doable. I've been doing board game versions of my Engle Matrix Games for years. Now I'm doing them in small (3.75x5x2) boxes with color tiles, nice counters and rules. I did the larger boxes (11x8.5x2) with a fold out hard game board. It can be made to look good without tons of machines. 11x17 stickers, a 17" wide ink jet, a couple of kinds of varnish, and time. You can buy the boxes from Uline.<br/><br/>As to what needs to be in the box. I've recognized that I like to play pretty games more than ugly games. I know it doesn't make sense but they prettyness of the Fiasco book cover makes the game more appealing. In a boxed game I want a nice board, I want cool counters or niggly bits, I want the rules to be real clean and I don't want to have to invent half of the game to be able to play it. If it's in a box I want it to deliver a board game experience. To me that means I'm able to play it within 20 minutes of opening the box - not 2 hours! I try to make my games playable in 5 minutes after opening. This is doable.<br/><br/>Doing it DIY you can be in profit from the first game made. The only question is does the game maker want to do this with a particular product. It had better be good to warrent the extra effort it takes to do up a box and bits.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341225/#Comment_341225" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T10:49:40+00:00" title="September  1, 2011 10:49AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I forgot price.<br/><br/>$25 for a small box<br/>$40 for a larger box<br/><br/>For $60 I'm going to want some nice plastic figures rather than card board counters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341226/#Comment_341226" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T10:54:25+00:00" title="September  1, 2011 10:54AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>Case in point: How people completely freaked out over Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd Edition's $100 price tag.

It seems that there are actually only two price-levels in my personal purchase strategy: if it's a small game (short text without overbearing cultural merits, basically) then I'll grow suspicious of the pricing if it hits around 30 \u20ac, and if it's a large game I'll go up to 50 \u20ac without blinking an eye. Anything above that has to have actual material components that justify the price, but it seems to me that up to that anything the publisher chooses to invest in production values is dust in the wind for me in comparison to actual design quality: I'll buy your small game for 25 \u20ac if I'm convinced of its pedigree, and I'll buy your big game for 45 \u20ac if I'm convinced of its pedigree, and that's that - doesn't matter if it comes in a box or not. If you're asking 80 \u20ac, though, I'll start looking at why you're asking so much, which might be a problem if I decide that actually, I don't feel like subsidizing your desire to have plastic miniatures in what amounts to a hex-chit strategy game or a hand-made wooden box for what amounts to three rpg booklets and some dice.

The game closet is full, even though I added lots of extra shelving. Dozens and dozens of old books, only about 2/3 of which I ever read. And we have board games stored under the couch in the living room.<br/><br/>A few years ago I did an indie game splurge and bought Dogs and TSOY and PTA. Those were the last physical RPG books I bought. And I don't have plans to buy more anytime soon.<br/><br/>I also have dozens and dozens of PDFs of game books. To be honest, many of them are ones I acquired online without appropriate monetary compensation. (Yeah, I know, I'm a big jerkface and I'm making you poor. I do sort of feel bad about that. But not bad enough to cough out cash for materials I'm only using for tangential reference.) Mostly I either read those on screen or print them out at work to read (usually in 4 page / sheet booklet form).<br/><br/>So if I were going to buy a boxed set game, it would be because I knew for absolutely 100% positive that I was going to be able to play it. And I'd be surprised if that was going to happen anytime soon. Maybe, just maybe, when my son is a few years older (he's 9 right now and participating in his first tabletop campaign - he first larped at 7, I think it was) he'll be into it enough to try out some random short game sessions. At which time, a good one-shot complete boxed set game might be useful. We're going to a gaming convention this weekend, so that'll be his first exposure to playing one-off games in multiple systems. Hopefully he'll enjoy that.<br/><br/>So, to sum up. How much would I pay right now for a boxed set RPG game? Right now - nothing. If it sounded neat, I might be interested in the pdf to read through once. Though, to be honest, I would attempt to acquire it in dodgy ways. I know that's not what you want to hear, but I'm giving you an honest answer, which I figure is more useful than a comfortable fib.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341243/#Comment_341243" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T12:10:38+00:00" title="September  1, 2011 12:10PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would it be at all viable to sell the game as a regular book and then sell the other components as an add-on pack?

Most of the official downloads aren't even that expensive, either. I've spent a little over $50 this last couple of weeks buying various game PDFs, including Carry, Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks, Cosmic Patrol, and Solar System, among others (seriously, I think altogether I've purchased about fifteen PDFs for that $50), and while yeah, I may not end up playing ANY of them, they were still worth my investment. It's not like five bucks is gonna kill somebody's budget (unless, of course, their budget is such that they survive off instant noodles 24-7).<br/><br/>Still, with boxed sets, you're looking at spending $50 to get a single game. If there aren't any significant bells and whistles that go along with that, why even bother with making the set, even from the perspective of the publisher? Especially since boxed sets usually require ordering specific quantities in order to hit affordable price-points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341275/#Comment_341275" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T15:14:39+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  3:14PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only time I would really be excited about a boxed set, per se, is if the box itself was significant. Like the way the Vornheim book is apparently printed with playing aids on the back cover. And the way some of the dungeon tile sets come in boxes where the box itself is gridded and represents a raised area in the dungeon (and purposely has extra space to store more than just the tiles that come with it). Make the box itself a THING, and I'd be more excited about the boxed set.<br/><br/>But if it's just a container for holding a bundle of books and maybe some folded maps and such, then I'd rather have it be shrinkwrapped so I have a better sense of what I'm getting, even if I'm only seeing the spines and 1 back cover. <br/><br/>Or, like others said, bundle the doodads as an optional separate pack. Cheapass games used to do that - sell the core bits for each game, then sell a single set of tokens and such that allowed you to play them all (Not that I bought it. My mom went through our old game closet once and was ready to throw out bunches of board games. I rescued the useful bits for my "cheapass games box". Got all I needed. And I have these neat weird pawns made of wood with metal spheres at the top from some obscure game I never played - but the pawns were gorgeous.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty" title="MummyKitty"><img alt="MummyKitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/582/nF6IT7RM67QPV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty">MummyKitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341283/#Comment_341283" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T16:24:11+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  4:24PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a box set is cool as a GM, but the player's book and other stuff only players need should be available separately.
