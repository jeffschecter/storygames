I get the sense that the GM has to be quite vigilant for appropriate moments to push and weave threads. It's a very abstract game!<br/><br/>So, does anybody have some advice or techniques for me?

If PCs are going their own way and having fun, generating narrative then no need for shadow.  If they want more direction, then shadow is there to help the GM.  <br/><br/>Shadow can be as concrete or abstract as you need.  Can be obvious monsters or something like the titles disappearing from a movie.<br/><br/>A big challenge in running Solipsist is keeping track of the current state of reality.  PCs autosucceed when their actions conform to reality.<br/><br/>PCs have a ton of narrative control in Solipsist. But they are also focused around their view of reality.  If someone wants to be a superspy with gadgets that will be a big part of the story.

I think that might be it. (I'm rusty with this but you have wonderfully made me dig out my green book.)<br/><br/>The website has some cool stuff by David on Shadow Mastery too (as well as some additional text and Errata about Shadows): <a href="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/cms.extras" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/cms.extras</a><br/><br/>When I've run the game I've used the Shadow tokens to limit/discipline my mechanical influence as GM and to pace when things are reaching a climax (when the tokens are lowered in number I know to ratchet up the stakes). Content-wise I've just prepped maybe one or two strong themes or a sensory (visual, sound, scent) detail beforehand and riffed off that and the unfolding reality in play.<br/><br/>Trying to make Solipsist play meet a pre-agreed path is the way of madness and the mechanics (never mind the players!) will work against you no matter how hard you try.

If the Shadow tried to do an Unchange against the jet, resisting that would be difficulty 5 plus the number of shadow tokens not yet assigned to Threads.

It was fantastic. One of the players said it was the best gaming experience she's ever had.<br/><br/>There is no way that much of a summary of this game can be produced at this point. The narrative goes all over the place so fast. But I will give the most general details.<br/><br/>It is interesting how pretty much nobody, not even the GM, knows what the shadow incursion is until part way through the game. One of the Solipsists was a nut-job physicist obsessed with dimensional travel. He had a daughter who he often neglected. Turns out, she was also a Solipsist. The shadow influence creeps in where nobody is looking right? And removes something? Following the death of her mother, the shadow crept into her (neglected) emotional state and removed her sadness. The girl, evidently, then removed sadness from reality - especially sadness relating to death. Reality wasn't restored until the protagonist-Solipsists made this little girl cry.<br/><br/>Again, none of this was apparent until midway through our final session. But it was all there waiting to be discovered. The very first scene of the game had this girl playing with a dead dog in the parking lot of an abandoned gas station. This ribbon of continuity in a game that does it's damnedest to re-wire continuity pleases me to no end.<br/><br/>It was a very meaningful game. Really something special.<br/><br/>So, I'm going to write more about this, but it will have to wait until after Technicolor Dreams (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/296818903757296/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/events/296818903757296/</a>), which all of you in the Pacific Northwest should go to. But what I will have for you is:<br/>-A breakdown of all the things the GM &amp; Players do, in a quasi AW principles/soft moves/hard moves kind of thing. I just need to spruce up these documents before putting them out there. This makes the game playable. <br/>-Some commentary on Obsession/Limitations/Visions and what worked easily in play and what didn't.<br/>-Some commentary on what my GM prep was like and how that became useful.<br/><br/>But for the meanwhile, I have just a couple of points that made our last session come to a boil.<br/>-Hard scene framing, Fiasco style. Be relentless at moving to the next Most Important Moment.<br/>-Embrace the epic scale of ultimate power. The game needs you to do this. Go big, always.<br/>-This game, as it is right now, is most definitely an advanced story game. This will be tough with even one person not quite on the same wavelength. Get a tight group of *patient* people who are very comfortable with story games, and with their story telling instincts.<br/><br/>I hope this game gets played more often.<br/><br/>Tayler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hannah" title="Hannah"><img alt="Hannah" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hannah">Hannah</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400871/#Comment_400871" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T14:14:43+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  2:14PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2012 2:15PM by Hannah.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tayler!

Forgive me if you posted it somewhere else and I'm missing it. <br/><br/>Everyone, Tayler is amazing for deciphering this game and then laying it out so that other people can play it as well. It's an awesome game, and not actually that complicated mechanically (although, yeah, the roleplaying part takes confidence, a clear vision of what you and your character want, and some finesse). It's just that we found the book as laid out to be difficult to interpret and reference.<br/><br/>I don't think our game is that hard to summarize: A psychotic physicist, an ecoterrorist, and a social worker with hero complex fought ancient gods, stood  alone against a world stripped of compassion, and destroyed civilization as we know it, all to restore a little girl's grief. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404150/#Comment_404150" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T15:11:54+00:00" title="January 20, 2013  3:11PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to say (and I'm sorry it took me so long, I've not been around, but luckily Gregor Hutton caught me in the street), that I've seen Taylor's rule's summary sheet and it's a work of beauty.
