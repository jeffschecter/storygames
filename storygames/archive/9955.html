I posted several days ago on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/" rel="nofollow">Snail's Pace</a>, but it seems to be rather slow over there, and I haven't got any hits. So I figured it'd be worthwhile to give it a shot to solicit for players over here to play over there.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcerpted from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/comments.php?DiscussionID=115&amp;page=1#Item_2" rel="nofollow">[Rats in the Walls]: Playtest-by-Post</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe game: Rats in the Walls has nothing to do with Lovecraft. Sorry. What it is is a spiteful little game about hate-driven timeshifters, who have the means to change their pasts (and thus, each others' pasts) granted by reality-warping hatred and wrath. If this sounds like the movie "The Butterfly Effect", then you're looking in the right direction. Game play in limited playtests has been very dynamic, with players purposely and inadvertently fucking with each other's happy endings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game isn't ever going to be a happy game. The chances of your character coming out of it alive and sane are pretty slim. The chances of you ending your play on any sort of win condition is almost impossible. If you want to explore the idea of what you'll do to harm what you hate, and whether or not hatred is stronger than love, then you're probably the sort of playtester I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have run this game successfully a few times. I haven't ever finished out a scenario, but I can say that the game does work, at least so long as I'm present to make sure the rules aren't full of holes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy I'm here: It was pointed out by a friend in the initial playtests that the turn structure of the game would lend itself to asynchronous play, and it would allow for better thought-out and more nuanced time changes and consequences. So, here I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisclaimer: I have no experience with asynchronous gaming. I tried to play a game of RitW once before play by post, but before we could even really get more than a few posts into it, one of the players vanished, and there were various technical issues. If people are interested (I'd like 2-4 players, if possible) then we'll have to have a bit of a palaver about exactly how this is supposed to go down, before we get started.<br/>\n<br/>\nRules text available here: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/RitW.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/RitW.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221050/#Comment_221050" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T21:34:07+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  9:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested.
