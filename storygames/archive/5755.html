In my mind, if criticism happens after the game has already had several hundred copies printed, that's far too late.  Revisions and addendum and the like are all great, but not as good as having the criticism happen before games get commercially released.  However, when people are not writing or designing their games in public, or when open playtests have only moderate participation, it's really hard for that to happen, yeah?  I can think of a couple of really cool games in playtest right now, Anna's <i>Thou Art But A Warrior</i> and Brennan's <i>How We Came To Live Here</i>, and it seems like they've only got a few folks actively involved in playing and offering criticism before the games get declared "done" and go to layout and commercial release.<br/><br/>Honestly, that's where the tragedy is for me, not that criticism doesn't happen after games released (because then it's almost too late), but that people aren't taking it upon themselves to offer criticism before mistakes or oversights become harder to fix.  For my money, I'd rather be involved in and see more criticism at that stage in the game.</blockquote>\nSo what about actively organizing folks to do critical reads / playtests of games that are mostly finished but not yet published (or published games about to go in for a reprint, to help fix any remaining issues)?

Whats more, not everyone will produce their best results in public. Not everyone will get good feedback from "everyone." Which is one of the reasons, I think, we're seeing the fracture. As we get more games that are designed for Not You we will get more games about which your opinion or playtesting isn't going to be helpful. As we get more games designed for Not You we'll get more games that we just can't agree about.<br/><br/>Like, IAWA has such a place in this thread because, I think, its a big dividing line. I loved it. I've actually played it. I've had actual rocking play with it. I also have something not always great to say about the layout of the CR section, but that's an issue few others have talked about or seem to care about. Others have played it and liked it, but only after a hard time. Others have played and it and not liked it -- sometimes for exactly the reasons I did play it.<br/><br/>Should IAWA have been written better? Designed better?<br/><br/>I dunno, better for who? Better in what way? Better for which committee of the community defining what quality is for which population?<br/><br/>And no, I don't mean that as snotty. Because the design in public has had a very important function in the history of Indie RPG development -- it has led to a certain amount of community standard. It has lead to a kind of social vetting process by which members of the community let each other know before publication what they will and will not take. It has thus lead to a good standard.<br/><br/>But that's breaking down, broken down. And now we've got games being designed in smaller pools, and possibly for smaller pools, but a lot of folks still want the rule and the standard of the old group.<br/><br/>But just because we had it then and don't have it now doesn't mean its gone forever, or that returning to "everyone design in front of everyone else" is the only, or best, way to fix it. Still designing for review, still designing with others commenting and playtesting and pushing, is still good and still possible. It just happens in different groups, with different standards. And, for some people, missing the old group and not having found a new one, it doesn't happen at all.<br/><br/>Which sucks. Like, especially when it happens across old tight lines. But I think the answer is not to try to rebuild the one community with the one core value, but to ride the wave and distribute it across lots of different communities. Accept that NerdSoCal and Nerd NYC and Toronto Indie are going to have different standards, and build up those community standards where you are (even if that is virtual), rather than looking to be excited and involved in every game from every group that has "indie" attached to its name.</blockquote>\nCrossposting because it's important to discuss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128695/#Comment_128695" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:50:13+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:50PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, the Ashcan Front is great, but it's a booth at one (or maybe two) of the major game conventions.  I'm talking about something that can happen whenever and also, as Paul says, can address the way the games operate as texts, not just whether the game mechanics function.<br/><br/>Brand's right, though.  It's important to have criticism from your target audience(s), whoever they may be.  I still think we can do a better job of organizing that to make it happen, but he's right that we can't have the same 10 people read and run a given game and think that's going to work for every game out there.  But I think if we could recruit groups of critics for specific games and tailor them to the specific needs or interests of a given game or designer, we could make the playtesting / proofing process better or at least easier for many people.  Not everyone has, like, Thor on speed dial and it's possible that not every game is going to appeal to Thor and his hardcore playtest crew.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Really, LAGames has been running for... shit, two years, now.  If you're not familiar with us, the short version: there's a group of three to six guys in LA, see, and we get together weekly and we playtest stuff.  Every week, and usually churn through two or three games a month.  We playtest our own projects and we playtest others' projects.  It's really fantastic.<br/><br/>But how hard would it be to network that?  LAGames and some hypothetical SFGames could get together and set up the most basic of structures: "We'll playtest one of your designs once a month and you playtest one of our designs once a month."  Obviously, time slots become an issue, but not an unsurmountable one.<br/><br/>Anybody want to see if they can strike up a regular playtest group in their area?  It's easier than it sounds, and it's hella rewarding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128711/#Comment_128711" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T13:03:38+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  1:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 1:03PM by J_Walton.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've already got one in SGBoston.

I repeat: It is what you are after here in this thread. That you don't think so dismays me greatly. It's a symptom that our project is failing.<br/><br/>To whit: <br/><br/>The Ashcan Front is NOT a project to examine mechanics exclusively. Of course it can also examine texts.<br/><br/>The Ashcan Front is NOT a thing that exists a GenCon and then only again at the next GenCon. It is a year-round project of examining games-in-production, or pre-publication.<br/><br/>The Ashcan Front is a lead-by-example kind of thing that says "Hey, gang, we think we don't do a good job of critiquing games and making them the best they can be. So, we're putting our money (no shit) where our mouth is and showing people a viable means to do jus that." It is much more a <i>movement</i> than it is a <i>production</i> or enterprise or whatever.<br/><br/>It is precisely watching the kind of nonsense and drama we saw today here on SG and saying "Ok, enough. We've got to DO something. All this noise and arguing is basically useless!"<br/><br/>Imagine me cringing almost exactly one year later to watch the whole thing repeat with barely any mention, at all, of the Ashcan Front. That is The Suck.<br/><br/>In short, I see absolutley no distinction between this thing you're calling "prevenge" and this thing Paul and I call "Ashcan Front." The problem is obviously one of our poor communication and promotion. But, some of the problem is also with people unwilling or unaware they can get involved, for example, on the forums.

It worked for me -- I put the lid of a probably-not-half-baked game and get to use those experiences in the future.  It worked for Paul -- he's almost got a done design, thanks to the 'Front.

I can never remember which is which with the "push vs. pull" thing, but the Ashcan Front is one of those -- the problem lies on the other side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128727/#Comment_128727" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T13:18:48+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  1:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, how much of that is what the Ashcan Front is and how much of that is what you want it to be?

It is, I swear it is, it's my freaking job.  It takes practice, and it takes work, and it takes discipline, but it can be done.  That's why I think the<em>Owlbear</em>idea has legs, because it offers a peer-reviewed place to do that with some safeguards in place to prevent if from descending into madness.  I'm not saying that we should just criticize with abandon; I sure as hell am not trying to draw a dividing line between who's in and who's out of the kiddie pool.  I'm saying we should criticize carefully and intentionally and honestly, and with the best interests of our fellow designers at heart.  And I think it's possible.</blockquote>\nWe see eye to eye here, actually.  It<i>is</i>possible.<br/><br/>I just don't think it's possible<i>in public</i>.  I'm fine with taking some stuff to the public stage<i>after</i>it's been vetted in a few one on one conversations (my preferred mode of receiving criticism) or within a trusted circle.  This is actually one of the things I really liked about the peer feedback groups in Game Chef: it kept the number of critic-cooks in the kitchen to a managable size.<br/><br/>It's full on open public critiquing that I think is damn near impossible to pull off well on the internet.  Because it takes too much work in such a venue to achieve the benefits that are far easier to attain in the aforementioned smaller ones.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I'm not arguing (or at least, not<i>intending to argue</i>-- I'll own that I might have done so without thinking about it) against the need for critique.  I'm arguing about the<i>venue</i>where it works best.<br/><br/>Something like the Master Mines -- or, I guess, the "Owlbear idea", though I'm not sure what that is -- is doing it right, I think: creating a smaller, focused discussion group around a small number of games, as a method for improving those games for their release.

Outreach can only solve that issue to a certain degree. This isn't a judgment against the Front - it does what it does, and more power to it.

We'd welcome it.</blockquote>\nOn the one hand, I was and am really excited about the Ashcan Front.  As a testing-only participant, it's let me down in that what feedback I've given seems to have boiled off into vacuum (to whit: there's a superbly dominant strategy for chargen in A:.o:.E:. that I mentioned on the Front's forums and that Paul didn't acknowledge.)  So, while, <em>yes</em> make the Front do more, make it reach out to more designers and all of that, also realize that there's different expectations.<br/><br/>Also, the Front is publicized as covering a very special part of the lifecycle of a design: 90% done.  Where the remaining 10% will take the other 90% of the time.  I think there's a lot of utility to the sort of cross-pollenization that JR is talking about.  Presenting a 30% done idea to your friends, and testing it in person to see what of it is worth keeping is one thing.  Sending a 70% done design to other designers to test blind is another.  Ashcans are something very else.  They're all valuable processes.<br/><br/>The other part that I'm objecting to as I see it (and maybe it's not even showing up quite in this discussion) is the idea that criticism after publication is too late.  That's bollocks.  It might (emphasis on "might") be too late for this book.  But if it encourages someone else to do a further cycle of testing, or to have another pair of eyes or a new table take a look at their game, it wins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128786/#Comment_128786" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T15:15:14+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  3:15PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jonathan,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>"Hi Brennan!

I don't think either of these things is generally true (though I'm sure the latter happens sometimes, via serendipity). The Ashcan Front is actually founded on belief in the reverse. That the landscape of games-in-development is crowded, increasingly so, and so you're going to have to dial up your efforts and fight for reading, playtesting and critiquing of your game if you're going to get it. You need to package your game-in-development in a way that helps people realize they want you to succeed and that they're willing to put time into making sure you do. You need to present your game-in-development in a way that helps them help you. And you, not me, are best able to do that.<br/><br/>I spent a couple of months contacting folks early last year. And it was with that message. (Ask Judd. Ask Clyde.) I wish it were the other way around, and we did have a community champing for doing the hard work. But I think the reason we have this conversation every year about too many half-baked games is because efforts built on what we ought to be doing as a community (providing honest critique, doing more pre-publication reading and feedback) haven't been successful. Well, The Ashcan Front isn't going to eliminate that in six months. But I'll say this, I will be quite surprised if <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> of the ashcan games from the booth last year is pilloried as a half-baked game once it's done and published.<br/><br/>When Matt says The Ashcan Front isn't a Gen Con project, what he's saying is that it's a year-round cultural project: You don't have to wait until Gen Con to do your game as an ashcan. You don't have to wait until Gen Con to use market forces and presentation to fight for reading, playtesting, and critiquing of your game-in-development.

I don't think either of these things is generally true.</blockquote>\nActually, this may be where we disagree.  Designers are loathe to push their unfinished games on other people.  After all, they still suck.  They're not finished.  And maybe, who knows, they're actually terrible (what all people fear deep down inside about their creations).  And they don't want to take up other people's valuable time.  Especially if they're just going to have to do it again later when the next revision of the rules comes out.  So what do they do?  They post open calls for playtesters.  They contact a few people who may be interested.  And that's about it.  They don't follow up that often because they don't want to grub for people's attention or bug people who might be busy or not really interested.  But I think an outside party is much more free to be pushy and enthusiastic about a game-in-progress without seeming like an arrogant asshole.  I can be like "ZOMG Brennan's game rocks on toast!  You and you, come play it with me RIGHT NOW!  Harper, have you read this shit yet?  It is awesome!"<br/><br/>Also, I think you underestimate folks' commitment to helping indie games not suck, especially if they are indie games that they are excited about playing and thus have a personal investment in.  Like, for example, Paul's <i>Penny for My Thoughts</i> sounds like it's going to be a really hot game and I think Paul is one of the best things to ever happen to indie roleplaying, but <i>Penny</i> just doesn't seem all that grabby to me right now, so I haven't gotten involved in the playtesting or given him any feedback.  But if we found a place to post info on all the indie games currently in playtest and people could gravitate towards the ones that seized them by the lapels, that would be awesome.  That would sort of mitigate the thing Brand said about different games needing different playtest audiences that will give them the tough love they need.  If I'm enthusiastic about a game and want to play it RIGHT NOW, then playtesting it or giving feedback doesn't feel like work.  It feels like awesome. Plus, there seem to be fair number of people interested in providing harsh criticism in general, so they could probably be invited to do so in a very productive stage in the game.<br/><br/>You see where I'm coming from?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128832/#Comment_128832" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T17:40:24+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  5:40PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>I do see where you're coming from. Yes, the Ashcan Front is about the designer being a bit pushy in representing his game-in-development, and the ashcan purchaser then being positioned by the market relationship to not let the designer not receive his feedback (witness Judson giving me a hard time above). But part of the formula for ashcanfront.net was to be a blog front-end where Matt and I could blurb about ashcans being made available by designers (not just booth-participating ashcans, but any and all ashcans) and errata releases and significant online discussions and actual play reports wherever on the internet they might be found.<br/><br/>So, the site was intended to be a clearinghouse for enthusiasm about ashcans. That's why I originally chose Drupal for the site, because it could be a blog on the front of forums. Except the Drupal forum software was disappointing. And I think the Vanilla forums are wrong for the kinds of discussions that ashcans needs. So I haven't found the right software formula, and the site hasn't lived up to my initial vision for it.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128839/#Comment_128839" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T17:49:11+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  5:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to cross the streams, but the "central repository" idea from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5752&amp;page=1#Item_25" rel="nofollow">Fixing the Game Recognition Reward Cycle</a> could totally also provide a list of what projects it had files on, what stage of development they were in, and what kind of feedback the designer-author was looking for.<br/><br/>I'm asking for sourceforge.net, aren't I?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128841/#Comment_128841" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T17:51:01+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  5:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I had no idea about that extended version of the Ashcan Front idea.

Today's my friggin' birthday, so I have no free time through next Monday (as I'll be going to Go Play Peoria!). And I haven't even read Paul's replies here yet. <br/>So, let me clarify some important things: <br/><br/>I'm not "offended" or anything of the sort if people do something outside the Ashcan Front. How could I be? I can't. I'd welcome it. And, in fact, I see skimming above that people are rightly pointing to good stuff already going on, like Iain's forum.<br/><br/>Secondly, it's easy for me to open my big yap without keeping abreast of Pauls always-thoughtful vision for AF. We're on the same page, and we don't do things UNLESS we're on the same page. So, a major reason I'm not replying with more details to questions here is that Paul and I want to speak the same language, and have the same goals.<br/><br/>Finally, I don't regard any of this as Paul's and my "turf." That'd be just crazy for us to get protective. Indeed, it would run EXACTLY counter to our primary  goal, which is to ignite publishing avenues for people across the hobby and let each person do their thing with a more supportive, collective "acceptance" of what kinds of things one can do as a publisher. <br/><br/>More to come once I get some time! Also, Jonathan and others, I think you're exploring some excellent territory here; I'm passionate about it, obviously. I think this is very important stuff to discuss about the Aschan Front. I also think I've pretty mightily derailed the thread, too. Paul or I will likely start a new one to carry it on. (I'm happy to reply to questions here, but that's no reason to dilute other discussion, either.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128930/#Comment_128930" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T23:56:47+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to point out an obvious thing here.<br/><br/>I've championed for better editing and structuring of text for years, and I've come to believe that many - perhaps most - designers <i>don't actually want</i> external criticism. They want to playtest with their friends and spouses, have other friends and spouses* read their games, and then put them out there. This is what people do. It's <i>not</i> for lack of people willing to read and criticize their work prior to publication. There are other reasons; I don't know what they are.<br/><br/>During the last three years, I've offered plenty of people help - both in public and in private. Some were designers who'd published games that badly needed editing, and who were about to start work on second editions. The only person to ever take me up on my offer was <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=15361.msg164103#msg164103" rel="nofollow">Adam Dray, back in 2005</a>. <br/><br/>Being a writer is to accept that your text - <i>all</i> raw text - needs rewriting. Being a <i>serious</i> writer is to accept that you can't do that alone. And, in this case, "alone" includes "with your best friend and their best friend". As long as people don't <i>want</i> to be serious about what they do, there's not much to be done.<br/><br/>* A lot of spouses there, yes.

They want to playtest with their friends and spouses, have other friends and spouses* read their games, and then put them out there. This is what people do. It's<i>not</i>for lack of people willing to read and criticize their work prior to publication.

I set up a website with chunks of text and asked people for comments, I posted files here and on collective endeavour, I emailed people, I had Gregor Hutton pass out an Ashcan at Gencon, I started threads (and APs) here, and at the Forge, and you know what .... I found it VERY hard to get any response.<br/><br/>By dint of nagging, to the point where I felt bad about posting at all, because no one was interested, I got some response (more on CE than here, slightly more on here than the Forge), which was greatly appreciated, but help was most certainly not being offered left right and center. Half the people who got the Ashcan and said they would comment, didn't. Half the threads I started here got no responses. No one ever commented on the website I set up, and so on. In fact Ian's playtesting site was the only place that actually produced people to playtest (except for spookyfanboy here, who played it spontaneously <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So maybe there isn't a lot of help, or maybe it helps to have your name known before you ask, or maybe I was doing something wrong, but I did not find it easy to get any help / criticism / whatever, even when I asked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128937/#Comment_128937" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T01:01:15+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I completely see your point. You weren't doing anything wrong, and I've been in your position lots of times. <br/><br/>For me, I think it goes like this:<br/><br/>- If someone I've never heard of asks the general public for help (via a forum thread, or on their website, or on a mailing list), I hardly ever reply. This is from a long history of helping people who want to get their first big project off the ground, only to realize that they're not actually going to invest the effort, and the project never materializes. <br/>- If someone who's previously finished a project asks the general public, I'm more interested. I know they're serious about this, and willing and able to make the effort to get the project off the ground. If the project looks like fun, I'll get in touch for playtest. <br/>- If someone who's previously finished a project contacts me directly, via mail or otherwise, I'll help them. <br/>- If someone I've never heard of contacts me directly, I might help them if the project looks like fun. It has to be fun enough that it makes it worth spending my time on even if it's never published, since my experience tells me that statistically, this person most probably won't finish their project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128946/#Comment_128946" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T01:41:40+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:41AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your approach certainly makes sense, and I guess I would probably do the same, though with the further hesitation that because I know i don't have a big history or background or wealth of experience I might not comment because I don't feel qualified.<br/><br/>But I suspect the people who you are least likely to help are the ones who need your help most <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Now that's not an attempt to say "go out there and help them" that's a personal decision, its more a wish that there were more people who did want to take the risk on people they didn't know.

But they saw my game on a list, took it, played it, and sent me a report. That was fantastic, and we need more of that.

After each time, we spoke on the phone, where he offered a TON of valuable feedback.  The first conversation was over two hours long and was chock full of amazing goodness.  That was a fun conversation, actually.  I was almost done writing the final manuscript, and Jason was working from the playtest notes.  So, frequently Jason would say, "This thing here is really important, and you should emphasize it in the final draft."  Then I'd look and say, "Yep!  Already doing that!"  This might not seem like a big deal, but it was actually <i>quite</i> affirming to me that I was actually meeting the players' needs with my manuscript.  I added the Authority and Investigator handouts to the book based on his feedback.  And he taught me stuff about my own game, like using Mistaken Identities to "resurrect" murder victims or using a local phone book as both a names list and a semi-random location generator.  (I mean, all the names and places will be authentic, right?)<br/><br/>Beyond that, he's brought a lot of his experience with the genre to bear on the project, offering valuable insight and feedback on the game, and he has promoted it along the way by running it at these local cons.<br/><br/>So, datapoint and all that, plus a shout out to Jason for all his help.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
