The way conflicts are handled fits the genre, and having really poor abilities be a benefit in some situations (being too dumb to realize you should be affected by gravity) also led to many a laugh back when I played Toon (twenty years ago). But once you get past the initial mechanics, it becomes far too crunchy for its own good - too much description for how things work, later supplements with ranges, durations, etc., just didn't lend itself to "comedy."<br/><br/><i>Paranoia</i> is another good example, but in the opposite direction. Mechanically, its a standard RPG with high mortality rates and dangerous weapons that are probably too crunchy for their own good. The comedy, however, comes through the setting. Insane computers, suicidal missions, catch 22s, conspiracies, etc. But if the person running the game, and the players too, don't have a good grasp on the setting, and haven't watched plenty of Marx Bros. films and Three Stooges, mixed with Orwellian predictions and Terry Nation political oppressiveness, then it isn't quite the same.<br/><br/><i>Ghostbusters</i>, or, at least, the original version of it (not the later Ghostbusters International), was a good balance between setting and crunch. It had something specific you could refer to for how the comedy should work (the movie, and later the cartoon), and the mechanics were simple enough to support comedy in that setting. The way they describe how failures happen and damage is suffered, made it feel less like "I could die at any moment," and more like "man, falling off this building is gonna <i>hurt</i>!!"<br/><br/>Another comedy game I've liked for both setting and simplicity was <i>Teenagers From Outer Space</i>. Mechanically very simple, and part of the comedy comes from having traits that are too high or too low (got a Cool of 6? Man, those girls will NEVER leave you alone...EVER). Skills are encouraged to be somewhat eccentric-sounding. And powers are described very simply, letting you know what they do, but not necessarily describing every bit of range/duration/etc. Just enough description so you can use it and abuse it to your heart's content. And the setting, though it also requires familiarity with the genre, is ripe for comedy. Aliens. High school. Girls. Awkward romances. High explosives. Boy/Girl/Boy rayguns. Although, I guess with the variety of anime available nowadays, settings such as this might have gotten buried under the hentai or giant robots or cyber-alchemists of current years.<br/><br/>In most cases, though, it really just hinges on both the players and GM agreeing on "what feels like comedy," and just improvising from there. Most humorous fun I've had recently with RPGs has been with Ben Lehman's <i>High Quality Role Playing</i>, which has been a laugh-riot, despite the high mortality rates and gruesome deaths that my characters keep meeting. But its all because as a group, we all kind of have this unspoken agreement on what's funny.<br/>A male witch who plies his sex-magic trade under the guise of selling carpets? Funny.<br/>A barber-surgeon who is cowardly and believes he's a werewolf? Funny.<br/>A hulking ogre soldier who lets his wolves tear our party to shreds and tries to slaughter us horribly? Funny (in the correct context).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361638/#Comment_361638" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T09:27:35+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  9:27AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite><a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/the-daughters-of-verona/" rel="nofollow">The Daughters of Verona</a><br/><br/>Well, the game was written to emulate the classical interpretation of comedy, i.e. the story ends with a marriage.

In my group, the opposite also takes place: when it's imperative to get serious (for dramatic purposes) people just can't stop making jokes. It's not always the setting (though it can help a lot) that makes a game tragic/funny or not, it's the consensus about the group mood. However, GMs and influential players can sway it to one way or another, with the help of a proper ruleset and setting.<br/><br/>You want to make it fun? try to get some "contrasting concepts" on it. Like, playing Toon on the darkest D&amp;D setting of your choice and letting players try to take it seriously... wait, somebody aready <a href="http://finallegion.foroactivo.com/t269-el-rol-de-los-panchitos" rel="nofollow">did it.</a> And yes, the comic is actually a sort of sample of play.

Comedy can come from things the text puts into the game to some degree, like some of the Dragon World character types give you wacky elements to use. There are so many ways to arrive at comedy that it's hard to make generalizations about what kinds of rules work. Toon assumes that characters spring back from Falling Down after a little while, and Maid RPG has Stress that causes Stress Explosions as the only actual "damage" mechanic, but then Paranoia glorifies in the characters' messy and frequent deaths.<br/><br/>In terms of techniques to use at the game table, my major insight is that you shouldn't force the funny. Some of what makes comedy work is the non-funny parts, the setup that the silly stuff can be a contrast to, plus if you do it right, silly characters coming together to do something important and serious can be glorious. As goofy and tasteless as Red vs. Blue is, Reconstruction had this amazing, blazing revelation towards the end mixed in with all the comedy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361766/#Comment_361766" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T12:52:50+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 12:52PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've recently run two different humorous games, the above mentioned <i>Dragon World</i>, and <i>Monkey</i> (Journey to the West RPG).

It helped, of course, that I had good players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361767/#Comment_361767" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T12:53:18+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 12:53PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and lest I forget <i>Kobolds Ate My Baby!</i><br/><br/>Having certain actions be required of the players (re: everyone chanting "All Hail King Torg!" anytime the name "King Torg" is mentioned) can lead to quite a bit of fun, especially when they try to trip other people up.<br/><br/>Sometimes having the running gag does a lot to add humor, as long as you don't have more than a couple going at once.

Every time they snookered me into saying it, they'd do the sound effects, and I'd give them a +2 bonus to their next actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361797/#Comment_361797" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T13:38:07+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  1:38PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>Another comedy game I've liked for both setting and simplicity was<i>Teenagers From Outer Space</i>. Mechanically very simple, and part of the comedy comes from having traits that are too high or too low (got a Cool of 6? Man, those girls will NEVER leave you alone...EVER). Skills are encouraged to be somewhat eccentric-sounding. And powers are described very simply, letting you know what they do, but not necessarily describing every bit of range/duration/etc. Just enough description so you can use it and abuse it to your heart's content. And the setting, though it also requires familiarity with the genre, is ripe for comedy. Aliens. High school. Girls. Awkward romances. High explosives. Boy/Girl/Boy rayguns. Although, I guess with the variety of anime available nowadays, settings such as this might have gotten buried under the hentai or giant robots or cyber-alchemists of current years.<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, this. But with <b>Maids</b>.<br/><br/>In fact, I pretty much sell Maid as a spiritual successor to <b>Teenagers From Outer Space</b>.<br/><br/>This was actually my "spiel" when I hocked Maid back at GC a few years ago:<br/><br/>Dude: "Maid... the RPG??? Wut?"<br/>Me: "Yeah man, are you familiar with, say, Teenagers from Outer Space or TOON?"<br/>Dude: "No." (9/10ths of the time)<br/>Me: <b>PAUSES TEN SLOW SECONDS TO CRY ON THE INSIDE, RAISING AN ANGRY FIST TO GOD FOR SUCH A MISFORTUNE. HOW. COULD. THEY. NOT. KNOWWWWwwwwwww.</b><br/>Me: "Well, Maid is..." (blah blah blah)<br/><br/>So yeah, the Maid RPG - as a book - is funny. It's got weird, crazy, wacky stuff in it. Costumes. Crazy Items. Weird replays. Silly dialogue. But that has nothing to do with it being funny at the table, IMO. Tales of the Floating Vagabond is fucking hilarious in the book, but at the table it's always been "Meh". And Paranoia is the funniest RPG in the world, but in play is far more miss than hit with me unless it's with a group I trust, because you play it at a con and all of a sudden it's fucking "PORTAL: THE CAKE IS A LIE" jokes but about THE COMPUTER and 100 times worse, punctuated by hoary snorts and guffaws.<br/><br/>In play, a couple things add to the success of it coming off funny:<br/>* There's precedent. Comedy anime, which people have usually seen before sitting at the table. <br/>* The rules are extremely light. No bogging down and losing pace/rythm.<br/>* The rules, like TFOS or TOON (or Paranoia, actually) produce characters wildly - WILDLY - imbalanced in terms of abilities. This is like a "Fiasco playset, with their 'imbalanced situation ready to explode' ", but within each and every character at the table, tied directly to the rules.<br/>* Possibility for in-fighting (not necessarily death/KOs/physical, but the ability to nudge or pull others out of the way)<br/>* The emphasis on imbalanced situations as well: Random crazy events, scenarios with bizarre setups or conditions, and so on.<br/><br/>And from there, it pretty much runs and defines itself from the first action a single PC takes.<br/><br/>There might be a few other things, but the above is basically it, a formula for comedy gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361814/#Comment_361814" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T14:05:32+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  2:05PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 2:08PM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Anima RPG corebook introduced the summoner class but didn't included enough monsters to summon (they came in a later supplement, 5 years after we started playing) So I just made a simple table detailing generic stats for the mosters and told the players <i>to come up with whatever they want on the run</i><br/><br/>They started by introducing pokemons, dragons that were useless in the first levels... and suddenly they were summoning ewok siths and even a fire-elemental Eric Estrada.

It's most obviously suited to gonzo absurdity.  A lot depends on the players' ability to generate funny material before play and then use it spontaneously in play.  It's fairly natural to adopt an "I am going to make you laugh right now!" approach, which makes the game less fun.  Whether overcoming that is a matter of attitude, practice, or something else, I'm not sure.

Perhaps I have no sense of humour. If I do I have a sense of humour, here is my reasoning behind it:<br/><br/>There are very few universal comedians, ones that cross international boundaries, and most of them don't write comedy RPGs.<br/><br/>However, I do laugh a lot when I play roleplaying games. I laugh a lot when I play games that could be funny, but that don't hit the laughs on the nose. For example, I've been playing Apocalypse World recently, and I've enjoyed how my favourite characters are starting to pantomime themselves. I'm also playing Annalise and, while it's dark and nasty, comedy happens. It's us, the players, who laugh. We're having fun (the real life, oooooh, hahahahaha, you cock, kind of fun).<br/><br/>I'm getting off topic. So... I'll answer these questions based on what makes <i>me </i>laugh. I'll also rephrase the questions. Is that okay?<br/><br/>1. Do you know games designed <span style="color: #660033;">to allow funniness while keeping the seatbelt on</span>? - Fiasco, Posin'd (controversial), Lady Blackbird, Durance, Spirit of the Century<br/>3. How would you design a such game?<br/>I wrote Hell for Leather and I think I can use that to make my point. It's a game of dark comedy. People who like it like it because it makes them laugh. In that game, I tried to create a system of tension balanced by an exaggerated award/penalty response. In Hell for Leather, the tension is created using a tower of dice. An actual, physical, visible stack of dice. These dice are placed within a circular target at which you throw other dice. If the tower falls or you miss the circular target when trying to overcome a fictional challenge, horrible things happen (it's players vs. system, there is no GM, so individual failures bleed into the group).<br/><br/>When the game is going well, there is a giddiness in that simple tension. Nevertheless, if you read the Hell for Leather rules, the comedy is pretty low key. It doesn't look like it's a funny game. That's probably a failure of my marketing. But hey, it was my first game. Gimme a break.<br/><br/>People who enjoy Hell for Leather laugh a lot. The tension is relieved by acts of ludicrous, Hollywood violence, as they watch their asshole characters dig themselves deeper and deeper holes. But the thing is, one groups' Hell for Leather comedy is another group's Hell for Leather nightmare. I saw one game where it was all manga characters in robot suits, and super gonzo mayhem. I enjoyed watching their passion, but it didn't make me laugh. Another time, I watch a guy talk about his old priest eating the kidneys out of a dying prophet, and it had me giggling for ages. Wow. I said it. You had to be there, etc. It was done in a funny way, with exaggeration and shouting obscenities for no reason. It was really well done.<br/><br/>It's important to me that the author either writes comedy gold or gives me enough room to write my own. So if I were designing another comedy game, which I won't, I'd stick to my guns. Write it like it's not comedy, provide a decent hook for a crazy story, provide rules to increase tension, tools to control absurdity and then let the players make it funny.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362251/#Comment_362251" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T05:18:54+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  5:18AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me if a game is going to be funny in play it has to take itself really seriously as a document.<br/><br/>In high school I ran Paranoia absolutely straight, emphasizing the dystopic horror implied in the setting, ignoring all the stupid attempts at humor written into the text.

I played it at the last con here with a group of complete strangers and practically ended laughing on the floor, truly exhilarating game.</blockquote>\n"Aye, Dark Overlord" in English.  Has lots of cute pictures of goblins and magical stuff (big breasted elves) on the cards.  Dark Overlord is a skeleton, it seems, who reminds me of Grimm from Billy and Mandy.<br/><br/>It's an Italian game (the original name is "S\xec, Oscuro Signore" - that is the literal translation of "Aye, Dark Overlord"). In the original pre-publication version the Dark Overlord was not depicted or named, but when it was brought and published by a publishing house it was with a famed comic book character (published by the same publishing house) called "Rigor Mortis" as the Dark Overlord (in his comic book he is, in fact, a Dark Overlord)<br/><br/>I never played the published version but I played it some times during the playtest phase, and it worked because seeing another player at the table groveling trying to make excuses was funny. It's a kind of "funny" caused by the things you have to do during the game that is rather easy to evoke (a lot of not-rpgs games are based on that, for example all the ones where someone has to mimic something for other people to guess)<br/><br/>Another way to create a funny game is to put characters (and /or players) in funny situations.  Paranoia is based on this (and can be played with people screaming "hail the Computer" every time someone name the computer, to add the kind of fun I talked above to the mix.<br/><br/>Some games, like Elfs, A Taste for Murder and the Upgrade add to this situational creation of funny situations the satiric angle.<br/><br/>There are other ways, too many to talk about many of them, but they reliably work because they don't ask you to come up with "funny things" by yourself.  The laughs come from simply following the rules, and when you add your creativity to the mix you are helped by solid procedures, guidelines or examples (for example, to make AtfM works, all you need to do is to think about something bad or evil that you want other characters to do or that your character did with the deceased. It's easy.  With The Upgrade all you need to do is making fun of reality shows, even more easy).<br/><br/>What will not work, and never worked, is telling people "now you must come up with something funny, anything you want". Then you get the blank stares. The games where the people get "points" or "bennies" if they are "fun".   (Primetime adventures can be a borderline case: if you want to create a comical show using only the fanmail ecology is a very un-funny exercise in trying to be funny, but it's possible to make it work by creating characters and situations that give the players the help I talked above) <br/><br/>The point is that if a game tell you to do something with clear limitations and objectives, and it's that something that it's funny, it can work. But telling people simply to "be fun" doesn't work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362509/#Comment_362509" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T18:23:28+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  6:23PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stuperpowers.

I've found if you are too loose about the game and the rules or if you allow people to spend time "knowingly winking" and "acting funny", then it falls flat and runs out of steam either in the first hour or by the end of the first session.<br/><br/>Fiasco worked well for me the moment I realised that I wasn't supposed to actually like my character. He is a buffoon. Not a lovable guy, who got accidentally mixed up with some stuff. As soon as I gave my characters a strongly dislikable trait, the game opened up for me and I started enjoying the chaos and mayhem they get involved in.<br/><br/>I think the key to figuring out a comedy game is to have a reasonably strong grasp of the type of humour it's supposed to bring out at the table. The style of the book can sometimes help to get this across, but it can also be overdone. Paranoia is a prime example for flavour text that both transports the type of humour the game supports as well as overselling it. You can also rely on the group itself to find their type of humour within the boundaries of the game, the way Fiasco does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362571/#Comment_362571" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T06:08:47+00:00" title="February 25, 2012  6:08AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sbszine</cite>InSpectres is reliably funny, I think because the comedy is inherent in the system rather than just being a bunch of jokes in the text.</blockquote>\nYes, this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362573/#Comment_362573" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T06:18:11+00:00" title="February 25, 2012  6:18AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Georgios</cite>Fiasco worked well for me the moment I realised that I wasn't supposed to actually like my character.

Contrast is also funny.<br/><br/>I agree in theory, but haven't seen this actually work in practice. Whenever I've introduced Fiasco to people, whoever ended up with the "straight man" didn't enjoy the game at all.<br/><br/>I think once you figure the game out for yourself, it works well. And if the rest of the group is on the same page, you can get a lot of mileage from introducing a "straight man" into the story. In other words, unlike most other rpgs, playing the "good guy" is an advanced technique in Fiasco.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
