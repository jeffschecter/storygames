Instead of cops-and-robbers, we've moved the focus to the neighborhood, and that's been really interesting.  The seasonal arc is all about gentrification in a down-at-the-heels, racially mixed Cincinnati neighborhood.  <br/><br/>I'm playing an African-American father who spent 15 years in prison for an unspecified but heinous crime.  Now he's a slumlord, having inherited half a dozen walk-ups from his deceased father.  His story arc is all about being a good man and a good father, and everything - everything - is trying to keep him from that path.  It's a pretty cool set-up.  Think Cutty from The Wire, but with two teenaged kids and a steady income and a terrible reputation.<br/><br/>So in play, everybody is fucking with my guy, and he has no tools to reliably stop them.  His edges are Straight (as in, not a criminal) and Slumlord, and his connection is to a CPD community policing officer who has a hate-on for him.  He can't go around beating up people who richly deserve it (the drug trash dating his daughter, the Vietnamese gangster who is hassling him), he can't control his kids (who are bargaining chips between him and their momma, who he still loves), he's got pretty much no juice.  It's awful and wonderful.  All my instincts are to make him active, a bad-ass, hardened by prison and ready to solve his problems with an aluminum bat, but he absolutely can't.  This episode I skated by on fan mail, barely winning a couple of really crucial conflicts and losing another one hard.  It's surprising how visceral playing this guy is - I really feel for him, and when his wife (quite reasonably) threatened to restrict his contact with the kids, I could see how he could grow to hate her.  <br/><br/>No point here, really, except to illustrate how fun it can be to play against type, either as a player or within a character's own story.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198496/#Comment_198496" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T07:51:43+00:00" title="March 24, 2009  7:51AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2009 7:53AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience it seems like playing against type takes a lot of energy- it's hard to do if you come to the table tired or distracted.  It's much too easy to fall into old patterns and play like you've played most of your characters, whether that's violent, heroic, calculating, self-destructive or whatever.  Over the course of a longer game, it seems like the chances of everyone's basic type surfacing runs pretty high. <br/><br/>So, uh, good luck keeping that baseball bat in the closet.  <br/><br/>I agree though- when you can make it happen, playing against type can be a lot of fun.  I had a great time playing the undermining, irritating jerk, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198534/#Comment_198534" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T10:26:59+00:00" title="March 24, 2009 10:26AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear ya on this one, Jason. I am big on playing against type--meaning as character archetype--which is sort of MY type--as a player. Some quick examples from recent play (recent = past three years or so):<br/>* A DitV Dog that wouldn't use weapons against another human - Now, I'm sure that's SOME kind of type, but it ain't the Vanilla Dogs (gunslinging teenager for Jeebus, with licenses to kill).<br/><br/>* An Aberrant hero who craved only more and more power (Elemental Control -&gt; Elemental Mastery), disregarding how it was driving him to the "dark side" (8 Taint to begin: solid water--he'd actually put tropical fish and/or food coloring into himself, for public relations events--and a weird bubbling, booming, surf-like voice).<br/><br/>Now, sure, antiheroes are a "type," but this game was setup as a "goodie-goodie super group" and I thought, "OK, my guy is going to be Bad Ass with a capital B.A. (Baracas!) and use that to REALLY change the world for the better." And, of course, near the end of his story arc in this campaign, he's beginning to be able to shape the world's oceans and cares more about them than the "dirt-side" humans with whom he has nothing left in common. By the end of my play in the campaign, when the group would all be winging about how to find or handle a new threat, he'd simply say, "I am a weapon. Aim me."<br/><br/>* Wizards are traditionally reclusive and secretive, right? In Burning Wheel, I decided to play my Unsavory Madman trait a bit in the other direction: Lord Magus Gyric was determined to become "the greatest Battle Mage in the world" (Belief) and went to great pains to let every enemy he faced know who had just blown the shit out of them with Rain of Fire (Instinct), even to the point of returning while allies retreat the scene, to blast a few more folks.<br/><br/>Hmmm... but I suppose that, too, is a bit of a type, in some approaches to high fantasy. Just not what I imagine as "vanilla" BW, where the sorcerers are all occult figures meddling behind the scenes, and the Faithful take the foreground in popular appearances (even if only as frontmen for royalty).<br/><br/>Anyhow, yeah... it's cool to break the stereotypes and challenge oneself to find new tropes and method. For me, that is mainly channeled by acting, but it also can be embedded in mechanical design of a character, like your PTA guy's setup must be, and like my (forced by the system, or by what i wanted from the system) 8-taint hero.<br/><br/>Thought-provoking AP thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198543/#Comment_198543" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T10:52:04+00:00" title="March 24, 2009 10:52AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2009 11:05AM by JDCorley.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious about this - how did you identify the type you were playing against, and when did you decide to play against it?

Mind you, I could hurl a LOT of dice if we stayed in Just Talking and Physical, so it wasn't such a hamstringing. I also knew it would put me into more Dog-on-Dog conflicts, which I find more interesting than a Dogpile on the GM-run NPCs.<br/><br/>So I guess I had anti-type at the forefront, with an anticipated mechanical and inter-player impact.<br/><br/>* I identified my anti-hero opportunity when I totaled up my Taint after getting the powers that I felt defined my "Eco Warrior" sort of character concept. And it turned out HIGH (like, 8 out of 10, where 10 = NPC). So I had to take all these aberrations (solid liquid body was almost a bonus, but I digress) and I ended up, per mechanical factors, more than a little disturbing to the average Joe. Which meant the average Joe treated me differently than the no- and low-Taint other PCs, in public encounters. Which I could use to become more and more alienated in the fiction.<br/><br/>I suppose, in retrospect, I knew I was treading water (heh) with remaining truly heroic. But it didn't totally emerge as playing against the Golden Age Super Hero type until I had some session in which the public and media treated me as less than human, as a disturbing curiosity, if not an outright monster.<br/><br/>* The Unsavory Madman was dragging me SO into the usual lines that I fought back right during character gen, even as I chose my final Lifepath. No high tower for ME! I'm going to create new rivers with the blood of my enemies! I will serve the lords of my homeland in the way only I can: like the artillery piece I built myself to be (I had a LOT of Resources, and most were in KABOOM spells). Thus came the Belief, and the Instinct, and the anti-type. Recognized before the first session, and pinged like mad every session I could (it's hard to get "famous" with undead elves, though, so not every session).<br/><br/>Had that game survived a few more session, I expected to resolve that Belief-qua-goal, for possibly even a Deeds point (e.g. had I turned the tide in a key battle, saving much of my homeland's people) but at least for a Persona. Of course, I could have as easily slid into Infamous, as those allies around me grew to fear me more than love me. But that would have been typical.<br/><br/>(Additional Note: my "swing thought" getting into character each session was <a href="http://www.lfgcomic.com/page/3" rel="nofollow">Richard from Looking for Group</a>, with a more royal angle.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198554/#Comment_198554" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T11:35:24+00:00" title="March 24, 2009 11:35AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, I'm glad to have a general conversation.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I'm curious about this - how did you identify the type you were playing against, and when did you decide to play against it?

Here's what I think happened.  Once we started playing, all the tools I wanted to use to solve my guy's problems turned out to be tools that he didn't have, and I realized that I had a stereotype in my mind that he just wasn't, and that was pretty cool.  Me wanting to fall back on those stereotypes (and I did in one conflict to good effect) provided a lot of interesting tension.  <br/><br/>The episode ended with him facing off against the (protagonist) scumbag who is dating his daughter, and discovering that the scumbag was calling his bluff - all his intimidation and reliance on his bad rep in the neighborhood was nothing; he'd never raise that bat, and the power in the relationship shifted seismically.  I really just wanted to use that bat and tackle the problem directly, but in a beat-down he'd get one card.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198597/#Comment_198597" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T14:36:56+00:00" title="March 24, 2009  2:36PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm including as explicit advice in the Pentasystem "play at least one of your attributes against type".

The other is playing against a type that you usually play, which Jason isn't, in this case (the fatally flawed guy? Totally you, JM).<br/><br/>Also, unlike David's examples, Jason isn't actively fighting against a perceived stricture on the character from the rules or setting during character creation. All of his compromises and playing against type came directly from play. I think this has served to put him right in the middle fo the story, with lots of juicy weaknesses for me to exploit as Producer. Also, by accepting a Production style where the character is pressured to be somewhat dynamic (open to change/reinterpretation), he has really found an interesting core for his character.<br/><br/>(EDIT: Corrected a name)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198628/#Comment_198628" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T18:08:51+00:00" title="March 24, 2009  6:08PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for clarifying Remi, that is exactly right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198659/#Comment_198659" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T00:01:58+00:00" title="March 25, 2009 12:01AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting stuff!

It was probably the most visceral experience I've had role-playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>(Man... I still get a sinking feeling just thinking about it.)</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI was playing what could be considered a min-maxed bad ass. He was all about the physical and the violent, and nothing else. In fights, he was near unstoppable. But what happened? The one thing he was totally unequipped to deal with:<i> He fell in love with a woman that existed only in the dream world.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIn my case---and I'll let Jason decide if it's also true for him---I don't think the visceral reaction I got was necessarily about "playing against type." Rather, I think it was more that the character's tools worked against his goal, creating a sense of powerlessness or tragedy. This amplified the tension between love and violence, creating a real sense of unfulfilled longing. (Which was all amplified even further by my own identification with such themes.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198690/#Comment_198690" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T07:58:40+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  7:58AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2009 7:59AM by JDCorley.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, can't it be both?

I really struggle with front-loaded psychology.  I try complex stuff, I try stereotypes, I try quirks but my favourite characters are the ones who emerge in play.  For example, I'm currently playing Space 1889 and I'm playing a stupid member of the nobility and initially I had him down as an imperialist thug, then I had him down as naive but now I find it best to play him as someone who just doesn't think stuff through and acts without worrying about implications.<br><br>I've found this a bit of a struggle as I tend to play quite cerebral characters as it plays to the way I engage with the game.  Conversely, I recently played a bitchy actor and while playing the camp bit became tiring, being incredibly verbally spiteful was great fun as it played into the fact that I'm one of the guys who makes wise-ass comments at the table.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198879/#Comment_198879" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T09:19:14+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  9:19AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm a BIT lost--are we talking playing against an archetype or stereotype common to the genre of fiction in play, or about playing against one's own real-world personality or preferred type of character? I kinda thought the former; because if it's the latter, then I was playing "in my type" for all three examples: someone who's JUST A BIT off-kilter. That also tends to be "against fictional type" for a lot of genres (but by no means all), and so two of the above are, in fact, out of both types.<br><br>And, yeah, it's fun. Harder than just going through the typical motions, but fun. Reminds me of my all-time favorite PC (oh, God, here he goes again...).<br><br>Dat Bum - A Champions "hero" with a 1d6 Penetrating Transform (heh), Always On (heh-heh), Area of Effect Circle (wait, no!) and delusions that (a) he is living in a high fantasy world, not the modern day, and (b) he has a young girl as a ward that he must protect (a "DNPC" that didn't really exist). His name? Well, the first thing he remembers hearing another person say about him--amnesia, of course, else the fantasy-world delusion would constantly be challenged by his memories--was, "No, honey, don't go near 'dat bum!" (Ah, New York....)<br/><br/>So because of his delusion A, I had to constantly (in my own mind, at least) re-imagine whatever the GM was describing. We're getting on a plane? No, it's actually a trained dragon with a long howdah on its back. The high rises of the city? Castles and towers, of course. My fellow heroes? Well, the guy who couldn't be killed (stupid-high PD and ED and Regen) was, of course, a zombie (a friendly one--Dat Bum wasn't into stereotyping folks). The Mr. Big, I-Own-Everything guy? A king. Etc.<br/><br/>Trouble was... that 1d6 Transform meant EVERYTHING around him slowly but surely (at least 1 point a turn, regardless of power defense) shifted to match his delusions. Stay on one street corner long enough, and panic ensues as the "mundanes" see the world around them roll back 700 years (aesthetically, at least). My group? Most of them ended up cosmetically changed (I wouldn't dare rewrite their powers... but I could have. Hell, I could have made them all into flowers....). That pissed some folks off, until it was revealed that I was asked by the GM to be a sort of "demi-GM," helping to drive the story forward with my pervasive, trouble-making power. Then they just grumbled about being surprised (except for the Mr. Big guy who just couldn't STAND that his Armani suits kept turning into jeweled robes and furs).<br/><br/>Anyhow... my point... my point... OH, yeah: playing that type--the delusional--is kind of a trope, for me (remind me to tell you about the guy who had an imaginary plane and manservant, all actually "made possible" by a Psychologically Limited Telekinesis), and it's a VERY tough challenge, to stay "on" for several sessions, to remain proactive and injecting reinterpretations for nearly everything.<br/><br/>Um. Maybe that's food for thought? Heck....                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198916/#Comment_198916" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T10:39:57+00:00" title="March 26, 2009 10:39AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a pretty cool thread one time about "my character type", yeah.

Subverting one part is likely to subvert that outcome too.<br/>OK, I gotcha now.<br/><br/>Certainly in my case (and probably in Jason's case) that came into play. But I guess something I was reacting to in this thread is the implication that all "playing against type" is the same thing. It's not, I think the implementation of the idea makes a big difference. Of particular importance is how the implementation interacts with system and theme.<br/><br/>In its simplest form, "playing against type" is just color ("My DnD barbarian has 12 levels of gourmet cooking!"). Sometimes, "playing against type" means the character is going to have less mechanical resources, or maybe it changes how mechanic resources can be used (like a nerdy intellectual who is drafted into the military, he doesn't have brawn but he can apply his knowledge in novel ways). Other times, "playing against type" has thematic implications (like a tough loner cop who goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher).<br/><br/>And occasionally, you get a really cool synergistic effect, where the mechanical consequences of "playing against type" somehow play into the thematic implications. This is what happened to me, and I think it's happening to Jason. But this sort of synergy is in no way guaranteed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
