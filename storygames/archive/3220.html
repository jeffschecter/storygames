(I've taken a look at the game and I'm sure I'll have fun -- it's a hardwired tactical gamist romp with viciously 'realistic' combat system that averages a PC death every other session or so -- if I go in playing it like a survivalist video game, I'll have fun. But I digress.)<br/><br/>Anyway, the GM calls in sick at the last minute and several of the players bail, leaving five of us.<br/><br/>Now, we're sitting around and just chatting about various things, and one of the players (who's also a writer and actor) and I are talking about story games and how they evolved and what he doesn't like about them and such.<br/><br/>Basically, he's telling me that he really gets his enjoyment out of illusionist, gamist play.  <i>GM's in charge. GM controls the plot. I play my guy and don't talk about meta stuff, and don't make decisions from a meta level, ever.  I like lots of dice hitting the table, the constant threat of death, a big fight to wrap up every session, and that's what's fun.</i><br/><br/>And... I've played with this guy a couple times, and I poke a little at some of his statements (and the corroborating statements from the other folks there), because they don't seem to hold water when compared to actual play I've seen, but the actual play I've seen has been one game where he was GMing the new Paranoia, and a oneshot where I was running TSoY Freebooters, so it's not the best sampling, but still -- there are some clear instances of him going for a 'a cooler story, as perceived by the player at a meta level.'  He concedes that, but says that was just him trying to enjoy what he could out of the system at hand.  It's just not fun for him, long term. <br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>So, in lieu of the GM showing up, I was planning (grinning in the back of my head, because it's SO not a Narr game and totally the kind of simmy dice-rolling deathfest he's talking about) to run a Dead of Night one shot for these guys: a western/Halflife mashup I dreamed up on the plane ride out to NYC that day, and being happy that I was going to give him something that seemed to match right up with what he was asking for.<br/><br/>One of the other guys decides during this talk 'we're not playing yet, so I'm going to grab the bull by the horns and get us on track' and pulls out a oneshot pregen setup for Dread.  (Which is fine: he and I had talked about just throwing both games out on the table and letting people pick.  I knew he was thinking of running something.)<br/><br/>So we played Dread (running a Western/Zombie/Radiation mashup) and had a good time.  Lots of laughter, lots of funny, some fairly creepy stuff, the constant threat of death (the conflict resolution system is pretty much "do you succeed in this task, or die horribly?" from the get-go).<br/><br/>At the end, the player I'd been talking to says "Good time. Lots of fun."<br/><br/>So... at some point in the evening, he's been lying.<br/><br/>Has anyone played Dread?<br/><br/>"Character generation" in this pregen pretty much amounts to answering eight questions that the GM's written down on the sheet for your guy, and then naming the character (note: naming the guy comes last).  I was playing the "young miner", so my questions were: "Why are you sending money to San Francisco every week?" "What was the odd thing you found in the mine a few days ago?"  "Who do you have a crush on in the town?" "Why did you decide on being a miner as your work?"<br/><br/>From those questions, I invented a fiance in SF, a glowing yellow rock I found in the mine, the youngest whore in the bordello in town, and the fact that I was big, strong, and not too smart.   Everyone had questions like this, and everyone filled them out, and the GM read em, nodded, and started up some scenes.<br/><br/>Conflict resolution is a Jenga tower.  To succeed, you have to successfully pull a jenga block and relocate it to the top of the tower without tipping it over.  Harder tasks require more than one pull, and you can do a heroic sacrifice and trash the tower on purpose to succeed, but die in the process (which rule actually created the coolest scene in the session -- and the only PC death).  In short, your character's success is based on your own personal manual dexterity.<br/><br/>So... afterwards, I was talking to the GM, who's done some indie gaming that he's enjoyed (Dogs), some he hasn't (PTA) and he says "All I had for the scenario was the name of the town, those questions on your sheets, and the fact that there will be zombies.  Everything else came from the character sheets."<br/><br/>Which of course I knew.  The young whore ended up being a constantly reincorporated character -- lusted after by everyone and actually the daughter of two of the PCs -- pretty much every element in the story came off a sheet, created by the players.<br/><br/>So... we had:<br/>* Content provided by the players.<br/>* The plot was created by the players. (Insomuch as the cure for the zombie plague was foreshadowed, introduced, and resolved entirely through stuff the players introduced to the game.)<br/>* No dice rolling, and no random element to the resolution system at all. (Unless you take the view that the PLAYERS' successful jenga pulls were at some level a 'successful Dex check," which I don't.)<br/><br/>Basically, after a discussion of what the players didn't enjoy in a game, the GM pulled out a game comprised entirely of all the stuff that the players said they didn't enjoy, but hidden behind the thin illusionist gauze of the character questionnaire, ran it, and everyone said they had fun.<br/><br/>Which means one of three things.<br/>* The players were lying before the game about what they enjoy.<br/>* The players were lying during the game about what was going on.<br/>* The players were lying after the game when they said they had a good time.<br/><br/>In only one of those possible scenarios is anyone lying to anyone but themselves.<br/><br/>Personally?  I think they like the style of play just fine... as long as they don't have to acknowledge they're DOING it.  (Example: the one time I tried adding an element to the fiction overtly ("the zombie's eyes glow kind of yellow"), and the group body language was... let's say... strongly discouraging; a little while later, one of the players <i>announced that the young whore was her daughter, and that the father was another one of the PCs</i>, but did it in character, and everyone accepted it without blinking an eye.)  Ouija-board roleplaying, where no one wants to acknowledge they're moving the pointer?<br/><br/>It always reminds me of this quote:\n<blockquote>The satirical rogue says here<br/>that old men have grey beards, that their faces are<br/>wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and<br/>plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of<br/>wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,<br/>though I most powerfully and potently believe, <b>yet<br/>I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down</b><br/></blockquote>\nThoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73322/#Comment_73322" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T05:13:58+00:00" title="June  2, 2007  5:13AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes people don't know what they actually like.  Sometimes people will choose to be polite rather than tell you that they didn't enjoy a game.  It's impossible for me to say which is which here.<br/><br/>The people not knowing what they really enjoy is a very problematic and interesting subject, though.  Can you trust anything a player tells you about if they enjoyed the game?  It reminds me of a magazine article I was reading about focus groups, where the guy running the groups was saying you could never really trust the information you get from focus groups - politeness, groupthink and the chance that you just got a really skewed sample of participants.  I'm not sure how the focus group people compensate for this, or if they do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73323/#Comment_73323" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T05:21:47+00:00" title="June  2, 2007  5:21AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh...

I think that's what you friend was trying to say.<br/><br/>But also, there is a difference between PTA-stuff and Dread-stuff. It's about how you go about adding certain things to the fiction, the interface for doing so as it were. You compare the group's reaction to youright declaring a statement versus an in-character "reveal" that was decided ad hoc. From my experience in PTA, there's lots of open-ended and plain-to-see "meta" talk that needs to happen: what's your character Issue? what kind of scene do you want? what's happening there? what are the stakes? Whereas you can do that in a different, more subtle (albeit more tricky) fashion without open more meta talk; using the GM role role for that is one way to do it, and it seems like that's what was happening.<br/><br/>So I don't think it's a ouija-board so much a possible preference of covert/subtle/IC methods over overt/meta ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73379/#Comment_73379" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T14:18:42+00:00" title="June  2, 2007  2:18PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only game of Dread I've ever played was by far the most illusionist, GM-fiat run game I've played in recent memory.

I want to first thank you for bringing Dread up. We haven't been formally introduced, but we have several mutual friends (including, I believe, the GM in question). And this seems like a wonderful opportunity to say, "hello."<br/><br/>Generally, most of the player-added content for Dread is introduced before the tower goes live, which is, for me, a significant difference from games like PTA. It is very important in Dread that the player's single greatest resource is his or her own character. So the point of contact between the player and the story is kept as close to the character as possible. Allowing the players to add facts and details in the story that aren't directly related to the character blurs this focus a bit. This could possibly be a sticking point for your player who just wants to play his guy and not talk about meta stuff. <br/><br/>That said, it would be easy to do, if your players don't mind it. Simply allow a player to pull in order to introduce an interesting fact to the story while the tower is live. And in fact, when I host Dread I often do just that. However, because the game certainly works fine without it, and because it is a potential deal-breaker for those who don't care for the "talk about meta stuff," there really isn't much about this in the rulebook.<br/><br/>So, I'm guessing the player in question isn't necessarily misrepresenting his interests, but just being inaccurate. Do you think this timing issues seems on target? Was there some content added by players during play that didn't directly relate to their characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73546/#Comment_73546" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T07:32:07+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  7:32AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doyce,<br/><br/>I dare you to refer the 'liar' player to this discussion, and let him speak for himself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73552/#Comment_73552" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T08:11:58+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  8:11AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2007 8:28AM by Andy.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Shreyas, above (first post, see "So What"?).  <br/><br/>Being judgmental just creates more suffering.  I think the same thing when I watch people call each other on misinformation or lying (like on more unruly message boards): "There's something more complicated going on than just "lying" or "telling the truth". Why do you take it upon yourself to be the Inquisitor?"<br/><br/>Most of the time, when people make choices, particularly on Likes and Dislikes, they may use logic to back up their claims. However logic has precious little to do with the formation of those likes or dislikes.<br/><br/>The vocal guy in my weekly gaming group "doesn't like" a lot of stuff (though he did love SOTC, admittedly, maybe because it was a Different Kind of Gaming than we normally do). Like Savage Worlds, for instance: He didn't like it for various reasons, which he listed.  However, we ran a three session game that he had a blast with. On top of that, most of the stuff he didn't like about it simply wasn't true (it didn't have critical hits, etc). Meanwhile, I can't properly articulate why I don't like GURPS, or similar "generic massive skill-based" systems; my claims about it also apply to other games that I like. It's a feeling, and I wrap my feelings up in words in order to socially construct my reality.  Fun.<br/><br/>Logic =/= Feeling. They usually have little relation. Once we get past that, it's much easier to determine:<br/><br/>* What their feeling on the matter really are, and perhaps why.<br/>* What your own feelings on the matter are: That is, why does it matter.<br/>* And with that, fixing *yourself* to make it not matter anymore.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73556/#Comment_73556" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T08:29:24+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  8:29AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2007 8:30AM by Doyce.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, I'm sorry, I thought I made it fairly clear in my last post that folks had made excellent points that I had processed and was taking to heart, and had gotten what the feedback I was looking for in that regard.

(Though I should note that when I explain the rules to the players, I don't bring this option up and leave it to the players to suggest it.)<br/><br/>And I know you sort of want to see an end to this thread, but I'd like to ask a last question or two for my own edification: Do you think you were satisfied with the amount of player-added content in the beginning? I mean, would it have just been the cherry on top if you could have added the <span style="color: #CCCC33;">yellowy-glowing</span> zombie eyes, or is that the whole sundae?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73659/#Comment_73659" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T15:13:33+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  3:13PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally a cherry on top, Eppy.
