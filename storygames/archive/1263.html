                    Let's start with a definition for a game:<br/>
<br/>
"A game is a structured or semi-structured, contrived recreational activity, usually undertaken for enjoyment (although sometimes for physical or vocational training). A goal that the players try to reach and a set of rules concerning what the players can or cannot do create the challenge and structure in a game, and are thus central to its definition." (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game" rel="nofollow">via Wikipedia</a>)<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to build on this by stating:<br/>
<br/>
All games involve at minimum:  Chance or Challenge (mental or physical)<br/>
<br/>
All games are covered by this definition - including gambling and sports.  Activities without goals, a set of rules, and chance or challenge -- are not games.  For example, according to Will Wright, his Sim City is not a game at all, but a toy. Running around outside is not a game. Tag is a game.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let's look at Roleplaying games.  How many are actually games, and how many are something else entirely.  Which do you consider to have all the requirements for a game -- goals, rules, and chance or challenge?  Which do you think are not games at all, but rather toys or play, with which you might be able to play a game.*<br/>
<br/>
<i>* This of course transfers the need for creating goals and rules to others, such as the group playing the "game".</i><br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, when you look at Wizards of the Coast's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/whatisdnd" rel="nofollow">What is D&amp;D</a> page... it's not entirely clear what the goal is.  Does this mean it's not a game at all? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
So... which are the roleplaying <i>games</i>... and which are just roleplaying? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I've on occasion defined roleplaying in such a way as, by the criteria you are using, it is categorized as a type of game. Of course this factors into the problem with that definition of game. You might be playing as a game, but not playing in a game. Perhaps you should motivate why this distinction is of use, by suggesting what we can predict about non-game RP versus game RP. What does this classification tell us other than self-referentially? <br>

This could be helpful in creating "gateway games" to bring more people into the hobby. Adults rarely take a ball outside and just "play" with it -- throwing it up in the air, laughing, throwing it on the ground and chasing it at random.  Adults frequently play sports involving a ball.<br/>
<br/>
This could be helpful in ensuring everyone at the table is actually playing the same game.  The terms "Min/Maxer" or "Munchkin" are used derisively by some RPG players to describe someone playing in a style they don't like.  If the goal of the game was more apparent (the person with the most gold is the winner / the best roleplaying performer is the winner) this would be less of a problem.<br/>
<br/>
More clearly recognizing what the goal of a game is can help with designing rules around the gameplay itself, as well as making them faster to learn for new players.  If the goal of the game is to create humourous stories, rules about siege engines and their effects on medieval fortifications might not need to be as detailed...                        </div>

Describe a classic game (not RPG or Videogame) that has no goal of any sort.  Even playing the lottery has a goal.<br/>

<br/>
Just "Roleplaying" might be a better term... although I think there *IS* a goal -- and the design of the game could be improved by spending more time thinking about that, and making it more explicit to the player... OR by spending more time up front talking about how you can choose different goals depending on the kind of games you like to play.  Turn a weakness into a strenght.<br/>

Thinking about the weak-points of existing games and thinking about how we might improve them.  Also, read my last post...                        </div>

Tag. Goal: If you are it -- catch someone.  If you are not it -- don't get caught. Variant: The person who's "It" stays it until they tag everyone. Non-game-version: Run around.<br/>

Spin-the-bottle. Goal: Kiss the boy/girl you like.  Non-game-version: Kissing.<br/>

A goal doesn't need to be very complicated, but it needs to exist or it's not a game -- it's just playing.<br/>

* On preview: it's perhaps worth discussing whether the goal of playing house is to realistically portray mom and dad... what would cause one kid to tell the other they weren't playing the game properly?  If one kid started acting like a ninja? Running around shouting?  Not responding to the other kid? Hiding on the other kid?                        </div>

                            I agree with Vaxalon here.  <br><br>You can play Spin-The-Bottle without trying for a particular person to kiss, and it makes no difference for the game.  On a related note, Candyland can be played to "lose" and it makes no difference.  <br><br>Also, Sim City and the Sims pretty thoroughly destroys the idea that "Adults don't just play without predefined goals".  Quite clearly, adults <i>do</i> play with "toys" like these and have fun with them.  In my experience, many people had the experience of playing D&amp;D towards the goal of levelling up as adolescents, and moved on to less goal-oriented RPG play as adults.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm uh, just not really clear what we're hoping to accomplish here. <br><br>Is the hope that understanding that difference will lead to better games? or better roleplaying? Because to the publishers of Sims and SimCity (both wildly successful products) I bet it doesn't matter at all whether you formally consider their products 'toys' or 'games', and I'm pretty sure the people who buy them don't particularly care for the distinction either. What impact can we expect it to have on roleplaying game design for this question to be addressed?  <br><br>I do understand that having something like this to just talk about can, in itself, be entertaining. I suppose you might even say the challenge or goal of being the person to really nail the definition might even make this exercise a game. But I'm having trouble needing the issue resolved. But if you're all having fun, don't let me spoil any of it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Yes. Perhaps. I bet it does (they designed it to be an open ended play environment / toy). I bet they do - gamers know what they're buying.<br/>

Not surprisingly you can play the lottery to "lose" as well and it makes no difference.  They're all based on chance, not a challenge (mental or physical) -- so your actions don't affect the outcome.<br/>

I think Sim City and the Sims is play, and appeals to a different set of people than other more structured play (aka games). I also think that people MAKE games using Sim City and the Sims.  (eg. The biggest city.  The slumiest city. How fast can I destroy it. etc)<br/>

I guarantee there is a goal to the RPG you are playing.  Whether it comes from the game itself, or your group adds it -- it's there.  Maybe it's about telling cool stories, or really good acting -- I don't know.  If there was literally no goal, then a player attempting to reach any sort of goal at all would be equally valid.  There would never be an instance when you would think someone was being an ass and not playing the game properly.<br/>
<br/>
Let's look at it from the other side... if you have no goals, how do you know if someone is doing well or if they are playing poorly?  Even social freeform LARPs have goals -- usually about immersive / authentic atmosphere.                        </div>

I guess I'd just hate for somebody not to make an amazing roleplaying 'toy' because they're concerned it isn't really a 'game'. Most of my favorite games are really toys by the definitions being presented here, and that's probably why I don't see the distinction as particularly helpful. But I'll quit being unhelpful and unsupportive. I hope you're right and I hope it helps somebody make something awesome.                        </div>

                            There's a false dichotomy here between goal-focused and goal-less play.  It's a continuum, with things that are clearly "game" (by Stuart's definition) on one side and clearly "not game" on the other, and making a clear border line that will include only those things you want to include is impossible.    Alexander's unwitting paraphrase of Justice Potter Stewart ( "I can't give you a definition but I know it when I see it" ) is, to my mind, good evidence that a strong definition is impossible.                        </div>

                            I think the continuum idea is very important. Especially as it suggests that the binary distinction of game / not-game is subsumed by the much more flexible idea of goals. On the other hand, goals also need a firmer definition. For example, is a goal an outcome or can a goal be a state or configuration frequently entered? <br>
<br>
Now it may be the case that the game classification has some other implication, for example when people identify play as a game perhaps they approach it with a different mind set? I'm not convinced of something like that, but it is possible. However as is, the game distinction seems only to obfuscate the subject of goals, which itself could use more clarity.<br>

Goal = Game.  A ball has no goal. Sim City has no goal.  Tag has a goal. Golf has a goal.  You can frequently reach your goal "state or configuration frequently entered" during a game of tag.<br/>

Let's not get too bogged down in semantics... I'm not sure that's helpful for anyone wanting to do anything practical with this.  From the Jargon thread it's clear we're going to have some disagreements on the words themselves... :-/<br/>
<br/>
It seems the thing to consider is:<br/>
Some "games" contain an explicit goal.<br/>
Some "games" do not contain an explicit goal, and the players must choose one.<br/>
<br/>
They are all one or the other.  Either a game has an explicit goal included in the rules for that game... or it doesn't.  It doesn't seem reasonable that it could be both...<br/>
Football, Super Mario Brothers, Poker, Chess, the Lottery, Candyland, and Tag are the first type of game.<br/>
Sim City is the second type of game.<br/>
<br/>
The question to consider is -- is an RPG designed as the first type of game -- where the players immediately know what the goal of the game is... or is it the second type of game -- where there is no explicit goal and players must choose one?<br/>
<br/>
Again, the reason for considering this is the impact it has on the way the rules of the game are designed, as well as the preferences some people may have for either the first type of game or the second type of game. Neither type is better than the other, but they are different.                        </div>

                            Oh, that's different than what I understood. Lets start again, and lets all confine ourselves only to RPGs as examples, with the occasional computer game or board game thrown in where it fits.<br/>
<br/>
A few RPGs that (to-me) have end-states associated with a goal:<br/>
Shab-al-hiri roach<br/>
Breaking the Ice (I think)<br/>
D&amp;D tournament events<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
A few RPGs that do not (to me) have clearly defined end-states associated with a goal (other than amusement, naturally):<br/>
Prime Time Adventures<br/>
D&amp;D games in general<br/>
Many other 'traditional' RPGs that follow the D&amp;D model<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
A few RPGs where the presence of end-states is (to-me) debateable:<br/>
World of Warcraft - yeah, there;s level 60, but for many thats where the game begins<br/>
Dogs in the Vineyard - town by town you can win, sort of. but long-term it's about self examination, which doesn't end<br/>
The Shadow of Yesterday - theres transcendance, but I think few players view the game as a race to get there.<br/>
...<br/>
