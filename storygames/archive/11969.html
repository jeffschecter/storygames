The game has been going great on a number of levels, and I think we all had a good time, but there were a few things that happened which I'd like to share. (If you participate in the lumpley games forum on the Forge, you'll find some of my specific questions from this game there, too, in two recent "Questions!" threads.)<br/><br/>1. You know how they say the players will blame the Steward? Oh, boy, is it true. I tried really hard to make a Town where the Steward was implicated, yes, and definitely Proud, but competent and at least potentially in the right, working hard to find a solution to the Town's problems. And, sure enough, the Dogs pull him down, first thing! They want to replace him with "the most boring man in town", I think--not an existing NPC mind you, just, "let's find someone pretty bland, he's bound to do better than this guy." <br/><br/>So, whoever said that about Stewards? Amen.<br/><br/>2. The *players* in this game are awesome, but the Dogs are something of a Dogs GM nightmare! They move in coordinated, thorough efficiency through the Town, like a skilled group of dungeon crawlers with a standard operating procedure. (Which we all really enjoyed, I think, but, boy, does it put some pressure on the GM in order to challenge them! I have some ideas for what I'll throw them up against next...) Also, there's four of them. It didn't take them long *at all* to figure out they're waaaay more effective when they work together. Look:  <br/><br/>They worked together intelligently and coordinated their actions--I believe they were very inspired by the phrase "Three in Authority". I created a Town full of moral ambiguity in preparation for this outcome, figuring they would surely take different sides on certain issues, but they still tended to side with each other in conflicts or just stay out until it was over, even where they disagreed as Dogs, rather than show disunity. For instance, at one point they gathered together a bunch of NPCs and led them into a house, then had each sit down in a separate room. They left one Dog to stay in the house and make sure no one left, and then took the NPCs out to the river one by one and took them on, three-on-one, until they got what they wanted. And the Dog left to stay behind was always the one who might potentially have disagreed with the other three ("You're not impartial enough to interrogate your own grandma. You stay in the house this time, and we'll take her").<br/><br/>That's pretty intense! <br/><br/>Also, I learned this: Take an older lady out to the river, put a cloth over her head and place the barrel of a gun on her forehead until she confesses (and wets herself). Works every time.<br/><br/>3. I think the "mob" rules make a whole lot more sense if you treat the note about "each additional member is a Trait of the mob" as prescriptive and not descriptive. In other words, no matter how big the mob is <i>in the fiction</i>, use the number of Traits you can give the mob to determine how many effective "members" it has. By "effective" I mean, "impacting the mechanics", and use it as a hard limit for yourself as a GM. Does anyone else do it this way?<br/><br/>4. One thing no one ever mentions about Dogs is that escalation depends on what tools you give yourself as a GM, and I just discovered this the hard way. No way I'm going to escalate to Guns if it doesn't make sense in the fiction! So, sometimes it's important to make sure at least some of your NPCs are not senile, pregnant, sick, or babies. It was so much easier to play the tough immigrant dude in conflicts than the old ladies.<br/><br/>5. I'm finding the "quick NPCs" from Vincent's "Dreamation NPCs" post on his blog so much easier than the standard rules for NPC creation. It just moves the game along quicker, and I don't feel like I'm really losing anything. Some people complain about losing Traits, but I just give myself the liberty to hold back a few of the dice sometimes, and roll them in as Traits later if it makes sense. It's the same total number of dice, so there's no balance issue to worry about. And if you care about continuity, you can write down the Traits as you name them, same as with the proto-NPCs.<br/><br/>Mostly I just wanted to share this stuff because it's been really cool and really fun. (But also a real challenge for me: running Dogs for two player is way, way easier...)<br/><br/>I'm very much looking forward to the next Town.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267588/#Comment_267588" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T11:10:23+00:00" title="April 17, 2010 11:10AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2010 11:14AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a milk-sop you are!

Move on to the next and let them return in a few sessions to see the logical consequences of their decisions. The most boring man in town is going to be a powerful tool in the hands of the demons they left partying in that town.<br/><br/>Second, where's the hate, murder, and false priesthood? Where are the possessed dudes with lightning shooting out of their teeth,  or sullen teenagers who read too much?<br/><br/>Third, they left a guy to "guard" free, upstanding, innocent men? Those men should have taken an axe handle to that guy. They violently interrogated old ladies with torture and mock executions? Not in my town, mouthpiece of God or not, says the most badass local and his ten angry brothers, with the demons and their 5d10 of influence spurring them on. <br/><br/>Fourth, there was a guy who had a relationship to a townie and you got no traction from that? They <i>mock executed his grandma</i> and that didn't give him pause? Do these guys care about anything, in real life?<br/><br/>It also seems possible that they are taking their character's roles as factually true rather than religious doctrine in an absolutist way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267592/#Comment_267592" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T11:59:02+00:00" title="April 17, 2010 11:59AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Encourage them to liberally use the Short Term Fallout option...

You're totally right, in a way--I definitely was a bit of a milk-sop in this whole deal, in part by presenting them with a Town that didn't go all the way to the nasty stuff. Instead, I had Murder as a Sin, though, so they rode in to find a young boy washing a bloody dress in the river. But I also was just too tired and missed a couple of good conflicts I could have called on, in retrospect.<br/><br/>Still, it wasn't obvious! For instance, those people in the house--you assume they were men, but they were, rather: a heavily pregnant woman, a man finally reunited (just now, by the Dogs) with his deathly ill young daughter, a sick old lady (who had to be carried to the house), and a young girl who was afraid to show her face on the street for fear of death. I couldn't exactly see them taking an axe handle to the Dog's head, you know? Instead, I had one of the women talk another into doubting (and possibly abandoning) her faith, but the Dogs on watch (two listened in on those women) didn't bite.<br/><br/>They were clever about the grandma thing, too: they did it out of sight and without telling the other Dog. I would have loved to throw that in their faces, but we had to wrap up the game by that point, so it didn't come up (the Town actually took a very LONG time, not a very short time, because I think we all got into playing out the various characters and conversations a great deal).<br/><br/>And clever in other ways, too: they saw I was going to use one of the Dogs' young brother to stir up some trouble if they didn't do something, so they knocked him out and tied him over their horse, to keep him out of their hair! (Actually, it was the Dog who was his older brother who did it, which is doubly interesting!)<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks for the advice! That's good stuff, too.<br/><br/>They all had important relationships in the Town, and all had the potential for significant Dog-against-Dog issues. These came up, definitely! They pretty much all went separate ways when they first got into the Town, but after a few conflicts, I think it sort of dawned on them that things would be a lot easier for them if they coordinated their efforts. I think they chose to put their success as Dogs above their interpersonal struggles (at least for now), which is interesting, too.<br/><br/>The game would also have been very different if we'd had another hour or so to play. [edit: Why? Because then I'd have the consequences off all those actions available to throw at them. As it happened, we had to fast-forward a bit and ignore many of the possible ramifications--like the old lady's interrogation at gunpoint.]<br/><br/>When you use the short-term Fallout option to "spend time alone", does that just mean you separate from the other Dogs, or that you actually sit out the next scene? I bet my players aren't clear on that one either...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267607/#Comment_267607" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T13:55:36+00:00" title="April 17, 2010  1:55PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's nothing wrong with having an easy win for the Dogs, in fact it can be good to do for one of your early towns so they can get the hang of it, and an understanding of their strength.

So the Dogs want to lock up and "guard" a frail old lady? That in itself is a conflict - she's got a strapping son and a pair of strapping-er grandsons who don't appreciate seeing Ida both stressed and disrespected. They say no, it won't happen. Go. The lone Dog is directly confronted with some unspeakable evil. Go. <br/><br/>They want to viciously torture an old woman "in secret"? Nothing's secret. Somebody watches and reports back. Let them know it's happening. Let them see the Mountain People who observe the whole thing and scamper off. Maybe they want to chase them down? Go. Sickly grandma's actively dying from the strain right now. Go. <br/><br/>I guess I'm advocating for aggressive scene framing and pushing conflicts at them as you lay out what's going on (actively revealing the town in play) - and if they refuse to bite, giving them exactly what they want and moving on quickly, because your town isn't presenting them with a complex moral dilemma. Also: Demons, hate and murder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267612/#Comment_267612" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T14:22:08+00:00" title="April 17, 2010  2:22PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so using relatives is an easy way to split the party. Exhibit A:<br/><br/>My husband was running this town where dead people were coming back to life. We'd just determined that this was the work of demons and NOT the King, when we run into another woman who'd been brought back to life. Kit casually mentions at this point "Trav, it's your character's favorite sister. She died ten years ago when you were still a child." Instant party split. The rest of us were like "EXORCISE HER" and Trav was like "HELL NO".<br/><br/>Also, making things bad... It's super fun to have sorcerors, because they can possess totally innocent people and use them as (literal) meat shields in conflicts. I once ran a town where a sorceror had possessed his two sons. The dogs decided to take out the sorceror, so during the conflict I kept taking the blow with the sons, piling as many low dice as I could on them and narrating how it was obvious that the sorceror was making them fight against their will. It was totally awesome because the players were freaking out about having to kill innocent people.<br/><br/>Just because the Dogs have mechanical power to win most conflicts if they work together doesn't mean that you have to let them feel good about their victories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267614/#Comment_267614" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T15:38:40+00:00" title="April 17, 2010  3:38PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome stuff, everyone.<br/><br/>The more I read comments this thread the more I think this Town might have just needed some more time. Because all the stuff you're describing, Jason and Anna, was going on: for instance, we had stuff like this one Dog who hates Mountain People because they ruined his voice. His grandfather had just been killed by a Mountain girl, he finds out as he enters the town. One of the other Dogs is this Mountain girl's old boyfriend. However, by the time we knew we had to wrap up soon, that hadn't had a chance to get far along yet--in-character, neither Dog fully realized the implications just yet.<br/><br/>On top of that, though:<br/><br/>a. I was NOT on top of my game that night. I was tired and barely recovering from some serious sick time, and my brain was clunking along--I realized this when suddenly I was struggling to add two numbers together to figure out a See. I definitely missed some good opportunities. But there weren't many, because:<br/><br/>b. Like I said, the Dogs were thorough and careful (except for knocking out the kid brother!). The grandmother wasn't going to be rescued by her strapping grandsons, because one was the one keeping her there, and the other, well he was the one he'd just knocked out and slung over his horse. Ha!<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm just sharing some thoughts about the game, because it was fun to see the Dogs operate in that way. I'm not at all at a loss about what to do in the next Town--this is not a "Help, I'm drowning!" thread, I'm happy to say.<br/><br/>I'm really hoping to hear more about my first point: have YOU ever run a Town where the Steward wasn't blamed?

In other words, no matter how big the mob is<i>in the fiction</i>, use the number of Traits you can give the mob to determine how many effective "members" it has. By "effective" I mean, "impacting the mechanics", and use it as a hard limit for yourself as a GM. Does anyone else do it this way? </blockquote>\nI do.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>5. I'm finding the "quick NPCs" from Vincent's "Dreamation NPCs" post on his blog so much easier than the standard rules for NPC creation. It just moves the game along quicker, and I don't feel like I'm really losing anything. Some people complain about losing Traits, but I just give myself the liberty to hold back a few of the dice sometimes, and roll them in as Traits later if it makes sense. It's the same total number of dice, so there's no balance issue to worry about. And if you care about continuity, you can write down the Traits as you name them, same as with the proto-NPCs.</blockquote>\nI think on his blog (may have been that same post) Vincent and I discussed how quick NPCs are efficient but played strictly as is become predictable in terms of when they get dice for what. Trait dice are fixed to certain levels of escalation. Which is great for escalating but sometimes you want to hold out as long as possible to increase tension before the big escalation comes.

Because I see two issues:<br/><br/>1. Handling NPCs as a monolithic thing. I'm never entirely sure how other people do this. When you have several NPCs in a conflict, do you roll multiple pools of dice, or always pick one and roll in the others as "help"? I've always rolled just one set of dice as GM, thus far.<br/><br/>2. Who Sees a Raise? Your last bit there, "only had to answer us if we beat our fellow dogs' raises", seems like a different issue. You're talking about Pete's gunshot, which Jasper blocked, right? That's the only instance I remember from the game. In that case, it just didn't make any sense for John Chan (or whoever) to See that as well, because it had been blocked already. Like in IaWA, if someone else's Answer stops a Challenge you were supposed to Answer dead, you don't bother rolling for it.<br/><br/>I agree with your (and others') comments about the length of the session: we'll try a very different kind of Town next week and see how it goes (I have some ideas about how to speed things up), but for the "typical" Town I would recommend taking two sessions per Town with this group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267780/#Comment_267780" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T08:22:41+00:00" title="April 19, 2010  8:22AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>I think on his blog (may have been that same post) Vincent and I discussed how quick NPCs are efficient but played strictly as is become predictable in terms of when they get dice for what.

To be clear, I wasn't rolling in Traits from other NPCs into the "mob"--I was sticking to the constraints for total number of dice. So, I'd throw in an NPC's action as "help", and roll in the two dice they would have added to a mob. The NPC becomes a Trait of the mob in that situation. As far as I am aware, that's "by the book", not a variant rule. (Although the book is silent on whether multiple NPCs involved in a conflict should be handled separately--each with his or her own dice--or as groups.)<br/><br/>In our case, though, it hardly made a difference, because each NPC I brought in elicited shouts of, "Ooh!

(And he seemed to agree with them.)<br/><br/><br/><b>Dogs in Many-on-One Conflicts Against an NPC</b><br/><br/><i>When an NPC makes a Raise against a group of Dogs</i>, you say who has to answer/See. For instance, an NPC shooting a Dog means only that player answers (unless someone wants to jump in the way, or something similarly unlikely appears to be fictionally plausible).<br/><br/>This allows an NPC to hold her own in a conflict, particularly if it's just talking: she can use a single Raise against all the Dogs at once. (She'll be at a serious disadvantage in any situation where numbers are a problem, though, like a physical fight.)<br/><br/>Great. But what about the Dogs' Raises?<br/><br/>In our game, the Dogs would all take turns Raising against the NPC, and pretty quickly the NPC would be out of dice. Not much of a conflict there! Again, makes sense in a physical fight, but not necessarily in a conversation.<br/><br/>In <i>Afraid</i>, which is somewhat like DitV 2.0, Vincent said that an NPC can re-use all their dice when Seeing Raises the Dogs make.<br/><br/>However, this doesn't work: now only the highest Raise made by a player actually needs to be made, and the others are pointless. Why even bother taking your turn? You already know how many dice the NPC has to See with, and they're going to be spent anyway...<br/><br/>So here's the new rule:<br/><br/><i>When an NPC is Seeing Raises from multiple Dogs</i>, the NPC <i>may</i> reuse any dice used to See earlier that round. <i>However</i>, each new See must use <i>at least one new die</i> from the NPC's dice pool.<br/><br/>This makes additional Raises meaningful. The NPC can simply keep all the dice out in front of them, and use that pile until the end of the round, adding a die each time.<br/><br/>This also allows the GM some flexibility in their Sees: she might want to Reverse the Blow against one Dog, but Take the Blow from another Dog's Raise in the same round. The game remains dynamic this way.<br/><br/>(We used this rule in the Dogs game which proceeded after this thread, and it worked wonderfully.)<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
