Just to be clear, in my mind this is referring to when both sides of a conflict agree to outcomes prior to resolution. One issue I've often seen come up among my own play groups over the years is that, in a prenegotiated stakes system as described above, and particularly when there's a GM involved, players can get skittish about "failure consequences". The reasons are fairly obvious to my mind.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that, once you get past abused-player syndrome and fundamental disconnects about sportsmanship, aesthetics and the purpose of roleplaying, the issue really comes down to <i>how you sell your failure consequences</i>. I'm gonna think out loud here for a minute.<br/><br/>In my own games, I tend to look for logical failures: \n<ul>\n<li>if you fail this lockpicking roll, you don't pick the lock fast enough and the guards catch you</li>\n<li>if you fail this persuasion attempt, the bar wench will report back to the Thieves Guild about your snooping</li>\n<li>if you fail this climbing roll, you'll slip and hurt yourself</li>\n</ul>\nYou know the drill.<br/><br/>But the more I think about it, the more I feel like maybe that's not the best way to go. Because if I'm arguing from a logical POV, then I have to deal with disconnects with the logic. I'm probably talking out my ass here, but "setting logic" feels to me like this outside authority to which there is no rational appeal -- you can't email Joss Whedon and ask him about reasonableness in the Firefly universe. You can't call God and ask him about various likely outcomes of a great fall.<br/><br/>I'm thinking, where the system has appropriate hooks available, if maybe I should be selling failure consequences in exactly the same way I sell bangs and plot hooks: by looking at character flags. Like, in BW you have your BITs. It seems to me that if I can come up with a failure that directly addresses a belief, instinct or trait, I'll already have the player on-board because I'm directly offering a way to get paid with Artha for buying my consequence.<br/><br/>So, anyway, that's my experimental strategy going forward. How else have people dealt with the issue of selling failure?<br/><br/>(What I'm not interested in is the inevitably huffy, "If you have to <i>sell</i> you failure consequence, you're not playing with the right players" angle. I fundamentally reject that position.)<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174102/#Comment_174102" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T10:09:24+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 10:09AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 10:11AM by komradebob.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm thinking, where the system has appropriate hooks available, if maybe I should be selling failure consequences in exactly the same way I sell bangs and plot hooks: by looking at character flags.

If I'm presented with a failure option that I can see blooming into fun play, then I'm sold! <br/><br/>Tying failure into important stuff for the character sounds like one good technique to achieve that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174115/#Comment_174115" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T11:21:48+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:21AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Interesting" is an interesting concept, though, isn't it? Like...what's interesting to me might not be interesting to you. Or it might be "interesting" but not especially relevant, which I fear is something I can do very, very easily in an "only roll when it's interesting" type of system like BW. If the "interesting" failure is *obviously* going to lead to fun, yeah, that's a super-easy sell. I guess I'm wired to look for ways to tighten the screws a bit, as opposed to "what's the most totally fun thing that might come out of a failed roll?"<br/><br/>Bob, a fictional example:<br/><br/>Gralak the Orc is a BW character. His player states the intent: "I want to track the enemy tribe through the woods so I can ambush them."<br/><br/>My standard/lazy way of looking at this intent:<br/><br/>Track the enemy: hm...some kind of tracking or hunting roll. Failure probaby along the lines of getting sidetracked or making noise. Turn this into a linked test with the ambush coming up.<br/><br/>Ambush the enemy: Some kind of stealthy roll, linked to the tracking roll. Failure means they're spotted.<br/><br/>That's all totally fine, and with most of my players it'd probably be fine as well. The failures all seem like reasonable extrapolations of the situation.<br/><br/>My revised thinking on this starts by looking at Gralak the Orc's BITs (BW's character flags, for those unfamiliar with the system). I'm looking at a character sheet from my upcoming BW Orcs game so I have a real character to work from.<br/><br/>Hm. He's got "charging blindly" as a trait. And I'm looking at that tracking roll. So I suggest, "On a failure, you lose patience with tracking and just start storming through the woods." I think I'd also indicate that, should that happen, he'd get a Fate as well. Come to think of it, that turns the Trait into a Compel-like thing: either you get what you wanted, or you get a Fate for letting your trait screw things up. That's pretty tasty.<br/><br/>It also suggests that the ambush would be totally a no-go.<br/><br/>This is me just thinking off the cuff. I've never gone through this in my own head before so it's pretty rough around the edges.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174118/#Comment_174118" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T11:33:13+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:33AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty awesome!<br/><br/>A couple of quick questions:<br/>Would you (GM) pick the flag that was relevent, or negotiate that with the player, or let them pick or ...?<br/><br/>Would it be viable to ask the player something like "...Okay, so that's what you want.

That was a weakness I was thinking about after posting -- turning Traits into SotC-style Compels might undermine the effectiveness of them.

I used the word "interesting" particularly because you seemed to be talking about "selling" something--i.e. to the player--so, naturally, whatever the player finds interesting is key. And, yes, pulling on a Key-type mechanic sounds like a good way to find out what's interesting to the player.<br/><br/>I like this approach and will definitely try it.<br/><br/>Alex Duarte's unWritten has something like this built into it:<br/><br/>One of the dice allocations during a conflict determines whether a character acts in accordance to his Aspiration (how he wants to be) or his Inclination (a bad tendency). So, sometimes you might choose to act in accordance with your Aspiration INSTEAD of succeeding at your goal. I really like that part, though I haven't played the game yet to see how it works out.<br/><br/>What makes it more interesting in that case is that following your Inclination (bad tendency) can eventually corrupt your character, making them a BAD person. Which a compel-style situation for failure does as well.<br/><br/>I like it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174129/#Comment_174129" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T11:48:22+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:48AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, you Paul guys are some dirty-hippies, and i mean that in the most positive, admiring sort of way.\n<blockquote>A possible implication: If you can't plausibly tie a BIT into a complication, then maybe you shouldn't be bothering with that roll.

My apologies for banging the BW drum on this -- it's the "prenegotiated stakes" system I know best, so I'm a little blindered right now.<br/><br/>On that note, my feeling is this technique requires a system with explicit character flags. Not every game has that. Like, I don't know that this would be super-useful in, say, a GURPS game where you have disads of a more tactical nature. So even if you had drifted GURPS to an "if you fail..." procedure, you'd still need to make sure the characters had clear flags to grab onto to make this work.<br/><br/>(It's been more than a decade since I've looked at GURPS; my apologies if I'm misremembering or misrepresenting the system.)<br/><br/>Um...let's see. I'm trying to think of other games I currently play that have "if you fail..." procedures. While I totally love it, I've pretty much had to bolt that procedure to my other games. Reign was IME immeasurably improved by adding prenegotiation to it -- in that case, you have a pretty short list from which to draw: your Passions and your Complications, I think.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174314/#Comment_174314" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T10:16:11+00:00" title="October  9, 2008 10:16AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2008 10:18AM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can understand that you need flags to use the technique, but do you really need PreNeg?

Totally rad all around, although I ran into some interesting issues I hadn't thought through. The biggest issue was that different kinds of characters have, in BW at least, different kinds of BITs. No kidding, right? But in our game, we had one Orc shaman and one Troll. The Orc is loaded to the gills with all kinds of colorful, juicy traits. The Troll is a much, much simpler character. So when it came time to talk through the Troll's potential failure, I was really concerned the system wouldn't work -- he only has, like, two or three really complicating flags.<br/><br/>That actually turned out to be something of a bonus, because it helped reinforce the simplicity and singlemindedness of the Troll. It also meant that complications coming from the Troll's story felt and looked much different than those coming out of the shaman's story. Like, the whole session just <i>felt</i> different when one or the other of them were on the scene: When the shaman's doing stuff, we're like "Oh shit, is he gonna go totally batshit? Get obsessed with vengeance? Kill and eat someone?" while on the Troll's turn, we're all "Oh jeez, he's so huge and stubborn -- he's a bull in a china shop." Which really is no different than how the game is supposed to play, only now we have more immediate prompts to get those elements pulled into the fiction.<br/><br/>It also became clear that simply invoking the flag wasn't enough. All the flag (trait in my case) does is provide context to the complication arising from the failure. Because my brain is unpracticed with this, I kept looking for the easy way out: "Okay, so if you fail your <i>naked hatred</i> takes over...no wait. Hm. Let's say your <i>naked hatred</i> makes it impossible for you to hide your true feelings, and the guy you're trying to convince is totally alienated to your cause."<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174554/#Comment_174554" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-11T03:57:09+00:00" title="October 11, 2008  3:57AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>say, a GURPS game where you have disads of a more tactical nature.

Ideally this story can be influenced by all the players, but it plays out according to emotional principles rather than the laws of the universe (which don't always take emotional investment into account. In fact, I think it's been rightly argued that the universe doesn't really care.)  But we, as players, participants and people exploring a game world do care (on some level.)<br/><br/>So a great game like GURPs or CALL of CTHULHU or something like that will focus on creating a really cool alternate reality. But you still might have the same boring time in an alternate reality as the one you know. If you apply story game (I hate that term) techniques to it, however, you can get a bit more bang for your buck out of it.<br/><br/>What if, for instance, you got extra mechanics rewards for playing to your GURPs disadvantages?  What if, instead of your disadvantages being some kind of limitation that was in effect all the time (a very good model of reality) your disadvantages provided you, as a player, bonuses in exchange for failing because of them -  the more signficicant the failure to the story, the bigger the play reward? This reward could be anything from future bonuses to a chance to tell the next part of the story or to control an NPC or get some info or even to reduce the point-buy cost of the disadvantage itself (buying it off or making progress on your emotional problems because of your failure.)<br/><br/>Hey, I was just thinking out loud there, but I might have to try that. I've been looking for a way to encourage players to roleplay their disadvantages in GURPs for ever so long. If you could "buy off" a bit of that disadvantage every time you failed because of it (and learned a little lesson, say) I wonder if players would take them more seriously... reward is always better than punishment, after all... hmmm....<br/><br/>Sorry.

I would agree that the players <i>do</i> need to be on-board with the idea that the roll is resolving a narrative tension rather than game-world physics. I noticed that urge tugging at little at me when I tested it out last night -- most of the character flags that came under consideration had to do with character behaviors, so I had to stop and think about why a character's native behavior might lead them to not achieve their intent.<br/><br/>Physical traits were a little easier for me to think through. Another example: the Troll was attempting to Intimidate his cadre of goblins, but when he failed to do so it was because he looked foolish while his <i>massive</i> (character trait) frame became stuck in a narrow passage. So it was sorta-kinda connected -- you failed to intimidate because you looked like a fool -- but it was tied back to character stuff, not physics stuff. <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
