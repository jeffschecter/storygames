They might have a good idea of the typeof characterostics they wish to portray, but the archetypal role for the story is determined randomly. <br/><br/>1. It don't think it should be possible for more than one player to take on the same role. A good story shouldn't have two heroes because it just gets too morally grey, and there will probably be conflicts out-of-character about which character is the dominant hero.<br/><br/>2. None of the archetypes are required for play. A story doesn't need a hero to be a good story. (On second thoughts, there will probably be a limited range of archetypes to choose from equal to the numbr of players +1, gradually adding more complex or subtle archetypes as more players are introduced into the circle)  <br/><br/>3. Over the course of a story, characters gain benefits for defining their role in the story, and playing their necessary part. These definitions are provided through answering a series of archetypal questions. But, and here's the trick, the defining questions should be open enough that players should have a chance of not knowing who the antagonist is among them until the story reaches it's climax. It should be possible for the shadow to work with the hero until the final betrayal/climax, without other players being any the wiser during the course of the story.<br/><br/>4. The defining questions should help colour a character without pigeonholing them into certain roles. The mentor doesn't have to be an old grey wizard, the trickster could be the barbarian warrior...etc.<br/><br/>5. The story plays out in 5 acts, with 1 question per act.<br/><br/>Here's the ideas I've currently got...<br/><br/>Can anyone think of new archetypes that might fit?<br/><br/>Does anyone think the certain questions don't really fit the archeype?<br/><br/>Any ideas would be appreciated...<br/><br/>Hero<br/>\t1 What stirs you from your mundane life?<br/>\t2 Who do you meet along the way? <br/>\t3 How do you approach the major conflict in the story so far?<br/>\t4 How do you resolve the major conflict in the story so far?<br/>\t5 Do you return to your mundane life?<br/><br/>Mentor<br/>\t1 What prompts you to pass on your life's lessons?<br/>\t2 What are the nature of those lessons and how do you pass them on? <br/>\t3 How do you know when your protege has mastered their studies?<br/>\t4 How isolated do you leave your protege in their moment of truth?<br/>\t5 Do you return to your protege once they have been tested?<br/><br/>Trickster<br/>\t1 Who have you broken from their mundane life?<br/>\t2 How do you escalate things for this person?<br/>\t3 What must they do to prove themelves worthy to you?<br/>\t4 Do they prove themselves?<br/>\t5 Is it time to find a new victim?<br/><br/>Shadow<br/>\t1 What has caused a disruption in your plans?<br/>\t2 Who is going to suffer as a result of plans changing?<br/>\t3 How are you going to make up for lost effort or time?<br/>\t4 How do your new plans change the world? <br/>\t5 How do you make the most of the final outcome?<br/><br/>Threshold Guardian<br/>\t1 What are you protecting?<br/>\t2 Who has threatened to encroach upon this?<br/>\t3 What will you do to stop them?<br/>\t4 Do they pass you?<br/>\t5 Does the threshold still require guarding?<br/><br/>Shapeshifter<br/>\t1 Who is the subject of your masquerade? <br/>\t2 What abilities are you trying to mimic?<br/>\t3 What is the reason for your deception?<br/>\t4 Is the ruse successful?<br/>\t5 What do you do now?<br/><br/>Child<br/>\t1 Who (or what) protects you?<br/>\t2 What has happened to them? <br/>\t3 How are you going to find them again?<br/>\t4 What is preventing you from reaching them?<br/>\t5 Do you really need them after all?<br/><br/>Great Mother<br/>\t1 Who are you protecting?<br/>\t2 Why do they need protection?<br/>\t3 What is preventing you from protecting them now?<br/>\t4 What will you do to restore your protection?<br/>\t5 Do they still need your protection?<br/><br/>Antihero/Vigilante<br/>\t1 What has stirred you to action?<br/>\t2 Who seems to be behind it?<br/>\t3 How are you going to bring them to justice?<br/>\t4 What do you do when they resist?<br/>\t5 Do you really think justice was served?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238947/#Comment_238947" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T21:57:56+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  9:57PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you familiar with <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=19892&amp;it=1&amp;filters=0_0_0_0_0&amp;manufacturers_id=619" rel="nofollow">Mythic Heroes</a> from Bad Axe Games?

I'll take a look, but I'm not sure how much this will help me.<br/><br/>But the game takes a few of it's cues from "A Penny for my Thoughts", except that there is a lot more implied and direct interaction between the players. Instead of a standardised series of questions answered by all the players, each player answers different questions based on the archetype of their character within the story.  There are a few other fundamental differences, but that's the core of the game.<br/><br/>Players interact through a series of scenes where they describe the actions of spirits they are channeling. They might have tried to call on a spirit with a certain appearance or mannerism within the story, not knowing whether they have managed to channel a hero, a villain or something else.<br/><br/>I've been researching Jung and Campbell in my development for the game...so it looks like I might be 'cutting out the middle man' and going directly to the source. It'll be interesting to see where someone else took the ideas though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238961/#Comment_238961" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T02:11:31+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  2:11AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vulpinoid</cite><br/>Mentor<br/>1 What prompts you to pass on your life's lessons?<br/>2 What are the nature of those lessons and how do you pass them on?<br/>3 How do you know when your protege has mastered their studies?<br/>4 How isolated do you leave your protege in their moment of truth?<br/>5 Do you return to your protege once they have been tested?<br/></blockquote>\nVery interesting.

The player may choose to activate the character's power once it has been revealed (this gives a one off bonus in a scene as long as it is related to the events at hand), or may save it up and unleash multiple benefits at once.<br/><br/>I've basically written the questions in the way that made most logical chronological sense to me in a regular story structure, but with this in mind I guess it doesn't really matter what order the questions are answered in. A story could just as easily be told in a traditional narrative structure, in flashbacks, or in some other method.<br/><br/>Whenever it seems to make the most sense within the game to answer the questions, that would be the best time for a revelation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238968/#Comment_238968" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T04:19:01+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  4:19AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps Companion and Young Woman / Love Interent?

I've actually tried to word the questions in a fairly neutral tone, so that the player might choose whether they undertake the role of a benevolent trickster (who breaks a hero out of their established patterns to achieve a greater level of understanding), or a malevolent trickster.<br/><br/>Of course this would depend on whom the trickster has their relations with. A <i>good</i> trickster might be benevolent toward the hero, while malevolent toward the shadow. A bad trickster would have these relationships reversed.<br/><br/>As for the Companion and Young Woman / Love Inherent, yes, those are the kinds of things I'm looking for to round out my troupe of archetypes. (Edit: Though I'm unsure whether it would be better for the game to make them gender specific or gender neutral).<br/><br/>Now to work out some questions that help tie their archetypes into the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238985/#Comment_238985" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T09:35:00+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  9:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gender is difficult, isn't it? Those archetypes are very strongly gendered: the hero is almost always a man, as is the mentor. And sometimes the archetypes change slightly, depending on whether they're male or female. A female trickster is much more likely to be a temptress.<br/><br/>So you have to decide whether you want to use those traditional roles or subvert them. There's no easy answer, really.<br/><br/>I've seen those archetypes described in male and female forms and light and dark forms. So the anti-hero is a dark form of the hero: driven by ego rather than purer motives. You can find a dark form for most of those archetypes.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239037/#Comment_239037" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T20:29:03+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  8:29PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm almost inclined to have a different archetype for male and female lovers, as well as different versions for other prominent genre stereotypes that have been subverted into new forms, but this starts to deviate away from the concept of archetype. It's no longer an archetype is you've got eight different versions of them (permutations of male/female, light/dark, active/passive).<br/><br/>An earlier incarnation of the rules used the archetypal imagery of the major arcana from a tarot deck as the fundamental drive for a character, with a core benefit and weakness associated with the card's traditional affiliations. Four minor arcana would be revealed around the character as the story progressed, if the player took on the flaw associated with a minor arcana, they could gain a benefit associated with the card later in the story. At any stage they could reveal their major arcana, basically baring their soul to the world for a dramatic story push or a last valiant effort.<br/><br/>But a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=28774.0" rel="nofollow">thread about this game</a> on the Forge basically called the idea racist (using tarot in a game inspired by gypsy storytellers is apparently a racist stereotype, rather than simply taking advantage of an established trope).<br/><br/>So that leaves me again with the question of whether I limit the characters to a few core archetypes (no more than 10 or so), allowing these character to truly be explored and developed as the story is revealed...<br/><br/>Or do I expand it out further, giving the characters a lot more pre-loaded symbolism before the story begins?<br/><br/>I think I'll go with the former...keep it simple and allow the complexity to develop through the story not the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239055/#Comment_239055" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-25T05:17:13+00:00" title="October 25, 2009  5:17AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2009 5:20AM by Graham.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like archetypes. The idea reminds me of Misery Bubblegum, which doesn't use archetypes, per se, but stock characters. From starting with Cheerleader or Nerd, you get surprisingly complex characters.<br/><br/>So I'm rereading the Seven Basic Plots, now, with a view to writing the second Play Unsafe book. Here are the archetypes that Christopher Booker lists. I think they're quite helpful. Again, they're gender-specific archetypes, which requires a few decisions.<br/><br/>First, the Dark Figures. They're driven by ego rather than selfless motives:\n<ul><li>The Dark Father: a tyrannical evil male villain. Forceful and direct.</li>\n<li>The Dark Mother: an evil stepmother or witch type. Her evil is much more manipulative and indirect.</li>\n<li>The Dark Rivals: rivals, driven by egotistical motives, who are in competition with the protagonist. Cinderella's Ugly Sisters are a good example.</li>\n<li>The Dark Other Half: someone equally self-seeking, who holds out the possibility of union with the protagonist. A femme fatale.</li>\n<li>The Tempter: a deceiver. Quite possibly a Temptress.</li></ul>\nNow, the Light Figures.\n<ul><li>The Wise Old Man: Obi-Wan Kenobi. A mentor.</li>\n<li>The Anima: Galadriel. </li>\n<li>The Light Father: a good king figure.</li>\n<li>The Light Mother: a good queen.</li>\n<li>The Light Alter-Ego or Companion: someone who assists the protagonist. They come in various forms: The Faithful Companion: someone, like Sam Gamjee, who's essentially indistinguishable from the main character, but loyal to them; 2. The Compensatory Companion: someone, like Hermione Granger, who possesses properties the hero does not; A Party Of Companions: all with different skills.<br/></li><li>The Child: All innocent and stuff.</li>\n<li>The Helpful Animal: Mainly seen with a child protagonist.</li>\n<li>The Trickster: Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Someone whose aim is to "trick" the protagonist into a "higher state of consciousness" (this is Booker's description). The light version of the Tempter.</li></ul>\nAs you can tell, Christopher Booker makes a lot of the male/female distinction, which leads to difficult questions (why shouldn't the Wise Old Man be a woman? And, of course, sometimes this happens, like the Oracle in the Matrix). He also makes much of the idea of a family unit.<br/><br/>Oh, and finally, I like the tarot idea, and I think the major arcana is a great source of archetypes. I do understand that linking a tarot-based game with gypsy storytelling could be culturally insensitive, but the idea of using tarot for archetypes is great.<br/><br/>(Long post. I got carried away.

For example allow a player to tell the story of the two step sisters in a retelling of Cinderella, or allow someone to take on the blanket role of "the dwarves" in Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.<br/><br/>That adds and interesting new dimension that I probably wouldn't have even considered otherwise.<br/><br/>Looking at the list though...where is the hero? Or is the hero simply an ascended form for one of the light archetypes (the specific type of hero determined by the archetype from which they evolved)?<br/><br/>Maybe I should just start reading the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239077/#Comment_239077" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-25T17:01:29+00:00" title="October 25, 2009  5:01PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah! The Hero. Yes. Important. Forgot that.<br/><br/>Yes, the Hero is another archetype. The Hero is more complex with regards to light and dark: he can have light and dark sides. He can even start dark (think Scrooge). If he conquers his dark side and gets in touch with his light side (Scrooge again), it's a happy ending. If he remains in thrall to his dark side (Othello), he is cast off the stage at the end: killed, removed, banished. And it's <i>still</i> a happy ending, but he's not there to see it. Either way, the darkness is banished and light reigns supreme.<br/><br/>I also missed out another archetype: the Heroine, the light feminine archetype.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239112/#Comment_239112" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T05:04:29+00:00" title="October 26, 2009  5:04AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use archetype in Call of Cthulhu, not for player characters necessarily but for theming adventures. So in my d20 Delta Green game I used the Great Mother archetype appearing on the Dark Side as Shub-Niggurath and on the light side as the spirit guardian of a psychic PC (in this case a Princess Diana). Then on a more neutral footing, I had Wonder Woman appear in many different guises as thematic colour (in fancy dress, as Linda Carter, ...).<br/><br/>Using archetypes seems to be a very good way of reinforcing theme and bringing the players with you and its not so constricting that everyone can't find some way to use it. In this sense, it's much better than the old AD&amp;D alignment system with more depth and flexibility.<br/><br/>And if you want character development, perhaps the questions could even stand as progress points. For example, if you start out on the trickster path, you might answer the first two questions on your path through play but then not find a satisfactory answer to the third, forcing your character to reasses their situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239148/#Comment_239148" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T10:15:49+00:00" title="October 26, 2009 10:15AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Gender is difficult, isn't it? Those archetypes are very strongly gendered: the hero is almost always a man, as is the mentor. And sometimes the archetypes change slightly, depending on whether they're male or female. A female trickster is much more likely to be a temptress.<br/><br/>Graham</blockquote>\nI don't think these roles are inherently gender based. There is no reason a male character can't be put in the role of "The Great Mother" the person is just a protector. Think Vin Diesel teaching kindergarden. The others are even less a stretch - Buffy as the Hero, Morgan Lefay as a mentor etc.<br/><br/>It's what the players put into them that counts.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
