I mean, what can you possibly do in one sitting with, say, Burning Empires that will do anything like deliver what a complete arc delivers? I think you will have to find one of the "phases" of the game -- on of the natural high points in the way the story oscillates -- and try to deliver that. To get there you will either have to fabricate precursor material or use a game that delivers something interesting in the first session. The first is the one-shot work you already dislike. The second depends on the system being interesting right out of the gate.<br/><br/>If you record your first session success, though, you can use that as the basis (the precursor material) for a new one-shot. You might be able to relatively cheaply chain successes this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185195/#Comment_185195" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T12:00:20+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 12:00PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, that is very true - choose a gripping point of attack and build something around that in a well-crafted one-shot scenario.

You're right that the prep issues for these sorts of games are severe. It's a matter of how much time does it take for the group to be ready to apply each of the five elements?<br/><br/>COLOR--A few minutes looking at pics<br/><br/>SETTING--A few more minutes skimming maps and/or setting overviews. Helps tremendously if one group member (like Andy) has already put in the time and can explain verbally.<br/><br/>SYSTEM--Can be a big time-sink, but possibly only for one person. Very much depends on how well-written and laid out the rules text is.<br/><br/>CHARACTER--This is usually the albatross that sinks it all. Everyone wants to play, not do math for a few hours. Pre-gen characters will do wonders, but in order to make it work, you NEED the last thing:<br/><br/>SITUATION--With a solid situation in mind (and hopefully something will have captured the imagination during the browsing), the characters are not just a motley collection of individuals. Give them a reason to be in the same situation. Overlap their relationships and desires, very much like In a Wicked Age.<br/><br/>With the <i>right</i> pre-gen characters, and a decent grip on the system &amp; setting beforehand, you can make this sort of pick-up game work. Start with a very basic situation and work from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185204/#Comment_185204" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T12:54:55+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 12:54PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>So yesterday we got together for some gaming, and Andy brought a stack of games and started talking, as he is wont to do, about how awesome Hellas is, and we took one look (it has pictures of people fucking!) and readily agreed.

Then I improv like a mad bastard.<br/><br/>The best technique, per me, is to make a list that you stick in a game book of cool ideas for scenarios that you get as you read the book over.  Basically, it is a mild form of prep that gives you a few story hooks.  Next, to understand any game, I usually make a character or two (just to get and know it) and I keep these around.  When I think I might want to test drive a game, I take one or two of those hooks and the PC sheets I made and I do two more things: I write an intro to the group for players that explains how they know each other (my absolute favorite is a crew of a ship or base of some sort).  The last thing to do is to come up with any opening that gets things moving.  Sometimes, it is in media res and you either come back to explain what happened (or you improve why the situation happened).  Past that, Improv like crazy.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, this a great deal of how I run tad games...  When I do full prep for a session, I usually write-up a shot clock of a fairly illusionist opening that sets the stage, then "Opening credits" (in my head) - this is when I agree to drop the illusionist aspect (which is easy because I have no firm plans past that).  Then I list a bunch of bullet items of the bad guys and major NPCs and who is doing what (an R-map, of sorts, but more activity based since I tend to run action-y things).  Last, I will pull together some art from Google image searches that have a fit for what I am imaging things to look like.  Then, I am done.<br/><br/>Not sure that anyone else would care to do it this way, but it has worked for me.  The problem comes when players get concerned over wanting a character that they made or if they want to understand the games' rules better.  By then, just let people rework or replace characters for next time.  If they have these complaints, the hook is well and baited for a longer term game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185242/#Comment_185242" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T18:16:01+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  6:16PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2008 6:18PM by Graham.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I think you need a good <i>start</i> prepared, rather than a complete one-shot.

From there, the game could last us one session or many.<br/><br/>Similarly, with Dead of Night, I'd use one of Scott's set-ups: perhaps the one where you all arrive at a church without memories. With Hot War, I'd use another of Scott's starts: the one where there's a big box that talks to you. <br/><br/>I might have a couple of other scenes in mind, too. Like, a huge railway station, with steam trains pulling out; a military base with electronic gadgetry; a huge, dusty, underground library. If there was an opportunity to chuck those in, I'd do so.<br/><br/>But, pretty much, I think I'd just need a good start to kick the game into gear.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185250/#Comment_185250" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T19:56:08+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  7:56PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ugh.  Wrestling with the same issue, Jason, and not coming up with lots of definite answers.  With Agora, character creation is stupid-easy, and there's a stacked-situation tutorial thing that starts play.  <em>Presumably</em>, players are enthusiastic about the characters they just made (which playtesting has more or less confirmed) and the rules work in such a way that situation is created by agendas and ideals in juxtaposition (which playtesting hopefully will confirm, once I get the complete rules set out the door...).<br/><br/>Also check out Poison'd (which, despite its size, is a long-term game at its heart), which does this rather admirably.  Also see 3:16, which certainly generates the initial interest and enthusiasm, although I'm unsure if it delivers on its long-term design goals (although I haven't been reading APs recently).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185269/#Comment_185269" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T04:27:35+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  4:27AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, this is helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185280/#Comment_185280" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T06:05:20+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  6:05AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At SGBoston, it's generally the responsibility of whoever's bringing the game to ensure that the group can get some fun out of it in 4 hours or less.  But, yeah, that usually involves some prep time on the part of the person bringing the game.  There have been weeks when I've been excited about something, but not been able to find the time to prep it for play.  As such, the things that get played most often -- PTA, 3:16, Agon, Lacuna, etc. -- are things that 1) don't require much prep, and 2) games that you can learn bit by bit, as you go along, instead of requiring a lot of front-loading of rules and setting content.  Honestly, I think the second one is probably more important than the first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185281/#Comment_185281" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T06:13:35+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  6:13AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what I'm gleaning from this conversation is that if you have a game that demands long-term play or heavy prep for maximum reward, you better provide easily-used material that highlights the good stuff.

In games where character generation is fun play, it might be desirable to make that part of the demo. In games where character generation is fast and drives play, it similarly can be productive to build a character and then wing a session based on the character elements (cf. Reign). In general I think your advice holds true, but there are a lot of edge cases.<br/><br/>Okay maybe not a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185389/#Comment_185389" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T18:38:23+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  6:38PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>Okay maybe not a lot.</blockquote>\nI think that the "long-ass" RPGs where chargen is fast and/or fun are few, if any. Especially if we're talking about first-time play. E.g., making a 1st-level D&amp;D PC is pretty fast <i>if you know the game</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185392/#Comment_185392" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T19:43:34+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  7:43PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Old-school games, though, often have fast chargen and are also designed for long-term play. Classic D&amp;D, TFT, etc. Then they're also relatively easy to prep and often have a pretty focused core scenario.<br/><br/>Here's a general-purpose idea, it's not something I've put into practice. The idea is: have some sort of quick &amp; dirty scaffolding available to fill in the blanks where either the system is too complex for winging it, or the situation in general is too diffuse to pin down quickly and get to the action. I don't know if Universalis can be used this way, as a kind of "shell"; the game I'm thinking of is Mythic. Essentially it provides tools for interactive scenario construction and resolution, based on a combination of player input, GM common sense, some randomness, intuition, and some subtle systemic pressure. In addition, the full version of the game (not just the GM emulator) extends the basic concepts into a simple task resolution system.<br/><br/>So essentially if you needed to whip up an NPC on the fly and do some interaction with a PC, you could use the "GM emulator" to ask questions as necessary about the relevant attributes of the NPC, which could then be fed into the main game's mechanics, or you could roughly translate the main game's characteristics into values within the Mythic task resolution system, and then resolve things there.<br/><br/>The main danger I see of this approach is that people might enjoy the Borg-merged version of the game better than the "real" design, and never move on to implementing the "actual" mechanics to replace the scaffolding. But maybe that wouldn't be so bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185394/#Comment_185394" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T19:58:22+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  7:58PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>Old-school games, though, often have fast chargen and are also designed for long-term play.

If the GM knows the game well and has already made the necessary adjustments, I think people can be introduced to it quickly, and in a form that's somewhat more than just playing D&amp;D while calling it AD&amp;D. (Cf. doing Burning Wheel starting with the hub and gradually introducing the spokes.)<br/><br/>BTW I'm talking about original three books, I don't truck with that UA stuff.<br/><br/>I mean, roll dice however you like, pick a race, pick a class. Your character may be a bit sub-optimal but that hardly matters within the noise of random chargen and all the things that can happen at 1st level. The toughest part of making a new character in any variety of early D&amp;D is shopping for equipment.<br/><br/>But GURPS--I've read things about how easy it is if you use templates, and maybe that'd be a model for prepping other games--make templates plus a few conventions for customizing them, even if the results break the rules slightly. Otherwise, there are just too many decisions for new players to do things quickly.<br/><br/>A final thing, if you go the "hard pregen" route (minimal customization available) I'd think a bit about whether you want to make a ton of them (10 or more, for 3 players) and then wing the scenario based on emergent interactions of the choices, or have fewer while ensuring all of them are appropriate for the prepared scenario.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185402/#Comment_185402" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T22:10:45+00:00" title="December 30, 2008 10:10PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>My question - if you want to be ready to show off games that reward extended play, do you need to have a complete, pre-packed convention one-shot written and ready to go?

That's just the nature of these sorts of games. The best you can hope for is a tight scenario that gives players a taste of what the game contains and helps them decide whether they want to invest the time to delve more deeply.<br/><br/>For instance, The Sword for BW was mentioned upthread. I think we did really well with The Sword. But that scenario will never communicate the coolest things about Burning Wheel. No scenario can. Take a trait vote, for example. It's one of the most powerful elements of the game. After six or more sessions of play, the group will sit down and review the characters. <br/><br/>They'll nominate traits for removal. "Your character has the Determined trait, but when push comes to shove, your character gives up. I think we should remove it." Or "you've really been playing hard against the Psychotic trait, always taking the reasonable approach. I think we should vote that off."<br/><br/>And they'll nominate you for new traits as well: "You never backed down. No matter how much you got beat down, you got up and kept going. I think you should get the Hard as Nails trait." Or "You've been struggling mightily against your Greed, always trying to take the noble path. I'm going to nominate you for Virtuous." Or "That was pretty fucked up the way you just pushed that old man down the stairs. I think you're Unhinged."<br/><br/>And base upon your play over the past weeks, your friends will change your character; not based on what you think the character is, but based on how they've seen and experienced the character. It's a really powerful experience.  They're not just refining your character for you, they're helping to shape how you're going to get rewarded for playing the character in the future.<br/><br/>Even going through that process once or twice isn't really enough to get a real feel for it. You have to go through it several times through months of play, until you start consciously tailoring your play to show your fellow players an aspect of your character so they'll recognize it and reward it with a trait.<br/><br/>There's no way to package that experience into four hours. The best you can do is hint at it so that, hopefully, players who would appreciate that type of experience get intrigued enough by a demo or first scenario that they'll want to explore the game in more depth.<br/><br/>It's definitely one of the most difficult challenges of this sort of game. We see it all the time: "I've read the game and I think it's really cool, but I'll never get my group to play it." Or just as challenging, "My group is really skeptical, but they've agreed to give it a shot. I've really got to knock their socks off though."<br/><br/>We realized pretty early on that if we were going to get over this hump and help our fans sell their friends on the game, the only solution was to provide low-prep, high impact scenarios. <br/><br/>Their friends are correct to be really skeptical, because they're not really being sold on one night of fun. They're being sold on months of playtime. And because of that, they're putting a lot of pressure on the game to deliver right away. They're thinking that it's better that it fail spectacularly in one session than drag out over multiple sessions.<br/><br/>With a strong one-shot scenario, on the other hand, they're not committing to weeks or months of play. It's just going to be one night. And with pre-genned characters, they can feel free to take risks that they might not with characters they made themselves. And then if they enjoy the experience, they can come back to the game and begin exploring its intricacies with an idea of what they're getting into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
