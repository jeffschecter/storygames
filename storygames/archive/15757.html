Our group just played through the Bloodstone Idol adventure over the past few weeks with a different GM, so I'm trying to follow the new DW Beta rules for how to play and create new adventures. I'm personally uncomfortable with a complete "just wing it" style (a <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2011/10/02/the-psychology-of-gm-prep/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> with my thoughts on that general topic) but DW says you're allowed to prep a bit if you want to. Basically, what I want to do is create a small dungeon that I'll be able to use tonight after character creation with the intention of building a more character-question-based campaign after that.<br/><br/>So when I get to the Fronts section of the book I get somewhat confused. Each Front is supposed to have "a few" Dangers (on twitter Sage said 3 is good, 2 is sometimes acceptable). Each Danger needs to have an associated Impending Doom, which implies that each Danger has an agenda (either intentional or just by its nature). I wanted to create a simple kidnap scenario, where a villager is carried off by a small cult to an ancient ruin to perform a ritual. The ruin is currently the nesting place a big territorial lizard in the main entrance chamber and home to a small group of goblins who have found a back entrance into another chamber. The cult is obviously a Danger: they've got an agenda to summon a demon who they think will rebuild an ancient empire (I have a little trouble with this because I don't want to fill in every step along the way to Tyranny with Grim Portents because I doubt it will progress that far, but I think I'm getting the gist of it right). The lizard, however, just wants to live in its nest and control its territory. If it doesn't have adventurers or cultists trying to poke at it, it's perfectly happy with the status quo in the ruin. The goblins <i>maybe</i> have an impending doom of wanting to expand their tribe indefinitely but that seems like a stretch, too. I thought I'd just create a "Current Residents" Danger and stick moves like "Lizard goes out hunting" or "Goblin sets a trap" in there, but since that Danger doesn't have the Impending Doom or Grim Portents stuff associated with it (also confusing: it's slightly ambiguous whether some of these are per-Danger or per-Front) it doesn't seem like a valid Danger. So now I don't have enough Dangers to be a valid Front. But I don't think I <i>want</i> a more involved situation with multiple active agents right now, because I'm just trying to fill a single session. I'd be happy to change any of the stuff I talked about above to make things work, but I'm having a hard time navigating how I'm supposed to be using these rules. Maybe I'm not even supposed to be using these rules for what I'm trying to do.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357371/#Comment_357371" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T13:16:24+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  1:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are the cult and the demon separate dangers?

That would get you two related dangers so things aren't quite so much of a confused tangle.<br/><br/>Alternately, just try with only 1 danger. I suspect it will work fine, it's just that 2-3 is more interesting/exciting. I you think you only need one for what you want, just do one.

Stuff like this just helps us make it better, so thanks!<br/><br/>It sounds like we need a better way of talking about how to split an idea into Fronts and Dangers. What the Front concept is trying to do is make you think about this adventure as a multi-faceted thing, not just one challenge to face. There are a few ways I can see splitting this up:\n<ul>\n<li>If the cult is a bigger entity than just this group of cultists maybe your front is "The Cult of Xar-en-tul" with dangers like "Accidental Summonings" (planar beasties that have crossed over as a side effect) "Circles of Corruption" (the places the cultists worship in) and "Misguided Humans" (the cultists themselves).</li>\n<li>You can also think of the place as a whole as a front. The ruined temple is a danger, as is the cult. The goblins and lizard play into why the ruined temple is a danger: it provides a convenient spot for these kinds of beasts. The impending doom would have to do with the danger drawing in bigger creatures until something the village can't ignore comes along.</li>\n<li>I love the demon/cult divide for making two dangers too. If that reflects how you see the cult that's a great pairing.</li>\n<li>You can also treat the cult itself as two dangers: one danger is the summoning, one is the sacrifice. This implies the two are at least somewhat distinct: they can summon without the sacrifice (but maybe not as well) and they might sacrifice even if they didn't have to to summon.</li>\n</ul>\nAll of those are totally fine ways of making a front from this cult. Which one is right for you depends on which way you imagine these people, which is why we talk about multiple dangers. A front with one danger is flat and the players can pretty much ignore anything that's not part of the obvious danger. With multiple dangers the place comes to life. Making these multiple dangers is a way of making the GM think about what they really want to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357384/#Comment_357384" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T14:19:18+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  2:19PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>It sounds like we need a better way of talking about how to split an idea into Fronts and Dangers.</blockquote>\nYes. I found it hard to understand what I was supposed to do. Like, when I'm creating Dangers, am I supposed to be thinking in terms of the fiction and then mechanizing them or should I be picking from the list and building the fiction around them, some combo of both, etc. It seemed like the section was more describing what things are rather than instructing me what to do, and it wasn't obvious from the descriptions how they were all supposed to fit together.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>You can also think of the place as a whole as a front. The ruined temple is a danger, as is the cult.</blockquote>\nI think I'll go with this one (I don't want to make the cult more involved insidious presence unless the players seem engaged by that idea). I think this idea didn't occur to me because I'm creating a "Dungeon Front", which I put in my notes as the name of the dungeon, so I was mentally trying to find things that were "within" that dungeon front to be dangers. Like, since I already used the ruin as my category it never occurred to me to consider that the same ruin would be an appropriate danger. I might not have had that problem if it was called something else, like an Adventure Front or a Module Front or something.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Making these multiple dangers is a way of making the GM think about what they really want to do.</blockquote>\nWhat I really want to do is follow the rules (I'm a bit compulsive about wanting to do things correctly), so I felt a bit trapped between the rules about using the players answers in the first session to construct a campaign and the rules for creating fronts which seem like they're likely to create multi-session dungeons. I'd be fine creating a more involved dungeon, but the rules (as I read them) tell me I'm not supposed to do that yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357393/#Comment_357393" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T14:51:16+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  2:51PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that most of what Sage said is bang-on, especially about the Cult and the Demon being separate Dangers.  You don't have to, mind you, separate them.  If you aren't interested in the Demon or the Cult are a bunch of Scooby-Doo style bumbling idiot villains, then the Demon won't matter or need to be a Danger in and of itself.<br/><br/>The easiest way to think of the Front is to say "This is the adventure." and to list the important elements of the adventure (power groups, individual dangers, places of power etc) as Dangers within that Front.  Each Danger has an Impending Doom.  If you've ever played Dogs in the Vineyard, there's some advice about town building there that I took to heart when I wrote the Fronts chapter, especially this part.  Think about what would happen in a world where the PCs didn't exist.  The Impending Doom is the end of that bleak path - where the world would end up if the PCs never got in the way.  Think about snowballing each Grim Portent into the next so that the path to the Doom is a natural and progressive one.  They're there to help you incentivize action by the players; if they just sit around on their lazy butts, the Portents come true!  Why wouldn't they?  That's what heroes are for.  Stopping the slow crawl of Dungeon World into disaster.  <br/><br/>So, that's my maxim for all this, I guess; "what would happen if nobody stepped in" = "Grim Portents" and "What would happen if all the Portents came to pass" = Impending Doom.<br/><br/>It's worth thinking about how Fronts contain Dangers but not all Monsters have to be Dangers.  Sometimes a giant lizard is just an inhabitant of a place.  Sometimes it won't do much else but hang around and eat people.  Such is life.  That's fine and don't fret too much about it.  Put some stats on that beast, throw him in your notes and move on.  If, for some crazy reason, he DOES become more significant, you can write up a new Danger for him - either in the Adventure Front or in the larger Campaign Front.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357395/#Comment_357395" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T14:56:10+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  2:56PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We need to clarify our first session v. later sessions rules for sure.<br/><br/>As for Fronts being fictional things that you just clarify or the trigger for making fictional things: both. Sometimes I'll make a front because we've run into these bumbling cultists a few times so, sure, they probably have some larger agenda. Let's make a front!

I'll regularly add notes about stuff the PCs will mention to a Dungeon or Campaign Front as I go.  In a game at GPNW, I asked a player "How do you know what the snake-cultists use to mark themselves?" and he gave me a cool story about being in the cult himself and magic venom and junk so I put together "The Mother Serpent From Whence Comes the Sacred Venom" and put her on the Campaign Front in case I wanted to use her and his backstory later.<br/><br/>The Fronts often end up containing a lot of stuff that you'd normally just write down in your notebook as you play but in a more structured way so that while you're still thinking all the time about things that are happening and could happen, now you're doing it inside a specific framework to help you drive play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357405/#Comment_357405" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T15:22:04+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  3:22PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>The Impending Doom is the end of that bleak path - where the world would end up if the PCs never got in the way.</blockquote>\nI got this part of it. The only problem I had with the relationships between Grim Portents and Impending Dooms is that the Impending Doom section reads like you're supposed to pick from the list. Since the cultist want to summon the demon because they want it to be the emperor of a new empire it seemed like Tyranny was the right answer for Impending Doom. But there are a ton of steps between "demon is summoned" and "Tyranny". For me, the obvious endpoint of the cult's involvement in this adventure "demon is/isn't summoned" (and if the demon is summoned I'd factor that into the next adventure's prep) but "demon is summoned" didn't seem like a valid Impending Doom, so my reading of the rules is that I ought to write out all the intermediate steps to get all the way to Tyranny, but I'm not going to do that because it seems silly to get so detailed about the future of an evil scheme that's likely to be foiled.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>It's worth thinking about how Fronts contain Dangers but not all Monsters have to be Dangers.

Remember to ask them questions so that they are doing some of the heavy lifting - Who asked you to come here?  Are lizards this size common?  You can even add some details of your own by loading the questions - who is so important that you'd come all the way to the ruins of Endria to confront the kidnappers?  You've got some good ideas, the lizard, the goblins, the demon - go ahead and stat those out so that you're ready to throw them in as needed. Consider spicing things up with one or two magic items (e.g.goblin shaman's medicine bag) or some custom moves for situations you think could be interesting (e.g. when you try to interrupt the summoning) and you might want to work toward. Maybe make map of the lizard's den or the goblins' open-air temple so that you can pull them out later but don't worry about trying to map out the whole area, that would restrict your options later and it'll be fun to make maps as you go.  Remember that player's actions and the way they answer questions will always render some of your prep moot because nothing is real until it comes up in the fiction - trying to write out a whole front before the first session might result in additional wasted effort.

Demonic Tyranny is totally something that could bleed from adventure to adventure.  If you think that the Demon will be confronted directly in this adventure, maybe choose a less scary Impending Doom that represents a failure to stop him entering the world.  Then you can, if he gets away, move him to the Campaign Front and set him up for some Tyranny.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357419/#Comment_357419" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T16:14:29+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  4:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>We need to clarify our first session v. later sessions rules for sure.</blockquote>\nA big problem here is that "first session" sounds a lot like the "what is a role playing game" or "advice for new GMs" sections that veteran gamers often skip over.

If everything is loosey-goosey then it completely changes my relationship to the fiction. As I said in my <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2011/10/02/the-psychology-of-gm-prep/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> about the psychology of GM prep, what is or isn't prepped has a big impact on what it feels like to GM a game. For my game, I can't have a Schroedinger's Lizard that might or might not be in the ruin because then I would feel like I'm thinking "do I want to throw a giant lizard at them?". If I know that there's a lizard there whether the PCs go there or not then I can do what the fiction demands, but if the fiction is arbitrary then I can't. Obviously I'm not talking about defining every last detail, but I'm trying to prep the right amount to actually have an enjoyable game. I don't want to be "free" to make everything up on the fly, I want to be free to run the game as a neutral interpreter of the fiction as it develops.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>It sounds like the demon is a Campaign Front.</blockquote>\nI've already decided that I'm creating a Dungeon Front (that's the first decision you ask me to make in the process). I don't want to make any Campaign Fronts before the first session.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>If you think that the Demon will be confronted directly in this adventure</blockquote>\nI don't (and I don't think this particular demon is an active agent in the world before it's summoned). I think the cult will be confronted. I'm hoping that the heroes will stop the cult before they summon the demon, but that's one of the things we're playing to find out.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>maybe choose a less scary Impending Doom that represents a failure to stop him entering the world.</blockquote>\nAs I read the rules, the Impending Dooms were supposed to be in the Tyranny, Pestilence, etc., scope. Personally I think that's the right way to go since it lets you use your Impending Doom to guide you toward what Grim Portents to pick -- I'd be more inclined to break the link between the final Grim Portent happening meaning that the Impending Doom immediately happening. If you can pick smaller things end points for Impending Dooms I don't see why they're distinguished from Grim Portents.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>Then you can, if he gets away, move him to the Campaign Front</blockquote>\nThis was my plan. But the rules as I read them right now imply that I should have that all figured out when I don't think I should figure out stuff that feels like it's outside the scope of a Dungeon Front unless and until the cult becomes a Campaign Front.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357436/#Comment_357436" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T17:49:20+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  5:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read the text, but can you interpret something large-scale (like Tyranny) as an overall motive for a smaller act (like summoning a demon, the first step in some tyrannical plan)?<br/><br/>In that case, the underlying motive is still Tyranny, but the Impending Doom being threatened is not World Domination but just the first step of a cult's movement towards an eventual attempt to Tyrannize the local kingdom or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357440/#Comment_357440" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T17:56:57+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  5:56PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I haven't read the text, but can you interpret something large-scale (like Tyranny) as an overall motive for a smaller act (like summoning a demon, the first step in some tyrannical plan)?<br/><br/>In that case, the underlying motive is still Tyranny, but the Impending Doom being threatened is not World Domination but just the first step of a cult's movement towards an eventual attempt to Tyrannize the local kingdom or whatever.</blockquote>\nYes, in that case Tyranny is the Impending Doom of the Demon and "Be Summoned" is a Grim Portent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357443/#Comment_357443" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T18:28:53+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  6:28PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>Yes, in that case Tyranny is the Impending Doom of the Demon and "Be Summoned" is a Grim Portent.</blockquote>\nYes, this is how I'm doing it: demon is summoned is the last Grim Portent of my cult danger.

A lot of people, when Apocalypse World was first released, said "What the fuck is this?  Why did you dedicate a whole series of chapters to the shit I do, as a GM, all the time, anyway, for every game I play?" and yeah, they weren't wrong about that.  It's a specific sort of way to prepare for a game that supports the other mechanics in as much a thought-pattern way as it does a mechanical one.  Some people, though, don't think quite like that and the formalization of prep is as important for those folks, to get them in line, paradigm-wise, with the game, as mechanics for actual play.<br/><br/>The other thing that, and this is more a personal anecdote, Fronts (and the Moves and Grim Portents and stuff) can help with is responding to the constant barrage of "OHSHITWHATNOW" that a GM can face when you play Dungeon World.  Every failed roll is going to lead to the players looking at you with their big wet eyes a-terror and say "shit, man, what happens?" and you have to respond.  So you look at your GM moves, right?  Maybe those are too vague, so you look at the moves each Danger has.  Those are more helpful - because they're more specific.  On top of that, you're constantly under the guidance of your Fronts, both Dungeon (right now, here in the ruins, during this session and next and maybe one more after that) and Campaign (next month, or in March, or near-the-end) and their Grim Portents and Impending Dooms.  So if you can advance a Portent towards resolution on a failed move - if it makes sense, you do it.  Checking them off feels so good.  If there's a Portent that says "The Goblins capture the Lady Alissandra" and those poor dumb fucker PCs just failed a roll to defend said Lady - you steal her.  You jack her out from under them and you did it because the goblins have a move called "Learn from past encounters and prepare for the next one" and they know, now, how important it is.  Or because they're Goblins and they're part of a Horde and Hordes have the move; "Display a show of dominance" and damned if taking away their pretty lady friend isn't dominance over them.  All that drives towards their Portent being resolved, which is a little part of their Impending Doom coming to pass which they, as an element of a Front, so desperately want to do.<br/><br/>And maybe all that stuff I just said takes place in your brain, not on paper or in any formal way and if so, cool.  This stuff is going to seem like second nature.  If it doesn't, though, and you're the kind of GM that likes a little guidance for those moments where everyone at the table is looking to you to make a move, Fronts are here to organize that stuff and help out. <br/><br/><i>These Fronts are designed to help you organize your thoughts on PC opposition. They\u2019re here to contain your notes, ideas, and plans for these opposing forces. When you\u2019re in a bind your Fronts are where you\u2019re going to turn and say \u201coh, so that\u2019s what I should do\u201d.

Some things will move to a Campaign Front, others will fade away.  Say the Goblin Tribes have "The Ironspear Tribe Asserts Dominance Over the Marsh" as an Impending Doom which would mean those poor Ogres that live nearby don't get to be a Danger anymore.  They're all dead and gone.  That, though, would be the resolution of a Dungeon Front and a Danger being allowed to live out their Impending Doom.<br><br/>Grim Portents advance as the fiction dictates (I know, I know, it sounds like Story Game Cop-Out Time but hear me out).  As the GM, so long as you're fulfilling your agenda / principle obligations, you just check off those Portents as they make sense.  The move "Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask" is especially important.  Be vigilant about their behaviour.  Say things like "If you leave Battlemoor now, on the eve of Grundloch's promise to return, it will fall without you.  You know this in your heart." and when they say "Fuck it." then you get to, offscreen, check off "Battlemoor Falls" on your Grim Portent list on your Campaign Front.<br/><br/>So, check it off when the PCs fail to stop it or don't try, or if they're bested in some way that might lead to it.  Let the narrative guide you.  Think about the situation, review the Portents and when it seems like the right time to check one off, do it.  The world moves forward of its own accord and will seem a much more exciting place, living and breathing, when that happens.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357465/#Comment_357465" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T22:15:16+00:00" title="February  2, 2012 10:15PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also worth noting that while MC moves and front moves and countdown clocks all rock on toast, the system AW has for developing and managing fronts is... just not that hot.

Forget my AW Fronts.  That said, I've found that when I go back to them, I realize why they're there in the first place.  I'm MCing a game of AW right now and that exact thing just happened - the Fronts really helped me focus what I was doing. What was going on.  They're not universally helpful, but for certain types of GM, I think they can be pretty invaluable.<br/><br/>There are some fundamental differences in the way that Fronts work for DW - I'm finding them, anecdotally, to be a lot more front-of-mind for me when we play.  They're really a more collected, forward-facing (as in, thinking about the future sessions more than the now) form of the usual dungeon notes one might have.  There's definitely some adaption being attempted here. Some of which involves tying them more directly to the fiction; a fun side-note about Grim Portents is that there are ways (spells, items, etc) that the players can access information about them in-fiction and so the GM is going to be prepared to answer those "what does the future hold" kinds of questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357468/#Comment_357468" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T23:07:29+00:00" title="February  2, 2012 11:07PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>There are some fundamental differences in the way that Fronts work for DW - I'm finding them, anecdotally, to be a lot more front-of-mind for me when we play.

I don't use the Fronts system when I run DW. My default GMing style is so similar, if I just do "what's natural" I end up doing stuff that works basically like Grim Portents and Impending Doom, etc. You probably have a similar style. But, like Adam said, not everyone GMs that way and they can get into the groove by following the procedures.<br/><br/>Also, I run lots of different kinds of games, so I have to switch gears a lot. It's nice to be able to refer to the book to remind me what kind of GMing the game wants from me, so I don't accidentally stay in "OSR GM" mode from the Stars Without Number game or "Story Guide" mode from the TSOY game. Even though I don't use the DW Fronts procedures per se, flipping through that section gets my mind right for the game.

It would be nice to be able to look down at my Front notes in the middle of a game (or even between sessions), the way I look down at the MC or Front moves, and easily be like: "Oh yeah, that's obviously what happens."
