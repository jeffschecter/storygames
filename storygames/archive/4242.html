She\xe2\u20ac\u2122s hearing that, in this game, you fall asleep and fight aliens, and that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s an anime game.  So she shows me the pictures and they really are quite good.  I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t mean \xe2\u20ac\u0153good for her age\xe2\u20ac\x9d; I actually mean, \xe2\u20ac\u0153demonstrating skill and technique\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m really impressed, and I tell her so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she asks, \xe2\u20ac\u0153So, can I play <i>Bliss Stage</i> with you?\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nQuickly, I blurt out, \xe2\u20ac\u0153No!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully I kept the combination of panic and laughter out of my voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\xe2\u20ac\u2122s right.  The Peoria Resistance Group is at it again.  Jude finally begins to be a sympathetic character, we discover another resistance group, and we fight nasty aliens that look like flying <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koosh_ball" rel="nofollow">Koosh balls</a>.  So suit up, strap in, and prepare for launch!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s big break</b><br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the last mission, Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Rachel broke.  According to the rules, we needed to have a denouement action to close out that relationship.  So, we led off with that.  Crystal says, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Rachel comes into the base looking for Jude, and she shows up while Jude and Leah are having dinner.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  And so it was.  Joseph catches her trying to sneak in, and he brings her to Jude, right in the middle of his romantic dinner with Leah.  This puts Jude in a difficult place, to be sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Jude goes off from Leah and confronts Rachel, pretty much discarding her like a tramp.  It was pretty harsh, actually, and Joseph was there, watching the whole thing.  In response, Rachel slapped him across the face and then kicked him in the groin.  Joseph was making sure that Rachel didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t escape, but he wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily making sure that she avoided all physical contact with Jude.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter this, Crystal called for an interlude with Jude and Leah.  Jude dragged himself back to dinner and told Leah everything.  He sat there and dumped his entire life into her lap.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she still accepted him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe called this Stress Relief, because it couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be Trust-Building.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Anchor Training</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI can be a sadistic GM.  I admit it.  And so, when the briefing action came down that Jared wanted Jude to train a new anchor, it was fairly obvious who he was being paired up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong the way, Jude started asking Jared questions about this whole \xe2\u20ac\u0153getting married\xe2\u20ac\x9d thing.  Apparently, the group has an old copy of the Book of Common Prayer, and they read through the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1928/Marriage.htm" rel="nofollow">marriage ceremony</a> (at least the bits that aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t water-damaged) to get married.  Jude is suddenly quite interested in this.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, when he arrived at the ANIMa cr\xc3\xa8ches, he saw who he was going to be training.<br/>\n<br/>\nGloria.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Mission Brief</i><br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6begin briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Anchor Training</i><br/>\nForm ANIMa<br/>\nVisualization test<br/>\nGuidance test<br/>\nIf all successful, character is now an anchor<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, uh, yeah.  This didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really go well.  Gloria didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really trust Jude, so she had her knife out on the console when he got back from getting changed into his pilot suit.  Then the mission started.<br/>\n<br/>\nGloria\xe2\u20ac\u2122s inexperience was fairly obvious, but she did okay until the guidance test.  Gloria had Jude turn right around a corner and walked him straight into nightmare.  A dark cloud engulfed his ANIMa.  She tried to back him out, but it was getting worse.  In fact, the chassis took damage, breaking Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Gloria.  The dream started leaking across into the real world.  A black tentacle reached through the fabric of things and groped for Gloria.  She screamed and cut it with her knife.  Then she slapped the panic button.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I recall, Jude completely went off on Gloria before stalking away.  Gloria yelled at him too, then stormed off the other direction.  On the console, the severed tentacle twitched.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Blowing off Steam</b><br/>\nJude blew into Jared\xe2\u20ac\u2122s office and started screaming at him about his incompetence.  Underneath, Jude was afraid.  Very afraid.  He was almost lost in the dream because of Gloria, so he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s turning his fear into the fury that he is venting at Jared.  I called this Trauma Relief.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, Marcus told Beth that he needed to get away for a bit.  So he spent the day away from everyone, not seeing anyone or being needed.  Trauma Relief.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95097/#Comment_95097" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T10:25:56+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 10:25AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>On the Offensive</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSoon thereafter, Jared summoned Marcus and Jude.  He had a major strike for them to accomplish.  He needed them to head north into enemy territory, locate the alien base, and plant another sensor package right in the base itself.  One of them would need to distract the aliens so that the other one could enter the base secretly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Mission Brief</i><br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6begin briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>On the Offensive</i><br/>\n(for two pilots)<br/>\n(Must be done in order)<br/>\nDeploy stealthily (both pilots)<br/>\nIf either pilot failed, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Spot alien patrol\xe2\u20ac\x9d failed<br/>\nSpot alien patrol (either pilot)<br/>\nIf both pilots failed, fight alien patrol (co-op)<br/>\nLocate alien base (either pilot)<br/>\nif either successful,<br/>\ndeploy sensor array (Pilot 1)<br/>\nif successful, allows for long-range warning against alien attack<br/>\ndistract defenders (Pilot 2)<br/>\nif failed, fight alien assault group (Pilot 1)<br/>\nReturn to base without being followed (both pilots)<br/>\nThis is a secret goal<br/>\nIf pilot \xe2\u20ac\u0153ejects\xe2\u20ac\x9d, then one non-pilot character with relationship to pilot enters the Bliss<br/>\nIf either pilot attempted and failed, defend base<br/>\nIf failed, one non-pilot character is harmed (GM\xe2\u20ac\u2122s choice)<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcus went on point and discovered the alien base.  Along the way, he discovered some objects that looked like alien trees.  He and Beth wondered if they were alien growth pods, but they didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have time to investigate.  They noted the coordinates for later.<br/>\n<br/>\nJude had volunteered to be the diversion, because he wanted to impress Leah.  So he attacks from the one side, drawing off a large portion of the alien forces.  Marcus was able to slip inside and plant the sensor package in an orifice within the alien base and escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the pilots were out, the anchors discovered psychic jamming of some kind coming from the alien base.  If the pilots were to be ejected from the dream, the psychic backlash would drop the anchor into the Bliss.  So the pilots needed to withdraw from the alien base the old-fashioned way.  This was easy for Marcus, but Jude had half the alien army on his back.  What would he do?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe headed for the Bigelow Boys headquarters.  The players all laughed when Crystal announced this.  We liked it a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Jude charged into the parking lot of the Cub Foods where the Bigelow Boys had holed up, with alien walkers and flying alien probes hot on his trail.  Then, as Jude watched in disbelief, two Bigelow Boys appeared in the dream.  Then they manifested ANIMas and began to fight the aliens.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all the confusion, Jude escaped.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Weddings and Babies</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIn the wake of this last mission, we had a few interludes.  First, Marcus and Jude had a man-to-man talk about marriage.  Jude was confused and asking questions, which Marcus was doing his best to answer.  This seemed like Trust Building.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we cut to Marcus with his family.  They are on a picnic, celebrating Beth\xe2\u20ac\u2122s pregnancy.  Marcus tells Beth that his initial response to her pregnancy was raw panic, but now he is really happy.  More Trust Building.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the most important interlude was the one with Jude and Joseph.  Jude tracked Joseph down while Joseph was on patrol because Jude wanted to get Joseph\xe2\u20ac\u2122s approval for his marrying Leah.  Jude spilled all this to Joseph.  Joseph thought about it, then stood up and said, \xe2\u20ac\u0153You\xe2\u20ac\u2122re all right.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  Then he walked off.  He meant yes.

So we went straight into a briefing action.  The aliens were retaliating for the previous raid.  Marcus and Jude were each deployed to separate approaches to the base to fend off their assault.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Mission Brief</i><br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6begin briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\n<i> Alien Fury </i><br/>\nProtect non-combatants<br/>\nPrevent damage to base<br/>\nDefeat enemy pilot<br/>\nMust be accomplished last<br/>\nIf any are failed, one non-pilot character is killed (GM\xe2\u20ac\u2122s choice)<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcus managed to do his part, despite some horrific dice rolling by Gabrielle.  Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s battle was more gripping.  We had decided that, in the dream world, alien remotes look like important adult characters in the person\xe2\u20ac\u2122s life.  I bent this a little and made the remote opposing Jude look like Rachel.  He waded into combat with it, first body-checking the remote and then blowing its head off.  Just in case you missed it, the body-checking is all about Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Leah.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut both pilots are starting to wear out.  At the end of this mission, each pilot was between 85-90 Bliss.  The game is beginning to wrap up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Wedding bells</b><br/>\n<br/>\nJude came out of the mission and immediately went to Leah and said, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Do you want to get married?\xe2\u20ac\x9d  It took her a while to realize that he was proposing to her.  But then she said yes.  They hug!  Even though he hadn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t cleaned the cr\xc3\xa8che goo off.  I called this Stress Relief.  I suppose I could have said Intimacy Building, but it seemed better this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeantime, Marcus is just babbling at Beth, exulting in the post-mission rush.  Trauma Relief.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Gabrielle proposed an interlude.  Jude and Leah are over at Marcus and Beth\xe2\u20ac\u2122s apartment.  Jude decides that he wants to get married right then.  Leah is surprised but agrees.  So they all troop down to Jared\xe2\u20ac\u2122s office and say that they want to get married.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom one perspective, it was an awkward wedding.  Jared tried to read the bit from the Book of Common Prayer, but the water damage made it hard to read.  Finally he pointed at Jude and asked, \xe2\u20ac\u0153You want to get married to her?  Forever?  You promise to put up with each other, no matter what?\xe2\u20ac\x9d  Then he pointed at Leah and asked the same questions.  When they said yes, he said, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Good.  Um, by the power vested in me by the city of Peoria and the Peoria Resistance Group, I now pronounce you man and wife.  Go to it.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  Or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJude and Leah didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t kiss very well.  They were too embarrassed.  Finally, Kay pulled out a kazoo and played the Trumpet Voluntaire.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players were all happy.  Yay!  They finally got married!  But I had something in my hip pocket.  So, when Crystal said, \xe2\u20ac\u0153And Eve had confetti ready!\xe2\u20ac\x9d, I said, \xe2\u20ac\u0153No, Eve isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t there.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  But we kept up the party, until later that night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95100/#Comment_95100" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T10:27:20+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 10:27AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>\xe2\u20ac\x9dIt\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not going well\xe2\u20ac\x9d</b><br/>\n<br/>\nJude and Leah had, um, retired for the night when Kay came running to get Marcus.  \xe2\u20ac\u0153Jared needs you right now,\xe2\u20ac\x9d she said.  So Marcus ran after her.  Kay didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t take her to the office; she took him to Jared\xe2\u20ac\u2122s quarters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was blood everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nJared is pacing back and forth, helpless.  \xe2\u20ac\u0153She\xe2\u20ac\u2122s in labor, but it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not going well.  I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know what to do.  You have to help me.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  Beth came in close on Kay\xe2\u20ac\u2122s heels.  She had spent several years living in the library, so she knew what was going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I know enough about birth and pregnancy to know that things can go quite badly.  Crystal knows a lot, so I asked her for some appropriate medical technobabble.  She obliged quite nicely.  Beth looked in on Eve.  \xe2\u20ac\u0153She needs a caesarian.  We need to cut the baby out.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth needed supplies from the nearby hospital.  But, of course, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s inside Bigelow Boy territory.  By this point, word has spread.  Joseph turned up and asked Marcus what was up.  When he found out, he said to Marcus, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Well, let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s go.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nKay wanted to go to help.  So, as twilight crept across the city, the three of them crept out into the ruins.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Hospital Raid</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I saw that it was possible to run missions in the real world, I wanted to give it a spin.  Everyone at the table had known that we would eventually do some sort of raid, but I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t think that any of us were ready for the intensity of the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot even me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Mission Brief</i><br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6begin briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Hospital Raid</i><br/>\n(A real world mission)<br/>\n(must be done in order)<br/>\nEnter hospital without being seen<br/>\nIf failed, fight Bigelow Boys and fail \xe2\u20ac\u0153Return to base without being seen\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\nIf failed, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Locate Medical Supplies\xe2\u20ac\x9d failed and character harmed<br/>\nLocate medical supplies<br/>\nIf failed, Eve dies<br/>\nReturn to base without being seen<br/>\nIf failed, fight Bigelow Boys<br/>\nIf failed, character harmed<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sheet was sitting in front of Gabrielle, since Marcus was the pilot on the mission.  The simple statement \xe2\u20ac\u0153Eve dies\xe2\u20ac\x9d gave an incredible intensity to the mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd did you know that a real-world mission doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have a lot of dice?  We agreed that, once at the hospital, we could call on Beth for dice, but to get in and out, the only dice available were from Joseph and Kay.  Just for clarity, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s four dice, with no anchor rerolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, any significant failure, and Eve dies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ramped up the tension, too.  As they headed north, they found an eight-year old boy, nailed to a wall, with the interlocked Bs of the Bigelow Boys carved into his chest.  Marcus found Kay\xe2\u20ac\u2122s hand and held on tight.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon they arrived in front of the hospital.  Out front was a major gathering of the Bigelow Boys.  It was utter savagery.  I said that they were turning \xe2\u20ac\u0153something\xe2\u20ac\x9d on a spit over the bonfire, but left most of the details implicit.  Later, we agreed that they were eating a person, not for ceremonial reasons, but because it was the available meat.  There was probably gang rape going on around the fire, too.  We never actually <i>said</i> any of this until later; our minds filled in the horrors.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, roll to see if we get caught.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\xe2\u20ac\u2122m the GM, but I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m on edge with everyone else.  It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s like I put the situation into motion earlier in the game, but now I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m just as much a victim of it as everyone else at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe pick up some stress, but we get past the Bigelow Boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally, our missions are loud and boisterous, with loud gunfire and nasty alien creatures.  This time, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re quiet, huddled around the table, hoping that they won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t hear us, praying that the dice won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t betray us.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to find the medical supplies and get out.  We easily find what we needed, but as we prepare to leave, we hear a noise outside the room where we are.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph moves to the door and looks out.  He gestures to us to follow.  We slip down the hall, then wait as Joseph slips ahead.  There is a wet gurgle from the darkness ahead and a quiet thump.  Then Joseph reappears, cleaning his knife and gesturing us forward.  We slip through the darkness, stepping over the body of the Bigelow Boy that Joseph killed, and escape into the safety of our home base.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had the supplies we needed, but no one had the courage to actually perform the surgery.  Finally, Joseph stepped up and did what needed to be done.  Beth held down Eve, while Kay held her head and sang in her ear.  We gathered around her bed and held them up as they walked through this dark valley.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey lived.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer name is Hope.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>At the end of the night</b><br/>\n<br/>\nJude and Leah are away.

I mean, really heavy.  We talked about it a bit afterwards, wondering why.  Yes, we know that the subject material was heavy, but the rest of it has been heavy, too.  Also, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m specifically talking about the mission itself.  Here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s what we came up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of it was that it was so gritty.  Missions in the dreamworld aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t quite \xe2\u20ac\u0153real\xe2\u20ac\x9d, since you can always eject if necessary.  This\xe2\u20ac\xa6this had no easy escape hatch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the aliens are \xe2\u20ac\u0153just\xe2\u20ac\x9d nightmares and enemies.  Humans gone feral are worse somehow.  The aliens are opposed to us, but they aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t bent in the same way that the Bigelow Boys were.  Gabrielle said that Marcus was quite aware of this the whole time.  If they were surrounded and unable to escape, he was going to kill Kay before he let her fall into their hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the city itself had gone feral.  Launching assaults into the dreamworld is still done from the safety of our base.  This involved physically leaving the base and venturing into the dark.<br/>\n<br/>\nUm, yeah.  Let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s move onto other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep forgetting to use Trauma in mission actions.  I probably forget half the time.  I forgot for the entirety of the hospital mission.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not sure how to make sure that I remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe general consensus of my players is that Jared is a loser and a poor leader.  Gabrielle has decided that Marcus will take over once his Bliss hits 108.  Which, given her generally poor die rolls, could be as soon as next engagement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Crystal and Gabrielle have commented that they have a hard time being anchor.  They say that they feel weird stating the obvious to the pilot.  There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s this sense that talking through every little thing is dumb, but then they don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know how much to say.  They are also trying to stay in character as the anchor, which adds some more confusion.  So, got any advice or helpful pointers?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe noticed that we use a lot of body language when roleplaying.  Some of this is just jumpy gestures.  Some of it is specific miming.  For example, during \xe2\u20ac\u0153On the Offensive\xe2\u20ac\x9d, Marcus took cover under one of the alien pod trees.  I told her that there were tentacles draped over her ANIMa, and, to demonstrate, I dangled my arm limply in front of her face.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier in this series, I mentioned that I think that the most important \xe2\u20ac\u0153character\xe2\u20ac\x9d the GM plays is the War.  At this point, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m going to stand by this assertion.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been ramping up the intensity of the missions, often by increasing the impact of failure or by increasing their length.  At the same time, due to increased Trauma and Bliss, the pilots are less able to handle what\xe2\u20ac\u2122s coming at them.  This ramping up creates direct pressure on the relationships within the group, pushing the story through towards its inevitable conclusion.  To be clear, I think that the authority figure is the other important character that the GM needs to play, but I still think that the War is the most important character.  In this game, Jared is mostly a cipher, existing to look foolish and issue orders.  We seem to be doing just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, for some reason, Crystal can roll well in <i>Bliss Stage</i>.  You need to understand that Crystal is quite possibly the world\xe2\u20ac\u2122s worst die roller.  Ralph can testify to this as well.  She can roll a critical failure in games that don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have critical failures.  However, in this game, for some reason, Crystal can roll a handful of dice and come up with nearly all (+) results.  Weird.  Has <i>Bliss Stage</i> cured Crystal\xe2\u20ac\u2122s dice luck?  I guess we will find out when we play <i>Steal Away Jordan</i>.  So, Ben, stay tuned.  You may have an unusual selling point for <i>Bliss Stage</i>.  \xe2\u20ac\u0153Cures bad dice luck!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Closing</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t think that we will be going much further with this game.  Both pilots have 91 Bliss, so they will both bliss out soon; probably during next engagement, in fact.  The end is near.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for now, this is Seth Ben-Ezra, of the Peoria Resistance Group, signing off.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end transmission\xe2\u20ac\xa6                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
