It turned into a magical session. However, not all games I've played have had the same level of magic, even though I incorporated the new technique as a standard.<br/><br/>It wasn't the technique he used in itself. It was us listening and accepting and incorporating that technique, because it felt right at the time. We were a bit scared, we didn't know where it would go, and this heightened our awareness and the creative tension within the group. <br/><br/>Now, we all know about accepting contributions to the fiction. Say yes! Build on others' ideas! Etc.<br/><br/>Is it possible to develop a playstyle that is not about the specific toolbox of techniques you have, but about a philosophy of spontaneous incorporation of techniques? Of saying "yes" to others' mutation of the game you're currently playing? Not in a formalized way, but in a human and spontaneous way.<br/><br/>"The rules of this game will change, as all participants do things that fit. Follow each others' lead. Explore the new territory. Feel your way. Touch others. Find out who you are together."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352110/#Comment_352110" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T05:48:06+00:00" title="December 21, 2011  5:48AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Years ago, I played a campaign-end session of Itras By where each player would set a scene, and describe techniques to be used in that specific scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352114/#Comment_352114" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T06:42:33+00:00" title="December 21, 2011  6:42AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really believe that an emphasis shift away from language that revolves around "game" to one that revolves around "play" is key to that sort of thing, assumming II'm getting the main gist of what you're trying to describe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352115/#Comment_352115" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T06:52:47+00:00" title="December 21, 2011  6:52AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you tell us more about the magical game?

A moment where the things that you've created together blossom into something none of you could have imagined on your own. As though the creative world takes on a life of its own. That's what your story makes me think of, Matthijs. <br/><br/>It can happen in fully structured games that are highly collaborative--Universalis for example often brings in many crazy, possibly unrelated elements, that all of a sudden click into place and the game gains a wholeness. Swords without Master often has this effect: the way you play has you add your ideas and combine them with others, so often, suddenly, something happens that grabs everyone's attention and becomes what the game is about for the rest of the session. <br/><br/>Approaching a game with the intent to be open to what matters to the players, in the moment that they happen rather than determining them ahead of time, or knowing what structures will make it happen, makes you pay attention. And if the play is long term, there is a lot of opportunity for the world to organically take on shapes you'd not dreamed. <br/><br/>Agreed, even beyond what rules you're using, the fact of listening to one another and playing off of that makes for amazing play. Sounds like a principled approach you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352128/#Comment_352128" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T08:55:05+00:00" title="December 21, 2011  8:55AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh my goodness!

In a simple/complex way. <br/><br/>Specifically, I was thinking about it in relation to my cyborg game, because in a game about transformation, what would be cooler than, on the meta level, for the game to change ITSELF.<br/><br/>I can also totally see this applied to a magic game. Hm. I'll have to try this Swords without Master game. <br/><br/>I do believe that part of the magic of this happening in a game is having people be <i>receptive</i> and <i>collaborative</i>, but I think there's a missing ingredient there. The framework maybe, or the clever domino effect of mechanics that guides the players along. The trick that makes you think you're not actually doing it.<br/><br/>(It's fairly clear I don't have an answer. Just more questions.

Actually, you can't make people believe in a philosophy without showing them how to apply it and which are the actual benefits. So you would actually need to write a ruleset that empowers players to apply that philosophy. Don't be afraid of it, players know a ruleset is not a law and that every group of players is free of abiding by it or creating their own. However we're talking here about a ruleset that specifically asks players to follow each other's lead and even perhaps, make their own rules to fit each situation. I also think the idea is quite cool, but as a player I feel that just adds weight to the game's creative tension. <br/>I'm currently working in some mechanic to alleviate it, the idea is that the mechanic once proved and accepted can become a philosophy freely used by players as they please.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352200/#Comment_352200" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T17:54:10+00:00" title="December 21, 2011  5:54PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course it is possible to develop such a playstyle, just how do you communicate this preferred way of playing to your group at hand?

Everyone would get goofy and no little bit chemically altered. Usually at some point, I'd end up doodling a little party chronicle of cartoons and snippets of converstions that had been particularly funny. Since lots of us had some interest in drawing or painting, there was usually a largish sized sketch pad around to use for it.<br/><br/>It became enough of a habit for me that a few of my pals still keep those created that have survived as treasured possessions.<br/><br/>For game purposes, you might try something similar.<br/><br/>It really isn't an organized sort of thing. It's just an almost collage looking collection of funny, cool things that people liked in play. Snippets of dialogue. A quick note about something cool and fun ( not an explanatory paragraph, more like a one sentence description). Stick figure cartoons. Whatever.<br/><br/>Put info about what happened down close to the time it happened, not later when the urge is to analize. and edit.<br/><br/>Then just save it and add to it. Use a new sheet each session. Let anyone write on it, or hand it off t someone that's good at it.<br/><br/>Then, occasionally, let people leaf through it, between or before sessions, to at as a bit of a reminder or to spark memory, or to let new players puzzle over and absorb the group culture by osmosis.<br/><br/>Edit: Sheesh! Talk about unformed thoughts! I forgot to tell you why I thought this might be useful!<br/>1) It encourages a culture of sharing and recording things that other folks did that you thought were note-worthy and which happened spotaneously.<br/>2) It's a messy sort of record, open to all sorts of interpretation and retelling of events (not thefictional events, but the play group events)<br/>3) Because it'smessy, it is a bit confusing to the newcomer. Which, hopefully is good. It means they have their own initial interpretation, but then need to talk to an earlier participant to get the actual story behind the doodle or quote. Hopefully that more rapidly brings the newcomer into the group culture.<br/>4) It's a record of fits and starts and experiments and changes, none of which were intentional, but were ultimately considered important enough to record by someone in the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352240/#Comment_352240" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T07:33:31+00:00" title="December 22, 2011  7:33AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Robert's saying is neat. You obviously can't make this process formal, but you can certainly do things to invite people in to participate and direct them towards participation at the level of techniques.<br/><br/>Maybe something like empty space on a character sheet? It's a regular game with all sorts of mechanical bits, and they're on the sheet. And there's also empty space on that sheet... And this tells you - you can put more stuff on this sheet, stuff that is kind of like the stuff already on it.<br/><br/>Making sure that the invitation is about techniques and not just adding extra colour or samey mechanical game bits is a challenge, but it should be a surmountable one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352255/#Comment_352255" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T09:02:55+00:00" title="December 22, 2011  9:02AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2011 9:04AM by WarriorMonk.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An extra space on the character sheet? hmmm. How about blank pages on the rulebook? This could be a game built by the players, letting them decide their own rules with a little lead or constrain to help the creative process evolve in a certain way. For example, blank pages could have a single instruction like:<br/><br/>-Rules in this page only apply if the players <br/>-Rules on this page would only involve <br/>-This page's content would describe a group of NPCs the PCs have just found. Flip a coin to decide if either they are friend or foe.<br/>-This page should feature only ritual phrases used to stage an scene, add something to an already built scene or interrupt another player that is creating one to add a detail.<br/>-This page will only contain stick-figures of the players and NPCs, along with the relationship tree between them.<br/><br/>Now, there should be no way to take anything out of the book, only ways to add something. However, It can be something added to the rules or to the setting<br/><br/>Some rules will get dissed over others, however once the book is completed you can roll a d100 and use only the rules that appear on that page. You can also reward the players for recalling something written before that can be useful in the current scene, by giving them the narrative control for the rest of the scene.<br/><br/>Now, for this to work the game should start completely rules lite, and it would be cooler for an exploration game, where PCs and players know a little or nothing about the setting. I'm thinking kids went to a portal to a world full of wild magic or a group of people in a gigantic strange madhouse is trying to find their way out and recall how did they got in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352290/#Comment_352290" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T16:01:20+00:00" title="December 22, 2011  4:01PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about.. whenever you zoom in a scene you decide what the scene should be about?

Everyone has the option of bringing stuff, and maybe they did: A hammer and nails, a Ouija board, a veil, a bottle of vodka, a painting of a woman with child. We sit around the table as we discuss before play.<br/><br/>We talk about<i> Playing With Intent </i>(or whatever it's called). We lay out the basics:<br/><br/>- We're here to explore. Our aim is to listen, to incorporate, to build, to listen more. To do what feels right, spontaneously.<br/><br/>- These are (some of) our principles:\n<ul>\n<li>Be attentive! Listen to what the others are doing. Feel what the group is doing, see what the situation is, while playing. </li>\n<li>Stay with it! Don't chicken out on boredom, tension, pain or discomfort. Like massaging a hurt muscle until it warms up, go through it.</li>\n<li>Be in it! Be your character, be your description, be in the situation.</li>\n<li>Take action! Step in and do something. Your character can act. You can use techniques, give instructions, set scenes.</li>\n<li>Challenge! Make others feel alive by providing them with challenges and hurdles.</li>\n<li>See the real people! Help and challenge the actual players. Give them themes they might find interesting, provocative, hard. Scaffold them.</li>\n<li>Sense the spotlight! When someone's doing something cool, help them do it until it's done. When there's not a spotlight, feel free to grab it, or point it at someone.</li>\n</ul>\n- We have loads of roleplaying techniques we know. Let's mention some of them, write them down on a big poster. We put the poster on the wall.<br/><br/>- We generate the seeds: A setting. A basic situation. Some characters. <br/><br/>- We should expect the start to grate. Things can be slow and painful, but warming up we'll get into it. Stay with it!<br/><br/>- We start out with a simple, but functional structure - round-robin scene framing, for example. <br/><br/>- Further play is guided by the principles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352324/#Comment_352324" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T01:20:57+00:00" title="December 23, 2011  1:20AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2011 1:52AM by Sanglorian.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Duh,I just realised you wrote Archipelago!

Things like, "the person who's said the least goes next" and "if they don't want to go next, add a check next to their name and offer them extra spotlight later." I find that saying to myself "challenge the players" only draws blanks, mainly because it's a multiple step process. It's like saying, "build a car" except I don't have the parts, schematics, tools, or a garage. <br/><br/>I really love how in Fiasco you can frame your own scene or let everyone else do it. Couple this with the person who didn't frame the scene gets to end it... pure brilliance! But the take away point is that someone who isn't good being put on the spot creatively has methods to use the group for inspiration and motivation.<br/><br/>I've found the 3 most important principles to teach players of improv type games, more than say yes, is "listen more that you speak", "make decisions that entertain your audience, not just yourself" and "don't plan".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352348/#Comment_352348" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T09:09:47+00:00" title="December 23, 2011  9:09AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on, John!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352349/#Comment_352349" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T09:23:02+00:00" title="December 23, 2011  9:23AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with John; you can only ask creativity and improv from a certain kind of players, others will fill that demand using attitudes and things they've seen in the past, others will simply react to the situation and will freeze if they see nothing on the table. I've also seen people throw some garbage at the story or the system on purpose, probably because they are bored, probably because their instincts for self-protection are too strong they can't get inmersed, whatever. <br/><br/>I keep getting advice to just not play with such people and I still disagree with the idea. In practice I've seen that a solid and clear rulebook, an engaging enough background and a concerned enough GM can keep these players having fun and spreading it. Now if this philosophy of cooperative ends up being something only experienced GMs/ impro actors / impro game designers can play as long as they kick out people that are not like them... then that's the opposite of what the name says.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's impossible to ask creativity and impro from some people. I think that being creative and being able to improv at the table are behaviors that can be learned. And I also believe that the way to learn them isn't only by watching experienced GMs, I think a game with the appropiate rules can compel people into developing those behaviors, into the point where those rules won't be needed anymore.<br/><br/>A huge part of learning is discovering a passion for the thing you are learning, which is what takes you far beyond of what you've seen, what makes you experiment and think on your own, which is precisely what whis philosophy demands on the players. Furthermore, the core of it is spreading the idea that paying attention to the people around you and helping them achieve things can actually improve your fun. It's like teaching people how to be an empath through a game, which sounds actually completely doable to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352350/#Comment_352350" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T09:34:06+00:00" title="December 23, 2011  9:34AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JOHN TOO MANY QUESTIONS<br/><br/>But I think you're highlighting something important (or at least making me think about it): What I want here is a basic attitude towards play. This is made up of a set of principles, probably, or a set of attitudes and reactions and internalized "rules". So it's a (meta) rule set. It can, in theory, be described; in practice, it's almost like a personality trait. Everyone knows what "being extroverted" means, but the more you look at it, the harder it is to describe in concrete, simple, non-ambiguous rules.<br/><br/>I think the attitude of play I'm looking for probably needs to be painted in broad strokes.<br/><br/>(Paulo and others who want to include more people: That's a great goal, but not my primary goal in game design. I would love everyone to play, but I don't have the patience to spend my time honing games that fit everyone and help them get better. I often make games that presuppose a whole lot, but I think I mostly presuppose specific attitudes, certain personality traits, and experience at being human - not specifically gaming experience).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352352/#Comment_352352" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T09:48:17+00:00" title="December 23, 2011  9:48AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2011 9:50AM by jenskot.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: cross posted with Matthijs above.<br/><br/>I want to be clear that I'm not against these ideas or against GM-less play (which usually isn't GM-less). I also don't want to throw monkey wrenches into the early brainstorming of new ideas. It's too easy to kill a baby before it has had a chance to grow into an adult, make mistakes, learn, and be able to defend itself!<br/><br/>What I've noticed is that the players who tend to rock at this sort of play, don't even need explicit principles beyond the skills they already bring with them. I could simply say, "game of thrones, we're wildlings, the next 2 hours is the end of our story, and it will be sad" and bam... the next 2 hours are possibly some of the best roleplaying experiences I've ever had!<br/><br/>So if these amazing players (who do exist, they aren't even fringe examples, I play LARPs and Call of Cthulhu with them every year at Gen Con) don't need principles, who are the principles for? Once we know who the intended players are, we can come up with the most useful principles for them.<br/><br/>My concern over systems that don't have a GM(s), is that they don't compensate for or ignore a lot of what a GM brings to the table. As WarriorMonk says above, I've seen GMs constantly and repeatably take a table of shy and outgoing people, experience and inexperienced people, even people with different play styles... and get them working together to create beautiful experiences. <br/><br/>All the questions I asked above are 100% serious. I want this sort of play that also addresses those questions. If I can create these magical moments with an assortment of people with minimal structure and distributed authority... I'm all for it! I'm excited for it. My money is practically already in your pocket (or whatever currency we want to exchange if any)! <br/><br/>Again to be clear, the above questions aren't meant to be obstructionist. I think they are vital. I want this to succeed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352368/#Comment_352368" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T11:54:49+00:00" title="December 23, 2011 11:54AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't answer all that now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352392/#Comment_352392" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T15:36:18+00:00" title="December 23, 2011  3:36PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally understood.

If you are looking up rules or procedures you are in all likelihood activating the parts of your brain which are not going to help you be creative and spontaneous. The greatest value I find in 'ritual phrases' is that they have the ability to encapsulate a logical structure, but keep your creativity active. In the end it's like riding a bicycle; the more you think about how you are riding, the less capable you are. The trick is to silence the part of your brain which is thinking about what you are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n2: GMs can provide an important leadership role, particularly when a group isn't gelling, but when groups are working well, focus on the GM's exceptionality should diminish. In best groups I have seen or participated in, the GM dissolved into a mere title that one of the players hardly admitted to holding, but in the worst groups, the GM almost always should have been providing stronger leadership and structure to coordinate the group. If you are looking to get your group to create something wonderful, it helps to have a skilled leader who knows when to interject and when not to. However, don't be fooled into thinking that you need an official GM for a player to exert powerful leadership.<br/>\n<br/>\n3: Try to defeat the 'play to win' mindset. Throughout the capitalist world, but particularly in the English-dominated parts of it, the idea of individuals pursuing their own interests to achieve the best for all is prevelant. Unfortunately, this doesn't tend to lead to good play experiences. Story-games have developed a slew of ideas around ideas of helping others to be awesome and failing in an awesome way. Replacing 'game' with 'play' is one way to help here, but so is backing off from mechanics which inspire 'winning' as an enticement to be creative. Well-functioning groups can usually handle the distractions of winning and even build on them to create better experiences, but if you are having difficulty consistently making the magic happen, this can be an important hinderance.<br/>\n<br/>\n4: Know what you are trying to do. I see story play as falling into a range between the points of  games, improvizational acting, and storytelling. I shy away from games as they tend to have a strong bent toward 'winning', so most of my focus is on finding the right balance between acting and storytelling. Acting is immediate and visceral. Good LARP and Jeepform leans into this realm where the focus is on the interactive experience and emotional connection to the role. Storytelling is a bit more structured and cereberal. I don't think that the tools we have developed for cooperative storytelling are nearly as well understood or refined as we might like them to be, but this is the realm where we need to consider pacing and arcs and such and the overall shape of the story becomes much more important. While there are synnergies throughout this spectrum, there are conflicts as well and learning to manage those conflicts can be aided by understanding what sort of activity you are actually trying to accomplish.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find myself rambling a bit so I will cut myself off.

Because... my geekish nature won't let me avoid a list of questions, I guess? And because I know John is a smart and serious guy, and I've learned from him before. So I trust I'll learn something in the attempt to answer.<br/><br/><b>What principles can be implemented to avoid silliness that derails the overall tone? In a setup like this, is tone important?</b><br/>This is a general problem in play with no set authority. Giving everyone tools for saying "stop, too silly" works pretty well - like Archipelago's "Do it differently". Different groups will do different things (I mean, it's supposed to be an open gaming philosophy), but I do want to help those who aim for serious play. Startup is very important as well: A pre-game ritual, collective emotional experience or similar that makes everyone feel serious and bonded can help. (Like, sometimes, the banishing rituals of "Society of Dreamers").<br/><br/><b>How do we create the initial situation as a group? How do we elicit buy in? How do we negotiate different points of view?</b><br/>This is covered pretty well by a lot of games. Collectively, as a group, we can assume that we have a bag of techniques. Maybe someone says "let's do an R-map", or someone says "let's use Anitas garnn\xf8ste" (Norwegian larp technique), or someone says "PC-NPC-PC triangles", or whatever. Or maybe someone starts describing in a soft voice how things are, and others silently nod. You know what I mean? I'm, as always in this thread, talking about a basic attitude towards play where people pick and try techniques deliberately, on the spur of the moment.<br/><br/>Negotiating different points of view: This is where listening comes in, strongly. You must at all times be aware of others' reactions and ideas (as far as humanly possible). When you feel something start to grate, or get that feeling like a rope getting tighter, move more slowly. Look people in the eye. Let them take over. Do it in dialogue, in conversation, in interactive physical play. This way, it's not about my view or your view - it's about what happens when we interact, the synthesis that emerges. We do not stop and say "roll dice!" We pause and look at each other, waiting for a moment for the other to speak, willing to be surprised and follow that surprise.<br/><br/><b>How do we avoid "survival of the fittest" in terms of the loudest / best / most social players gaining more authority or spotlight than everyone else?</b><br/>By spotlight techniques, probably. Making sure to move it around, to not grab it too much. Perhaps, even, phrases like "Shine on this person now".<br/><br/><b>How do we manage pacing?</b><br/>I don't think we do. I think we are open to the experience as it unfolds, without expecting it to necessarily become a story. We can jump in time, if we want. But there's much to be said for unity of time and space - isn't that what they do in Greek drama? Or am I confused? (Well, of course I'm confused. It's what I do.)<br/><br/><b>Who plays the NPCs? Are there NPCs?</b><br/>Anyone and everyone. This, again, depends on the choices we make about techniques. Maybe someone says "You be this guy", or "Let's have these two women meet and see their conversation". Maybe someone stands up, lights a candle, has a solliloquy in the voice of a minor character. Again, techniques chosen in the moment, to explore something specific that someone wants to explore.<br/><br/><b>How do we motivate characters? How do we build situations tied to those motivations?</b><br/>A central conflict is always easy to latch on to. It's an age-old roleplaying tradition that works. We might create one to start with - someone says "let's have an ancient war between demons, that is creeping into the world we know", and someone else says "some of us are demons, but we don't know", and someone else says "and some of us believe we are, but might be wrong".<br/><br/><b>How do we build in the unexpected? Twists?</b><br/>? This one surprises me, and makes me wonder if I've been unclear (duh, obviously I've been unclear). When five people play in a room, using different techniques to explore an improvised narrative, it's going to be twisty all by itself. We actually need something to keep twistiness down a bit. A rule of thumb saying "one plot twist at a time, resolve before moving on" could be good.<br/><br/><b>How do we push when someone instincts say pull? Many naturally move away from drama; how do we short circuit our instincts?</b><br/>We don't. We let them be in the moment and experience play as they like. In a balanced group of four or five people, this won't be a problem. With two or three, however, we might need to pick participants that are active and take initiative. <br/><br/><b>How do we build a safe space?</b><br/>Good question! Answers are welcome. I've been in safe spaces, but how to create them? Starting rituals, showing people you trust them, being open, making sure you're in a closed room with no interruptions/interference, existing real-life relationships... <br/><br/><b>How do we externalize intentions?</b><br/>Not sure what this means.<br/><br/><b>How do we negotiate disagreements?</b><br/>See note above re "listening". We try to see disagreements before they appear, and try to create things together instead of based on one person's idea. We're ready to abandon our ideas anytime to accept whatever else is going on. Nobody has a strong, central vision. Everyone has a piece of a puzzle, and we don't know if we'll even get a coherent picture at the end. It doesn't matter, necessarily, that all pieces fit.<br/><br/><b>How do we remember elements to reincorporate?<br/></b><br/>We accept that some will be lost.<br/><br/><b>How do we remember who everyone is and what's happening?</b><br/>Sometimes, we sit down and plan a little. In "Society of Dreamers", each improvised scene is separated from the next by a sit-down with a oujia board and some notes. Here, we can remind each other of things, ask questions. Little pauses in between the intensity, to help each other move on in the same direction.<br/><br/><b>How do we remember all the principles?</b><br/>Put them on a poster on the wall. Keep them few, focus on the most important ones. Discuss them, with examples, before play.<br/><br/>Thanks, John! I think this helped me, at least.

Lots of fruitful answers! <br/><br/>By "externalize intentions", I mean making subtext transparent. Making the reasons for our words clear. <br/><br/>It's usefulness depends on how we play. Are we mainly speaking in character, first person? Only third person? Do we go in and out of first and third person? Do we only say what our characters say? Do we vocalize unspoken thoughts? Do we somehow reveal the real meaning of our words? <br/><br/>Why and when does this matter?<br/><br/>Sometimes "always in first person" games (which may not apply to your games) can create unintentional communication obstacles. If I'm always talking as my character, the person I'm speaking to may not understand my intentions, especially since many of us are not professional actors and may lack the body language and voice tone techniques to help communicate our meaning. My character may say something sarcastically but the person I'm speaking to may take my words 100% truthfully. Which can be hilarious, but if hilarious isn't the goal, it can be a problem when the person I'm speaking to wants to build on what I've said and we're currently miscommunicating. This is where I usually add some way to externalize intentions to make it clear what's really happening. <br/><br/>Matthijs, thanks again for answering the questions above.

Things like the "twistiness" being inherent when you have so many people playing, exploring and following up on what happens in the world. It is a natural, organic process that we don't often have the time, or freedom, for in traditional and most newer forms of roleplay. <br/><br/>If this was 1999, I think this would likely be a manifesto. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> A poster sounds like a great idea. I've been toying around with the idea of writing up how to play a game like I did with Vincent &amp; Meg, and my long-ago household, the Ennead. Most of what we did was built on the principles your working with here: mutual empowerment, openness to new ideas about what to do and how to do it, building upon what each other person put forward. <br/><br/>I see what you're working on as a base document, simple, clear and inspiring. There would be as many ways to implement this as there are people in the world. And as many more unique expressions of each of those as there are combinations of people playing together.  I'd love to work on a "Ennead Style" play book, that looks to this base <i>Playing with Intention</i> document. It could capture some of the ways that worked for us, and hopefully spark ideas in others that they could take and make their own. <br/><br/>Perhaps, the poster + a collection of techniques would be just perfect. Then if anyone is inspired to write up their style of doing this, those could be examples or model documents. A "what worked for us" kind of thing. And also--what didn't work. Lessons for others to help them learn how to avoid road blocks. And as people play this way, they could be encouraged to make their own document to share how they did it. <br/><br/>We don't have to have all the answers here. This is an invitation that we can simply share and open the door for everyone to find their own way. And help others do the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352557/#Comment_352557" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-27T15:32:49+00:00" title="December 27, 2011  3:32PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If this is what I think it is, I'm reminded of the beginning of Johnstone's *Impro* - apparently, Johnstone didn't like to talk about it, he just liked to do it. So, here, instead of talking about game design, you're just getting in there and designing on the fly and seeing what comes out.<br/><br/>I'm also reminded of one of Vincent's posts about the game he played with Meg and Emily (I don't know why I use their first names, I've never actually met any of these people!) where Emily said "Let's roll dice" and they figured out some conflict mechanics on the fly.<br/><br/>I could think of a zillion reasons why it probably wouldn't work (in particular, there's a sort of a 'physician heal thyself' thing going on - a group doesn't know what it doesn't know, so how is it going to recognize the perfect rule or mechanic which will bring the awesome that we don't even realize is missing) - but it sounds awesome to try!<br/><br/>Something along vaguely similar lines I've wanted to try is rewriting Polaris on-the-fly, because I have this love-hate relationship with Polaris. It's the only game that gives me that lovable Polarisyness, but there are so many things that rub me the wrong way about it. But I don't want to just hack the rules and ask other people to try them out, I want to hack the rules together with people who feel the same about Polaris as I do...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352559/#Comment_352559" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-27T16:04:40+00:00" title="December 27, 2011  4:04PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">@jdfristrom</a> - check out comment <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> for the link to that very specific case you mention in Vincent/Meg/Emily's game.

This is a great, exciting idea, Robert...it's the kind of modular gaming technique I'm always on the hunt for: breaking down storygaming rules into bite-sized pieces so you can mix and match appropriate to your needs, and gradually build on complexity from a very simple starting point, by adding the next obvious thing, one by one.

In which case, a poster listing techniques would be helpful, but would need a (possibly quite large) blank space in which people could add new techniques, either in dry-wipe marker or maybe post-its, or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nE.g. "stand up when things really kick off" as the original example (could I guess be distilled to "use your body language to reinforce the current tone") probably wouldn't feature in a list of commonly used techniques (or would it? I am kind of new to this!), but could then be added onto the poster either in play, as used, or after play, to be used in future sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353405/#Comment_353405" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-07T09:53:16+00:00" title="January  7, 2012  9:53AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            rabalias:<br/>I think that what you're suggesting is absolutely true.
