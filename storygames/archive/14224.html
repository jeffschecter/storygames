Fun at the game table is like 99.9999% the product of <i>everyone participating in the game</i>.  I don't care how great a particular GM is, if the players aren't participating and contributing to the game, there will be no fun in that game.

Story Games is a online forum.  As a term, it's <i>really really bad</i> for talking about games.  Does it include pre-Forge games like Puppetland, Unknown Armies, and Rune?  Does it include fighty games like Agon and 3:16?  Does it include non-Forge indie games like Nobilis?  Does it include "American Jeep" games like A Flower for Mara? Does it include "storytelling" games like Baron Munchausen and Once Upon a Time?  Does it include homages to earlier styles of play like Red Box Hack and Dungeon World?  Honestly, when people say "story games," what I hear them saying is "games that are talked about on the Story Games forum," and even then there was about 6 months where we talked mostly about 4E.<br/><br/>And "better" used by itself is also super unclear.  Better at what?<br/><br/>Are you saying that <i>some games that get talked about on Story Games are better at providing you with certain kinds of play experiences than the other games you've played before</i>?  If so, cool. But that shouldn't really be controversial or something to take pride in, necessarily.<br/><br/>Please, please don't use "story games" as a flag that you wave or use to beat on other games.  Indie games have enough cultural politics going on already and, honestly, I feel like that stuff's gotten somewhat better in recent years.

It was never my intent to hijack your thread.  I just think there's an strange divide where most folks who've been involved with indie games since the early 2000s hardly ever use "story games" in the restrictive sense, to refer to hippie or Narrativist indie games.  When Clinton originally proposed using the term (though I'm sure other people have used it before), before SG.com was founded, he meant it to be a blanket term that was LARGER than roleplaying games, describing everything that was going on in gaming, because some folks were caught up in arguing that something "wasn't an RPG" or whatever. It was never intended to be a label for a smaller subset of roleplaying or something different from roleplaying.  And, personally, it's kinda ridiculous and actively exclusionary to consider Agon and D&amp;D to be fundamentally different things. Why do we have to split people into camps? I don't think Apocalypse World is better than Castle Ravenloft. How do you even compare them? They are trying to do completely different things!<br/><br/><b>Marshall:</b> The wiki is what it is.

While there's a lot of baggage around "story," "narrativist," and "indie" labels, its not unreasonable to look at the site and think that they are less loaded than they are and that those are valid descriptors with agreed upon meanings.  Also, the wiki does need some updating and fleshing out.  Maybe we should make a day of it (perhaps once a year) and have everyone pitch in to get it somewhat up to date.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322827/#Comment_322827" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T10:49:58+00:00" title="May  3, 2011 10:49AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reminds me of the way hip hop uses the word "underground" to describe anything smart and good, in spite of Danny Hoch's caveat that "you're not underground if your parents know where you live."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322832/#Comment_322832" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T10:58:03+00:00" title="May  3, 2011 10:58AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2011 11:09AM by Ross_Cowman.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ J.Walton<br/>Its cool.

When many of them hear the term "story game", they think:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Games like Dixit and Once Upon a Time<br/>\n- That forum where people talk about indie games and posters tend to be liberals<br/>\n- Indie / Forge games<br/>\n- Hyper focused RPGs that tell specific stories<br/>\n- Games where you do more than just fight<br/>\n- Any game where you tell a story<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people consider D&amp;D; 4E to be a Story Game but D&amp;D; 3E not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I agree that in games like D&amp;D;, rules as written, the GM isn't the sole person responsible for bringing the fun. But culturally, many people who play D&amp;D; do believe this is true. And at some point, perception effectively becomes reality. I know I've gamed with D&amp;D; players who refused to say anything unless I announce, "roll initiative" and even then limited their input to strict game mechanic choices and looked to me to bring all the energy and excitement to the game. When I asked them what was up, they said it was my job to bring the fun\u2026 which to me was bizarre\u2026 but then I've heard it again and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd often, it's not just people making things up.

But then when you step back, and look at the way the rules are written\u2026 you look at what percentage of the text says "combat" and what percentage says "something else", it's not too difficult to understand where the perception comes from. It's also tied to the game system's rewards, the game examples, the official adventures they release, how so much of the non-combat rules are in the DMG and not the Players Handbook, the length of playing out combat vs other activities, and much more. What you say isn't enough.

But honestly, at this point I'd just settle for "sole" being removed from the sentence.  Or anything that acknowledges that having fun at the vast majority of gaming tables does in fact require players who are actively contributing to that fun.  I have yet to meet a GM who could make a game fun without players who make games fun, nor a GM who would <i>want</i> to.<br/><br/><br/>(Actually, what I'd really like to see is all the people who drag out the "I don't like how the GM is the sole provider of fun" line to say what they really mean:  "the GM usually has to do a lot of things that I personally don't enjoy doing."  No one could argue with that, there are a lot of GM-specific tasks that can be pretty unappealing.

And possibly a good example of perception being stronger than reality. <br/><br/>2 points...<br/><br/>1. No one in this thread (of 30 posts) has stated they agree with the OP. Most of the replies are the opposite. Jonathan even pointed out that there were months where the hot topic on Story Games was playing and enjoying D&amp;D 4E. <br/><br/>2. The OP is also an infrequent contributor to Story Games (that's not meant as any sort of offense Ross). They've visited Story Games 96 times, started 5 discussions, and added 23 comments. Yet they are representative of Story Games? <br/><br/>If you take these 2 points together, it seems there isn't adequate proof to believe that Story Games is unfriendly to people who like games like say D&amp;D. But I think, perception wise, I can totally understand why someone would come up with that conclusion. <br/><br/>I think what happens is... we have many examples of threads like this. Added together, they create a perception in many people (especially when people have already decided their opinion on Story Games and then unconsciously look for information to reinforce that opinion) that feels like fact. <br/><br/>I'm not saying Story Games is problem free. It has many problems, every place does. But for me personally, it brings together some of my favorite people to game with in one place. And when I start threads and ask the community for help with something, I've found the quality of answers to be unmatched.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322930/#Comment_322930" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T16:19:15+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  4:19PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Sure, there's probably something that drives<i>every</i>incorrect perception in this world, but I don't think that's an argument for letting them go uncorrected.</blockquote>\nWhether there are any specific *games* that hold the GM as the "provider of fun" I'm not 100% sure of that assumption.<br/><br/>What I am 100% sure of is that there is definitely a cultural trend within the hobby where that is absolutely the case.  I have been at the table where all of the following has happened.<br/><br/>1) A die roll has gone bad and a player has turned to the GM or resorted to passive-aggressive behavior directed at the GM with the clear expectations that the rules will be fudged or a re-roll allowed or some combination of the two because the player is unhappy with the result and expects the GM to "fix it".<br/><br/>2) A player is uncomfortable with another players' words or actions and turns to the GM expecting him to address it.<br/><br/>3) A player refuses to engage the scenario despite given every opportunity to do so and then blames the GM for the not providing appropriate content.<br/><br/>1 &amp; 3 in combination are particularly insidious because THAT player is unhappy because the GM not only fails to provide specific oportunities but ALSO specific outcomes usually relating to the player's particular character "schtick" or "archetype".<br/><br/>Are these expectations of specific games?  No, probably not (though I have seen published material that promote these habits).

I don't want to be the sole provider of the "fun".<br/><br/>then maybe sometime in the future I'd be into going back to the ideas in the original post.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323055/#Comment_323055" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T09:01:58+00:00" title="May  4, 2011  9:01AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2011 9:04AM by J B Bell.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DeBracy</cite><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>Also, I was secretly hoping that this was going to be a link to a T-shirt I could buy with some clever catchprhase on it.</blockquote>\nI was secretly hoping it would be something relating to LGBT gamers.<br/><br/>How about "Go Play," and that nice icon of the "play" button, with a little list below with check-boxes for:\n<ul>\n<li>Story Games</li>\n<li>With Cock</li>\n<li>With Pussy</li>\n</ul>\nMine would have all three checked, but we could make t-shirts &amp; buttons with various other options.<br/>[Edited to fix busticated html]<br/><br/>I'm sure it will never be interpreted incorrectly. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323076/#Comment_323076" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T10:59:27+00:00" title="May  4, 2011 10:59AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2011 11:52AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans C-O</cite>I have met &amp; talked with Ross face to face, and while I don't know him super well, I can easily say he's an excellent human being and inclusive as all get out.<br/><br/>Just a reminder that the internet isn't the real world, for what it's worth.</blockquote>\nI can appreciate that. We're all better in person.<br/><br/>But man, I've been swimming around the larger pond lately, and it's comments like that that cause the outer community to just plain not care about the games. Not hypothetically. Actual people actually saying "fuck those games" because of the people who are poorly advocating them. This fanbase turns people off of story games. This comment is just one example. The casual browser doesn't know "this dude rarely posts" from "this dude is one of our prolific peeps." All they see is an attack on what they enjoy when you tell them that the thing they're doing is worse, is badwrongfun.<br/><br/>That's a bummer. I'm pointing it out. If you want to be inclusive, talk about how you love something without shitting on other things. Using words like "better" is saying "you're playing something <em>worse</em>." You may not be comfortable with that, but that doesn't make it untrue.<br/><br/>Or, hey, don't change your language. Keep this hobby in the rabid-fandom ghetto. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323098/#Comment_323098" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T12:51:47+00:00" title="May  4, 2011 12:51PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J B Bell</cite>How about "Go Play," and that nice icon of the "play" button</blockquote>\nOR what if the play button had rainbow stripes on it.

Things have evolved significantly since then and even then it's impossible to say what percentage of the hobby actually followed that advice.  We do know that every group put their own touch on how they approached the game.  I suspect that how one views the state of this issue is based entirely on their own historical gaming background and current predilections.  I've been playing pretty much non-storygames with my group now for over 4 years and I can say with confidence that we are all, players and GM, responsible for play, that we have creative equality and that it is a safe space to play (though not always so safe for the PCs <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>).<br/><br/>Certainly, the influence of gamers who are pushing the envelope and trying new things has been strong in our group, but that doesn't mean that these good things are exclusive to gamers in that community.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite><br/>That said, I sure do love story games, or indie games, or whatever we call them.

And there are so many great games too!</blockquote>\nThis happens in every other sub-community of the gaming hobby.  Again, the independent game movement took the tradition of community production and ran with it in a great way, but so did so many other gaming communities.

Not hypothetically. Actual people actually saying "fuck those games" because of the people who are poorly advocating them. This fanbase turns people off of story games. This comment is just one example. The casual browser doesn't know "this dude rarely posts" from "this dude is one of our prolific peeps." All they see is an attack on what they enjoy when you tell them that the thing they're doing is worse, is badwrongfun.<br/><br/>That's a bummer. I'm pointing it out. If you want to be inclusive, talk about how you love something without shitting on other things. Using words like "better" is saying "you're playing something <em>worse</em>." You may not be comfortable with that, but that doesn't make it untrue.</blockquote>Agreed 1000%.<br/><br/>"Here are the things I get out of PtA that I don't get out of D&amp;D," and, "here are the things I get out of D&amp;D that I don't get out of PtA," should be friends in discussion topic land, and they should form a superteam and maul the fuck out of "indie is better than trad".<br/><br/>I'm not gonna claim that shitting on others' fun on the internet is some horrible crime, but man, turning people off from the stuff that you value seems like a bad thing to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323814/#Comment_323814" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T15:40:09+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  3:40PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>When Clinton originally proposed using the term (though I'm sure other people have used it before), before SG.com was founded, he meant it to be a blanket term that was LARGER than roleplaying games, describing everything that was going on in gaming, because some folks were caught up in arguing that something "wasn't an RPG" or whatever. It was never intended to be a label for a smaller subset of roleplaying or something different from roleplaying.</blockquote>\nDamn, man.  I didn't realize that.<br/><br/>Somebody call the Story Games Authorities and see if they can officially reinstate the old meaning of the term, and effect a return to a state of grace and innocence, from this world of sin and darkness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14224/sg-pride" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14224/sg-pride" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14224/sg-pride/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14224%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14224%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
