It seems that Tyler ran afoul of a crime boss on Savinia (a Mr. Hung) and \u201crescued\u201d Seed/Three from another (Mr. Sung).  While Tyler discusses signing onto the Damocles, Kyo Park, one of Mr. Sung\u2019s lieutenants, tries to take Seed/Three from the bar.  A brawl breaks out, but the crew of the Damocles escapes with two new members.<br/><br/>Marcus learns of an archaeological dig nearby that has unearthed a Garudan interface vessel.  The Garuda once controlled this cluster, but they long ago vanished.  He drops everything else and takes the crew (except Ephraim, who guards the Damocles) to visit the dig.  He meets with Dr. Yolanda, the head researcher there, and together they enter the ancient vessel.  Meanwhile, one of the diggers, Aaron, is an ex-con who remembers Timothy from prison.  Aaron ambushes Timothy and prepares to bury him alive in the desert.<br/><br/>Session 002 \u2013 2010-01-18<br/>Planet:  Savinia<br/><br/>Farren blasts Aaron before he can finish off Timothy and proceeds to help Tim get over to the camp.  Meanwhile, Marcus and Yolanda discover the interface vessel is remarkably well preserved.  Marcus manages to reactivate the ship.  Yolanda congratulates him, then knocks him unconscious.<br/><br/>Outside, Seed/Three has accessed the interface vessel\u2019s computer and determines that it is preparing to launch.  Seed/Three informs Farren, Timothy, and Tyler, and they talk their way onto the ship before its seals its hatches.  Seed/Three manages to access the vessel\u2019s autopilot and commands it to dock with the only available Garudan ship, the Damocles.  As they fly up to orbit, the crew manages to subdue Yolanda.<br/><br/>In orbit, the Damocles automatically shifts orbit to pick up the interface vessel, much to Ephraim\u2019s consternation.  He tries and fails to alter the ship\u2019s course.  A Mithran frigate, the Gladius, hails the Damocles.  Captain Quintus Phelps demands the Damocles return to its normal orbit.  <br/><br/>Fortunately, Ephraim knows of a few skeletons in Captain Phelps\u2019s closet, so they broker a deal where no criminal charges are pressed against the Damocles and they hand Yolanda over to Phelps.  Yolanda tries to bargain for her freedom, claiming to know where a large cache of Garudan artifacts is located, but the crew rejects her offer.  Marcus arranges to buy the interface vessel, though it leaves him rather strapped for cash.<br/><br/>Marcus needs some quick money, so he and Ephraim decide to run a \u201chigh-risk, high-reward\u201d cargo from Savinia to Talamar.  It\u2019s a long journey, and a potentially dangerous one, as they will have to travel through Quand space.  <br/><br/>The trip takes approximately 1 month, and two Quandian pirates attack them as they travel through the Quand System.  The Damocles outruns one and uses its electronic warfare suite to cripple the other.  Marcus demands tribute from the pirates.  They tell him to go to hell, and Tyler destroys their helpless ship with all hands on board.  Consequently, Tyler is wanted in Quand for \u201cwar crimes.\u201d<br/><br/>Session 003 \u2013 2010-02-01<br/>Planet:  Talamar<br/><br/>Low on reaction mass, the Damocles arrives at the Talamar slipknot station.  Three handles the initial bureaucratic entanglements, either producing or forging the proper forms to get them a berth.  After that, however, things begin to go wrong.<br/><br/>Slowly, the crew discovers that the station\u2019s Portmaster. Mandla Kwanele, is corrupt and will only let ships leave after they pay some hefty \u201cfees.\u201d  Since he is already strapped for cash, this is not welcome news for Marcus.  To make matters worse, Ephraim\u2019s contact at the station, Dingane Gugu, has been arrested for smuggling technology to Quand.<br/><br/>While Marcus and Ephraim discuss what to do, Timothy, Farren, and Tyler go out to enjoy the sights of the Talamar slipknot station.  Seed/Three decides to stay on the Damocles, as a search of station residents reveals that his aunt, Hippolyta Griggs, is a senior vice-president of the Tarterus Corporation on station.<br/><br/>Tyler does badly in a high-stakes poker game but learns that there are Quandian refugees in quarantine on the station, suffering from some horrible disease.  Tyler sneaks into the quarantine section, only to learn that the \u201cillness\u201d is something far worse.  The refugees are being used as \u201cmules\u201d to transport Garudan technology inside their bodies.  But now their bodies are rejecting the tech and they are dying.  Tyler is then discovered by a station doctor.<br/><br/>Farren wants to enjoy a quiet drink, but a woman approaches him and asks for his help in freeing her boyfriend, whom the Portmaster has wrongfully arrested.  She turns out to be Cassandra Stark, Marcus\u2019s sister, and her boyfriend is Jedadiah X, a Quandian freedom fighter who runs an \u201cunderground railroad\u201d to get men out of Quand\u2019s repressive matriarchy.  Cassandra gets technology from the Hespera Corporation, the family business, and uses it to bribe Quandian officials to look the other way as Jedadiah X smuggles the men out.  Years ago, Jedadiah X helped Ephraim escape from Quand.  <br/><br/>Now, however, the Portmaster has taken her money, arrested Jedadiah, and quarantined their most recent crop of \u201crefugees.\u201d  She tells Farren that the Portmaster wants her necklace, a piece of broken Garudan technology that her brother gave her as a good luck charm.  Farren takes Cassandra back to the Damocles, where Marcus is very upset to learn that she has been selling family secrets, including technology of his own design, to the Quandians.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Timothy finds an old shipmate in the bar and they proceed to get plastered.  He wakes up later to find himself in a snakeweed den.  Snakeweed is an outlawed drug from Eden, and his \u201cfriend,\u201d Jefferson Hope, has pictures of him apparently passing out snakeweed to other people.  Jefferson explains that he fell in with a bad crowd, and that they want Timothy to let him on board the Damocles so he can inspect the memory core of the Garudan interface vessel.  Timothy reluctantly agrees.<br/><br/>Timothy sneaks Jefferson aboard the Damocles, but Seed/Three notices them.  They talk their way past him, but when Jefferson tries to hook his data copying device into the interface vessel, it instead unleashes a virus.  Seed/Three contains the virus, and the rest of the crew run down to catch the intruder.  Ephraim captures Jefferson, who tries to pin the blame on Timothy.  At a loss for what to do next, they lock Jefferson up.  <br/><br/>Slowly, the crew uncovers a pattern, thanks to Seed/Three poking around the computer nets.  It seems that the Portmaster, the Tarterus Corporation, and an unknown organization are heavily involved in smuggling Garudan tech.  They are using the Quandian freedom movement as a cover in some cases, and a bewildering number of false vessel IDs and fake cargoes.  Seed also determines that Jefferson is part of the ring.<br/><br/>Now they have to figure out what to do next, and how to get their ship away from the station without paying exorbitant fees.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256486/#Comment_256486" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-13T09:08:56+00:00" title="February 13, 2010  9:08AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting stuff.

We do try to make our descriptions of the alien tech as strange as possible.  I didn't want to make things too complicated, and I'd rather deal with the character and story ramifications of alien tech.  <br/><br/>The alien tech showed up during the Cluster Creation from a suggestion from one of the players, and it's become something of a theme for the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
