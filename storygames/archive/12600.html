We stumble on the same stones over and over again. One example is economic collapse from pyramid-scheme-like bubbles (from tulips to dot-com-crashes). Another, which I hate, is how we so often believe our leaders when they tell us that THIS time, the war is Just, and will Make Things Better. I mean, the last one turned out to be based on lies, and made things worse; the one before that was the same; why do we think things will change this time? <br/><br/>I'm thinking that a game with a specific system, designed to showcase some of the dynamics and motivations (emotional, political, economical) involved, might help us see how it all fits together - and, possibly, how to change things. <br/><br/>What do you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282857/#Comment_282857" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T04:02:36+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  4:02AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you begin by defining stupidity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282858/#Comment_282858" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T04:06:29+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  4:06AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's probably easier to start with writing a game to demonstrate cognitive biases or probability because that's already in the field of game theory.<br/><br/>(Pocket design: Everyone is dealt 8 playing cards.

I think a roleplaying game, at its core, is a very engaging way to deliver information. The interesting thing, for me, is that the delivery is framed experientially, so you not only learn about the Norman Conquest, but have some memories and emotions attached to it, which makes that learning sticky and relevant. This is predicated on a certain degree of trust in your audience, of course, to recognize the difference between the narrative they created and the reality upon which it was built.<br/><br/>This doesn't directly answer your question, but I think it is an important signpost. History is easy, raw data is easy. It is used as I describe <a href="http://www.barnard.edu/reacting/" rel="nofollow">in an academic context</a> without destroying anyone's mind.

Someone doesn't need to be a psychologist or anthropologist to have an opinion on human nature...it could just as easily be argued that excessive knowledge in this field provides a marvelous theoretical structure at the expense of instinctive insight (which is often trained out of an academic...I've read dozens of books explaining this phenomenon). </i><br/><br/>With these two points in mind, I totally believe that gaming can be used to teach moral lessons in a "safe" environment. <br/><br/>I think the real question here is whether you let the questions evolve through the fruitful void, or whether you address them directly through rule mechanisms. The first option needs some kind of prompts to pose the right questions, while these prompts could probably be considered excessive and heavy-handed in a game where the issue is mechanically addressed. <br/><br/>On the other hand, how many self-help gurus (with or without training) are destroying the world with their own brand of stupidity.

There's a number of interesting coincidences he cites in the writing of the thing: how, for example, when he had the main character brutually tortured and conned into believing he had some horrible flesh disease, he actually came down with a fairly nasty sickness, and when said main character, later, hooked up with the hot redheaded main character, he himself found a hot redheaded girlfriend as well, if I recall correctly. (No mention on whether or not said RL girlfriend was a psychic cyborg from the future.)<br/><br/>Now, I'm more than moderately skeptical as to the claims of self-determined practitioners of magic, but the <i>idea</i> I always found fascinating: if you could design a graphic novel as a magical spell, why not an RPG? I mean, you're not just making an entire world, there, but rules for how it works and how things interact with eachother. I'm pretty sure that's some strong mojo potential in a lot of people's books.<br/><br/>Plus, to be brutally honest, I think you're more likely to get magic to work than you would be to get the required target audience to play an RPG that's relatively more straightforwardly world-changing-by-being-subversively-educational. I mean, regardless of political affiliation, most RPG-players are already at least moderately talent at critical thinking, yeah? You might have better luck with a board game, something like Risk where you needed to use various tactics, underhanded or otherwise, to win public support before you could go to war (especially after any costly losses on an aggressive action) but could get campaign funding by pursuing certain corporate interests. Or something like that.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you could make an RPG that doesn't teaching people critical thinking, so much as teaching people how to teach <i>others</i> about critical thinking. A game with a "You can't win alone" theme, basically, fighting against two fronts: your enemies, and public indifference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Dogs in the Vineyard is a thought experiment about violence and authority, right? It does that by having a system whereby shooting people can get you what you want, and the system tells you the consequences of the violence you used. It's also a thoughtful critique of theocracy.</p>\n<p>We've tried to play out two campaigns of Mechaton. In both, we used a system of stakes, competing over several battles to see if we'll get the things we want. Of course, since battle is the only way to accomplish things in Mechaton, we made factions that would try to accomplish these things through battle. Neither campaign ever finished for two reasons: one is mechanical (and technical and not relevant here) and the other is that we were disgusted with the premise. We had the good things laid out that we wanted to happen, but the idea that we could only accomplish these things by killing people diluted any possible fictional gain we could make. It's fun to try to win a battle. It's less fun to look at the battle as a cost for accomplishing good in the world.</p>\n<p>So, that's a challenge: making sure that not only are you addressing the themes, but that you're doing it in a way that's compelling enough to keep doing it. If it's making you say something you don't want to say, it's going to be hard to stay engaged.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282882/#Comment_282882" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T06:49:02+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  6:49AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>How do we transfer this knowledge to real-life understanding?</blockquote>\nOne cherished tradition is to trick people into roles they would otherwise find abhorrent, then pull back the curtain.

If you just present a toy model (in the sense of a thing to play with and see what happens) what you won't be getting across are the critical skills needed to 1) discern the dynamics and structures in the real world systems similar to this model and 2) execute the desired types of changes. Teaching skills often works better from the bottom up, where the last thing you want to do is worry about a moment of revelatory knowledge, rather you want to reward active competency in overcoming increasingly difficult tasks, sufficiently constrained to ensure that you are teaching the skills you want, and not a warped variation of them. <br/><br/>Intentional teaching through play is very complex, often because of all the clever ways that your "student" tries to undermine your goal. That being said, it is a rare game which doesn't impart something to the player - the question is to find out what it might be for a particular player, and build from there. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282902/#Comment_282902" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T08:26:23+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  8:26AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs:<br/><br/>I dunno about teaching by way of games, but I can say that lots of Little Wars helped me to become solidly unenthusiastic about Big Wars, as HG Wells would say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

He's just 19 days old at the moment, but I'm really excited to one day play roleplaying games and deal with a lot of issues in imaginary worlds that would be difficult in real life, for a kid at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking I want to start out with basic questions first; things like, "why do good people do bad things?" or "how should you judge who you can trust and who you can't, when you've only just met them?" Of course, those are deep questions in a way, but they're really relevant to a child, I think, when they reach the point that they have to start confronting the first complexities of human relationships. I plan to teach him by letting him explore relationships with characters in an imaginary environment. Dealing with the issue of trust, for instance, I'll probably just let his character encounter a number of individuals who seem one way at first, but then turn out to be something else, all along dropping clues that he might not pick up on at first, only realizing in hindsight after he's made a mistake. I hope his imaginary character's mistakes can translate into more success in real life, without having to go through as much real life mistakes in the process. I know, of course, that you can't avoid real life mistakes no matter what you do, but I hope imaginary mistakes can at least help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, even teaching that is going to be tricky, and I'm bound to make a lot of mistakes myself in the process. If you think about something like teaching societies how not to repeat the mistakes of history -- there's actually a huge system of interrelated attitudes, spiritual qualities, concepts, and skills wrapped up in a capability that seems like it should be so simple, even for a single individual, much less a whole society.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut let's start with an individual, playing our hypothetical game, with the hope of learning something from it -- say, how to tell the difference between a just war and an unjust one (and to consider, is there such thing as a just war to begin with?). First, he'd have to have an attitude of openness to even be willing to consider the question. Second, he'd have to have the spiritual quality of tolerance and open-mindedness to even be willing to consider listening to you or your game about the issue in addition to whatever other source of information he might feel is more authoritative, or at least more familiar. Third, he'd need the concept that everything, even war, functions according to certain principles, and if we can find out what those principles are, we can understand the underlying causes of what otherwise might seem to be incomprehensible outcomes. Finally, he would need the skill of trying things out, seeing what happens, identifying principles involved, and then applying that experience and learning to the next encounter, whether it is another in-game encounter, or an encounter in real life. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd those are all the things he'd need just to begin learning about justice and war in a roleplaying game -- but still it would be a beginning. Breaking down complex questions into manageable bits this way might be helpful in identifying elements that need to be there in the game, as well as the sort of language and presentation that the game needs to be written in. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might not be a good idea to say, "the purpose of this game is to teach you how not to be stupid" or even necessarily, "this game is about just and unjust war." It might be better to set up two sides locked in a conflict of some sort, and make each one approachable, so that you con understand how each side views itself as the good guys, and yet at the same time show how each one has flaws and shortcomings to deal with. Playing the game will force players to ask, "am I doing the right thing? Should I really be charging into this battle?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're looking for inspiration in fiction, a couple of good sources come to mind. The first is the Indian classic, "Mahabharata" in which a major theme is the question of justice in war. The famed "Bhagavad Gita" of Hinduism is set at the climax of this epic story, in which one of the main characters, Arjun, heads out in his chariot to the battlefield and realizes that his own relatives are standing there in the opposite army. He wonders aloud, "how can I possibly go into battle and kill my own family members?" Arjun's charioteer happens to be Krishna, whose answer to that question has driven countless minds to great learning over the ages. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother more modern inspiration is an awesome novel I'm reading now called "The Sacrifice" by Kristine Kathryn Rusch. In it, there are protagonists from both sides of a war, and it really delves into issues of truth, faith, morality, and justice, all without ever sounding preachy or condescending. Its characters face real problems and struggle with the answers in their own way just like you and I do, and what lesson you want to draw from all that is totally up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the key things to take away from all this is that you can set up a situation in which all the themes you want to deal with are present, frame the rules in such a way that the players must confront those themes, and then let them loose and see what they learn from it. Whatever learning they do has to be their own if it's going to stick; it has to come because of their own choices, mistakes, and victories -- but that's exactly where RPGs are strong. You can't *make* someone learn, but you can give them all the tools they need to do so, and a good roleplaying game can give us that chance to explore a meaningful story world on our own terms, make choices, and consider the consequences those choices bring us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282907/#Comment_282907" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T08:46:18+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  8:46AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>The next question, though, which I find much harder: How do we transfer this knowledge to real-life understanding?

For instance, if I had known a little about Dogs in the Vineyard before I played it, I probably would have been very hesitant about playing it.  I would have thought: this sounds like a religion-bashing game and I'm not interested in playing a game like that (even if I don't completely disagree).<br/><br/>Having a goal of indoctrinating others into your belief is going to run into problems like that.  A game that presupposes that recent wars were unjust and made things worse won't reach someone on the "other side".  But a game that shows that wars could be unjust and make things worse can have the intended effect of inoculating against stupidity.<br/><br/>Presenting ideas, concepts, and perhaps perspectives seem accomplishable.  Points of reference:<br/><br/>Chained Souls, an RPG I designed, is about Christians trying to free themselves of their slavery to the world and things in it through spiritual pursuits.  It's a statement that the Christian life isn't just getting up early on Sunday to listen to someone talk.<br/><br/>Power Grid, a board game where you compete to provide electric power to the most cities.  In this game I've noticed that while green power plants are nice (you don't have to buy fuel), they are expensive and don't often let you power enough cities to win the game.

Trying to use RPGs to teach "about" topics seems likely to turn into a bad game.  Probably much better to use game situations to raise questions and start discussion rather than having a parable lesson that the players are supposed to learn.  At least, I expect the former to be a lot more fun than the later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283393/#Comment_283393" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T17:26:09+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  5:26PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2010 5:27PM by mease19.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that trying to teach a lesson is sort of like telling a joke.  The lesson is the punchline - you play for a while and then at the end you learn your lesson.  So, the question is how to design a game that teaches the lesson.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne way might be to have a mechanical ending - the game will always ends a certain way - to force the lesson.  For example, an RPG about the Salem witch trials could always end with the players being hung - the game would then be about how you got there, thus forcing players to consider root causes of a defined outcome.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, when teaching it is often best to tell, then show.  You could start by teaching the lesson and then use the game to show how situations do or do not result from those causes.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, another way might be to start with psychological/historic catalysts and then play out the fallout from that catalyst.  For example, a game about "the problem with yes-men" might always start with an invitation to the queens court but then use mechanical rewards for parroting the queen and and groupthink while punishing originality by making you play a game of chance with the odds against you (playing against the house as it were) - small chance of a big pay-off, large chance of embarrassment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
