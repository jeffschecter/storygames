There are some people who are put off by the idea that a game is indie, and there are some people that are drawn to it. I'm not sure how that balances out in the end, but while Evil Hat is probably making more money than the vast majority of indie publishers, they've said that even with Dresden Files' fantastic success they're not making enough to live off of or anything.<br><br>The flip side of this, I suppose, is that a lot of what we're likely to consider qualifying factors for the "indie" label probably become harder and harder to maintain as a game pulls in bigger numbers. A certain point practical concerns must prevent you from being a one-man operation, to be sure.<br><br>But on the whole I just want more neat games to keep coming out.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294612/#Comment_294612" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-25T20:42:22+00:00" title="September 25, 2010  8:42PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>the Evil Hat guys have largely avoided identifying themselves as being in or out of the indie RPG scene and just done their thing.<br/></blockquote>\n"JDC has largely avoided saying he makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches when he spreads ultra-crunchy peanut butter and homemade grape jelly on two slices of whole wheat bread, so trying to identify what he's making as 'peanut butter and jelly sandwiches' is kind of an odd test case."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294613/#Comment_294613" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-25T20:42:45+00:00" title="September 25, 2010  8:42PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            forget my labels your welcome you have your own. <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/><br/>\n<br/>\nspirit of the century has always been on the indie shelf at every store i visit and has been a big part of the indie "brand" success here in portland.<br/>\n<br/>\nthis is about inclusion &amp; exclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nwill you accept games and companies growing or will you not?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294616/#Comment_294616" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-25T21:59:39+00:00" title="September 25, 2010  9:59PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>will you accept games and companies growing or will you not?</blockquote>Sure.

That's not the best way to start a conversation, especially on a topic as contentious as "what does 'indie' mean" has become.<br><br>Some of the background is like this (and I only know a piece of it):<br><br>The definition of "indie" used by the Forge -- from which SG and large portion of this particular indie scene descends (though not the Evil Hat guys, directly, though they use IPR and have some significant crossover) -- was based around creator ownership, period.  There's some complex baggage that goes along with that statement, like the tradition of paying dirt-cheap prices for art because you're only licensing the publication rights from artists (when they may or may not be interested in any of the rights) and the Forge giving rise to a series of autuer-style self-publishers, such that models where multiple creators were involved were only sometimes experimented with (Universalis, etc.)... but that's the simple version: creator ownership.<br><br>Currently, different members of the indie community feel more or less strongly about creator ownership being the key thing that unites us.  Ben and Joshua are probably among the most vocal, hardcore advocates of creator ownership being the most important thing.  If you ask other folks, you'll get some more wishy-washy answers that are much more flexible regarding what the point of the community is.<br><br>Evil Hat had been doing Fate on their own, as a Fudge hack, and had a big internet following before they ever did Spirit of the Century.  They had some connections to the post-Forge or pan-Forge community and published SOTC using a similar model and distributed it through IPR and then Fred got closedly involved in the IPR/Forge/Adept Press booth at GenCon and eventually started doing some work for IPR.  So Evil Hat went from being kinda doing their own thing to being at the heart of this particular indie community, at least in terms of publishing (I keep qualifying that because there are other indie publishers who have little or no connection with this scene).  A lot of us liked SOTC a lot, so this was cool.  But there were also a bunch of discussions, which drove Fred nuts, about whether SOTC was indie, etc. etc.  And there was some other resentment about other stuff, including the direction that IPR was going (which may not have had anything to do with Evil Hat), so... as things stand now, Evil Hat -- as far as I can tell -- doesn't go out of the way to call themselves indie or try to claim that label.  Plus, with licensing Dresden, you clearly have a not-indie game, though nobody gives Luke any shit about Burning Empires or Mouse Guard (and Luke says that Mouse Guard isn't indie), so there's totally a double standard going on there, but that's a whole separate issue.<br><br>As far as I can tell, the weird feelings about SOTC and Evil Hat are mostly not about their runaway success or their attempt to appeal to mainstream gamers.  Those are things that most indie publishers aspire to, Matt Snyder's opinions notwithstanding.  Luke certainly has runaway success and aims for a mainstream gamer audience.  Same with Vincent, at least for most of his games.  There's a bunch of other weird thorny stuff that's behind the whole "SOTC/Evil Hat isn't indie anymore/ever" meme that's been going around.  I was just talking to Ryan Macklin about it when he was visiting and he had a couple of insights, but I'm still not sure what the whole story is.  I would like to track down what the truth of the matter is and get the involved parties to sit down and talk to each other, because, honestly, it's kinda dumb and counterproductive for all of us.  But I don't know how to make that happen at this point.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294618/#Comment_294618" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-25T22:10:38+00:00" title="September 25, 2010 10:10PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2010 10:16PM by TylerT.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/noclue">@noclue</a><br/>\nhigh five<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/J">@J</a>.

The term is also understood to imply certain design aesthetics and philosophies within this community, which is why it's often used as shorthand, but those qualities are not actually part of the definition I use. A game made off the OGL by a small press, creator owned and managed company is indie, even if it doesn't possess the design aesthetics and philosophies implied by the term.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Burning Wheel is indie, because it's creator owned and managed. Mouse Guard is not because it's owned and (presumably) managed by someone other than the game's creator. It has the same design philosophies and aesthetics (at least some of them) as BW, but that's not part of the definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nHence the reason why indie is generally considered to be a useless term, because no one really knows what you mean by it until you define it, in which case, it's generally easier just to spell out the definition you're using. That said, I still use it as shorthand when talking to gamers who aren't into the indie/small press/story-game community. When I use it there, I'm specifically using it as "Not WOTC, White Wolf, etc." It's easier when you're talking in generalities. Occasionally, I'll use the term small press instead. I basically never use the term story-game, unless I'm referring to this site/community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294626/#Comment_294626" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T02:40:33+00:00" title="September 26, 2010  2:40AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Yay, more knowledge about how Vincent thinks.  And that makes some of the other things you've said clearer.<br/><br/>I kind of have a different horse in this race, partially because of talking with my brother about the situation in indie comics, since he works for Top Shelf.  Honestly, I suspect that indie games will eventually move more in that direction, away from self-publication as the main model and more towards "indie publishing houses" where folks license limited publications rights for X period of time to folks who are primarily publishers and not designers (or both, like Brennan and Fred).  Indie comics has been working on that model for a long time and the big shakeup there recently has been mainstream book publishers like Random House <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_Books" rel="nofollow">starting their own comics imprints</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_%28comics%29#Color_editions" rel="nofollow">signing up important creators</a>, a problem that we don't quite have but definitely could in 10 or 20 or 30 years.  Can you imagine WOTC starting their own small press imprint, once RPGs start being licensed for video games or movies?  So I guess I'm more interested in how we preserve creator rights going forward, rather than focusing on the self-publication model that has predominated so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294654/#Comment_294654" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T10:46:03+00:00" title="September 26, 2010 10:46AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>I can only speak for myself, but I show up in certain indie circles because I consume, enjoy, play, and run the games that I'm exposed to through that participation, and I enjoy talking about that with other people.</blockquote>\nYeah, I mean, if discussing this stuff is limited to designers, then how did I get in the door, I don't design things, my job is yelling really loud.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294655/#Comment_294655" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T11:02:31+00:00" title="September 26, 2010 11:02AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a bummer "indie" can't mean "folks who just love doing what they're doing and doing it on their terms."<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Playing is an act that requires collaboration.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have enjoyed indie works like cave story immensely, but i also really like Pixar movies and some Hasbro board games are absolutely great. oh valve is also doing some stuff that i love!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter experiencing a little of the "Getting published" process and a whole lot of the "trying to get published" process I think "publishing my own damn self" process is the best for me.

If Thor does editorial work on Burning Wheel products, that's not separable from the product and it does him no good to "own" the editorial work on it, yeah?  Likewise, if somebody does art for one of my games and has no real means of selling prints to my customers -- but I do -- then it probably makes more sense to pay the artist more for complete rights to the artwork -- so I can sell the prints myself, when the artist can't -- rather than let the artist keep rights they can't use, yeah?<br><br>And, in parallel, I guess, if I have a game that I'm not in a good position to publish myself (because of the time and energy involved, or whatever other reasons)... having the rights to it doesn't do me any good, no matter what good I could potentially get from them.  You see where I'm going with this?  Self-publication isn't a model that works for everyone, because having rights to something and being able to leverage those rights are two different things.  Presumably, Drew had the rights to the paintings he made of Star Wars characters, but not the rights to those characters that he would need to make prints (likely, Sony wasn't able to give him those rights, which were probably restricted by their license with Lucas Arts), so having the rights to his artwork did him no good, yeah?<br><br>Basically, I would suggest that the focus on creator ownership and self-publication is great, but that sometimes it gets in the way of people being able to do what they want to (or need to) with the rights they have, as Ryan was trying to allude to earlier in the thread.  Part of the good that comes from having rights -- to anything, including the folks trying to get land rights for poor farmers, to throw in something out of left field -- is being able to use those rights in a variety of ways, including selling them or licensing them to others.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294689/#Comment_294689" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T19:17:29+00:00" title="September 26, 2010  7:17PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent,<br/>\n<br/>\nYour definition strikes me a little off, as well.

Since well before Jared's Indie Game Design Company Challenge, I've thought that the every-man-is-an-island approach to indie and small press publishing is a bummer. I'm not necessarily pushing for companies like Evil Hat or IPR or such as those either, though. What I'm thinking is more like the Collective Endeavor thing, but instead of Collective Endeavor being an umbrella for several different companies/labels/imprints/whatever, that it BECOMES the imprint. As a result of my thoughts on this, shortly after the aforementioned IGDC, I approached a new designer to the community and asked him if he wanted to join my company. Now, it's somewhat laughable that I'm expanding my company when I don't even consider it a success by my own standards. But I figure if I'm going to ever get this idea going for myself, of one company, several designers but each still maintaining full rights to their own work, I might as well start now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know others are doing the same thing. I know it's not a new idea. I just think there's way less of it than there ought to be. The goal, for me, is that eventually there are a few designers all publishing their own games under the Wolves Den Publishing label. They collaborate on each other's projects, they encourage, make suggestions and critically review each other, but their work, even though it all has WDP on the spine, is still theirs. So it's still independent, but it's no longer quite so individual.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294702/#Comment_294702" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T21:50:50+00:00" title="September 26, 2010  9:50PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Should Vincent feel responsible for the irreparable harm that his casually tossed-off words are doing, not only to the indie community and the industry at large, but possibly to life on Earth as we currently know it?

I've nearly given up on "less" vs "fewer." I think indie has gone the same way.<br><br>I've always used the term COP (or COP model) for creator owned publisher to differentiate it from the many definitions of indie. It circumvents semantic arguments.<br/><br/>Writers I work with get paid according to their wishes, commensurate with my ability to pay them. Some people want a percentage of net margin; others a fixed word rate. Some want complete control over the appearance of their work. Others really aren't interested.<br/><br/>Generally, though, I tell people who approach me about getting their game published to publish themselves, and tell them how. There is no moral element to this. The only question is - are people being rewarded for their work? Are they getting a reward commensurate with the risk they take?

I know how they can... I just don't know how they are. And I don't mean the edge cases. How are they on the average?<br/><br/>I have many friends who freelance for RPG publishers. They make about as much money as they would if they self published the same content and sold around 300-500 copies themselves. Although freelancing has given them easily 10 times more exposure which gives them more opportunities moving forward. <br/><br/>But if they were able to sell more than 500 copies on their own without doing much more work than what they were being paid to do as a freelancer, freelancing becomes less profitable. Usually you do have to do a lot more work and possibly work that isn't fun, so for some people they would have to sell closer to 1,000 copies before self publishing became worth it (assuming publishers would alternatively pay them a decently for equivalent work). For some people, they need to freelance first (or give products or services away for free) before they can start selling 1,000 copies on their own. And the average Paizo freelancer I know sells much less when they self publish. <br/><br/>Ways I believe creators can be exploited:<br/>- low pay<br/>- late or no pay<br/>- no royalty options on work that is virtually guaranteed to sell well specifically because of your contributions<br/>- non-competition agreements when pay isn't enough to live on<br/>- full time work without full time benefits<br/>- not paying for creation of Intellectual Property<br/>- undefined contract terms (example: scalable expenses that deduct pay with no limit or proof needed)<br/>- creators pay for expenses up front and are / may be reimbursed later<br/>- publisher gains rights over content they haven't paid for<br/>- publisher limits creators rights without paying for that privilege (example: you can't include your work in your portfolio or sell original artwork)<br/>- no credit<br/>- and I'm sure much more!<br/><br/>Although you could argue that it isn't exploitation if all these details are upfront, clearly understood, the creator doesn't need the work to survive and is ok with these terms. <br/><br/>Also, creators that can sell 1,000+ copies on their own need publishers less but are also in a position of power to negotiate the terms of their publishing contracts. A lot of this come down to leverage. If your work sell poorly on its own, then freelancing may be a huge benefit. But if your work sells well on its own, you can self publish or negotiate to make freelancing worth it. <br/><br/>It all comes down to the details. I know no one is saying publishers, middlemen, and/or self publishing is automatically good or bad... It really just depends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294738/#Comment_294738" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T07:04:23+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  7:04AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Among the maybe a dozen games they had were both of the Dresden Files books, which are Evil Hat/FATE.<br/>That's about where the border between indie and mainstream (for lack of a better word,) is for me: Do they sell it in Borders/B&amp;N?<br/>Since the discussion was about mechanics in indie RPGs, and Dresden Files has the mechanics I was talking about, I could see someone saying they were "mainstream" mechanics.<br/><br/>It seems like a random smattering of Steve Jackson's GURPS supplements (ones where he's the primary author) fit into the definitions of indie I'm hearing here.  AFAIK, SJG is still self-owned, self published.  Sure, he works with other writers, but if collaboration were enough to make you not-indie, half the indie games (including Evil Hat) are gone.  It seems to me like a definition of indie where GURPS Magic 4th edition is indie has some explaining to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294776/#Comment_294776" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T12:19:53+00:00" title="September 27, 2010 12:19PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, too, find it ironic that GURPS is indie and FUDGE (for instance) is not.  But if we stick with the definition involving creators controlling the publishing, well, Steve Jackson is *the* shareholder in Steve Jackson Games, and he gets to make all those decisions.<br/><br/>The part of the definition that bothers me is the one Tyler called out:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>Indie also means something that has an unquantifiable quality of hipster creed</blockquote>\nSure, that's not a very widely acknowledged part of the description, and several people in this thread have explicitly criticized it.  But when someone suggests that Spirit of the Century is not indie because it's being sold in (gasp!) mainstream chain bookstores (as an example: I don't think anyone is claiming that), that's the part of the definition they're invoking.  Or when something loses its indie glow once it's sold 3000 copies.<br/><br/>I like indie games because they tend to be a purer expression of the creator's intent than mainstream games.  I mean, I'm watching the discussion about D&amp;D4 Essentials, and one of the recurring themes is that the people who rewrote D&amp;D4 were targeting it to a certain audience, and the D&amp;D Essentials re-packaging is about targeting a different audience.  But I don't want someone to write a game to target me as part of a certain demographic, because that approach tends to produce calculated, bloodless games.  I want someone to write a game just the way he or she wants it, and then I can love it or hate it just as it is, and not have the intermediary of the marketing department and publisher.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294777/#Comment_294777" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T12:29:54+00:00" title="September 27, 2010 12:29PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure that Steve Jackson Games buys designers' work for publication <i>like crazy</i>.

But we're talking about the creator controlling the publishing, right?  <br/><br/>So Steve Jackson writes the bulk of GURPS core rules, then pays people to advise, consult, edit.  He controls the final draft; he controls what gets published on what schedule.  How does this *not* count as indie?  (I'm not talking about supplements here, I'm talking about the core rules.)  Is it because other people contributed work to it, and they're not co-owners/co-publishers?  Well, any game that says "Thanks to John Doe, who suggested the final version of the task escalation rules" may not be indie either, then.  <br/><br/>And hey, the author-publisher of Shock: has admitted that there's work in the published version that he doesn't own.  Does that make Shock: not indie?  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cy</cite>I'll happily claim that.  For me, indie means not mainstream.  There's certainly a grey area in there.<br/>Being in a mainstream chain bookstore is a prime signifier that something is mainstream.</blockquote>\nBut then it's not a quality of the game any more -- it's a quality of the response to it.  I mean, by your definition, Polaris is indie right now, because most people in the RPG world haven't heard of it.  Suppose something happens - it's used in a movie, say, the way AD&amp;D was used in E.T., and suddenly people are curious about it and buying it.  So with your definition, it's possible for a game to stop being indie and start being mainstream based on factors that have nothing whatsoever to do with the game.  This strikes me as not terribly useful.  Beyond that, I'm not interested in those particular games because they're obscure and not widely known; I'm interested in them because they don't have a publisher separate from the creator controlling the process to produce something the publisher thinks will sell.<br/><br/>(Further, there's a perfectly good word that covers that territory: "obscure."

Both exist within RPG publishing, so these aren't hypothetical extremes.  <br/><br/>The questions is where do you draw the line?  <br/><br/>I think the label "indie" is important because 100% not-creator-controlled work exists, and is even pretty common in RPGs.  For decades, game awards would often be given to the company that published and never mention the author/designer.  My line is that A Penny For My Thoughts should be considered indie.  I'm not completely certain how the licensing details should be split, but I don't think that publishing in cooperation with someone else should automatically be considered non-indie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294806/#Comment_294806" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T14:10:04+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  2:10PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent, I'm still a bit confused.

If you want to have a precise, clear meaning, don't use slang.  If what you mean is "independently produced" and ONLY that, just say "independently produced."

And frankly I doubt that would happen because we, like, talk out what the situation is (we have plenty in inventory already, we should wait a couple weeks to get a better price, demand has really slacked off, or whatever).<br/><br/>So, a partnership or collaboration, is how I see it.<br/><br/>Also, the only times I've ever really called myself "indie" is when making a joke about my various games: "Too indie for the mainstream, too mainstream for the indie."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294936/#Comment_294936" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T10:44:31+00:00" title="September 28, 2010 10:44AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2010 10:44AM by iago.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Wolfe: My supposition is that Chad licenses Evil Hat the right to publish, without his oversight, for a certain period of time or - more likely - a certain number of books, after which they renegotiate.</blockquote>\nThat's definitely a supposition. An incorrect one.<br/><br/>The way we've positioned it with Chad, Chad fully and wholly owns what he created, and we've been *hired* by Chad to provide him with publication services -- basically "we do what you don't want to do, nothing more". I haven't made a single significant decision about S7S that didn't involve Chad giving it the OK.<br/><br/>There are people out there who want to create but don't want to go through the business hassles of self-publication. They don't want to stay on top of keeping a book in print, for example, or feel like they need to get out there and get their creation represented in stores, at conventions, whatever. I think it is bald-faced elitism to adjust one's definition of an already-fraught term in order to exclude those people, especially when arrangements are made to give them all the control they *want* to have over their creations. Publication is just the last mile of a very long road; do the other 99 miles just not count? Sure feels like that's the assertion going on.<br/><br/>Of course, when "indie" got co-opted for RPG publication, it got co-opted (from comics, from movies) in a way that didn't match up with the source. Ryan's definition of indie up top (which he's been instructed by the "in" crowd to come up with another label besides the one that the crowd has already lost control of), is a lot closer to how indie manifests in those industries, and it's no shock to me that the market (the folks actually in control of the label at this point) has tended to view indie as meaning something more along Ryan's lines than the always-obfuscated-but-actually-what-was-meant creator-owned idea. <br/><br/>Seriously, why not just use a self-evident term like creator-owned? -- ooops, I mean, creator-published (that's a new one). I guess that's the real value of "indie" -- the self-appointed arbiters of its meaning can redefine it on the fly to cut out the folks they wanna cut out that day.  And that right there is where I get sad and mad. I've long run a defense against folks claiming elitism is happening here, claiming there's exclusionary, high-school-style politics going on, but man, it has REALLY started to look that way. It's a sad day when those detractors end up turning out as being right, because I really do not find myself liking them very much. I mean, I've gotten plenty of chances to see how fun and cool and warm the folks in this community can be -- IN PERSON. I am a lot happier when I believe that how folks have been in person are how they actually are, and would rejoice at the absence of evidence to the contrary. Which is why I've found that putting some distance between myself and the community only ends up strengthening my ability to feel positive about it. When I actually get exposed to the dialogue, the walls, the us-v-them thinking. But then I end up getting pulled in because someone's hollering at me that, hey, they're talking about you again and making assertions about you and your operation again. Greeeaaaaat.<br/><br/>Is Evil Hat indie or not? Yes and no. (And yes, and no, and yes, and yes, and no, and yes -- just trying to keep up with the label!)<br/><br/>Do I care if Evil Hat is indie or not?<br/><br/>Should you?<br/><br/>Not at fucking all. <br/><br/>Unless it's really important whether or not the hat's flag flies over whatever tribe you're grunting and flailing about your membership in today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294944/#Comment_294944" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T11:24:58+00:00" title="September 28, 2010 11:24AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RE Evil Hat's arrangement with Chad: I'm cheerfully corrected.

They would be hired by the creators. That sounds like what Evil Hat is doing with Chad.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ul>\n<li>If yes, how?</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Let's say I know a lot about printing and distribution, but I'm not a game designer. And let's say I know lots of game designers, typesetters, illustrators, and the like. And I get them together, and we figure out what everyone's percentage is of a project, and we publish it. And then I screw the pooch somehow, or maybe they just think they can do a better job, <em>so they can take all their work and do whatever the fuck they want with it</em>.</p>\n<p>Of course, we've got a contract that says x% and y years and all. But nowhere does it say that I have a right to their creation. I can't print it without their say-so, I can't keep them from printing it themselves (at least not outside our contract), or deciding to give it away as free PDFs, or anything.</p>\n<p>I'd guess that "y years" is quantitatively relevant. Like, we figure out how long it takes for a game to become a "success" \u2014\xa0let's say 5 years. So whatever they do, I continue to get my percentage for 5 years. You'll note that it's to my benefit that they take their business elsewhere \u2014 less work for me for the same money. On the other hand, I probably like what I do and want other people to do it with me. So I'll do a good job until I can't.</p>\n<p>As a publisher, I'm therefore not at cross-purposes with the creators.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ul>\n<li>Once you hire a freelancer, are you no longer indie?</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Independence is in what you do, not who you are. If Hasbro hired me, I'd still publish independently.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ul>\n<li>Or does it depend on if the freelancers own their work?</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>As long as "freelance" and "IP owner" aren't mutually exclusive, yeah.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ul>\n<li>If yes, when we say "own" what do we mean? If you hire me to write a chapter, I can own the writing but do I also own the ideas portrayed in that writing? What if those ideas are directly linked to other ideas I don't own?</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>IP law is pretty clear on that, man. You know it better than I do. Ideas are not \xa9 until they're expressed, not patentable until there's a process or product, not trademarkable until they're clearly visible and used in commerce.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ul>\n<li>If I hire an artist to draw a character and I want them to own their work, what does that mean? I understand that they could for example re-sell the image but can they re-sell the idea behind the image? What if in creating that image, they also helped defined the ideas behind it which then inspire other aspects of the work I wasn't paid for? These aren't theoretical examples, disputes like these happen all the time.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Ideas aren't copyrightable. You know this very, very well. Why are you arguing this?</p>\n<p>I don't understand why you're asking this, but to clarify for everyone who doesn't know:</p>\n<p>Mickey Mouse is <em>trademarked</em>. That's why you can't make other stuff that looks like Mickey Mouse without being sued in civil court: because it confuses the customers of Walt Disney and dilutes the power of their trademark. Particular pictures of Mickey Mouse are <em>copyrighted</em> by whoever drew them (or whoever they signed their copyright over to \u2014\xa0probably W.Disney CO.)</p>\n<p>So, if I drew a character for your game, I own the drawing. If I trademarked the "distinctive likeness" of the character (which is expensive) because I'm doing business with the image, you either pay me my terms to use it or I sue you for trademark infringement.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ul>\n<li>If I want an editor to own their work, what exactly do they own?</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>That's a good question, and one Ben and I have laughed about. I guess it means I'd have to start from the first draft he gave me feedback on.</p>\n<p>It also means that I needed his permission to get it translated, which I got.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a line drawn between creators and people providing services that involve no idea generation? For example, we don't do our own printing, provide our own web hosting, and so on. Those are all services that we can pay for that don't generate ideas but handle mechanical tasks.

designers, you are wrong about one thing.  "Indie" as the term was originally adopted by the rpg crowd, has always included ownership/control over publication.  Here's <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=388.msg4546#msg4546" rel="nofollow">a thread</a> from 2001, for example, wherein Ron and others define "indie" as maintaining full control over the rpg product.  I don't think you can claim that the definition has really been changed by some elite group.<br/><br/>For certain people, indie is a political statement.  For others, it's a marketing term.  For others still, it's a flag for a certain style of game.  My point is that the term has been co-opted by different groups for different purposes.  That doesn't mean the original definition has changed.<br/><br/>That said, everyone is obviously allowed to make up their own mind about how they want to publish.  If it works, great.  What we should be evaluating is how well the indie model works, or doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/drnuncheon" title="drnuncheon"><img alt="drnuncheon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/drnuncheon">drnuncheon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294994/#Comment_294994" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T13:23:06+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  1:23PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2010 1:25PM by drnuncheon.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite><br/>Wolfe: My supposition is that Chad licenses Evil Hat the right to publish, without his oversight, for a certain period of time or - more likely - a certain number of books, after which they renegotiate. That's how I license derivative works, like the Italian Dogs in the Vineyard.</blockquote>\nDoes that mean that Dogs is not indie? Or is it just the Italian translation that is not?<br/><br/>The thing is, the idea of a game being indie as in creator-owned doesn't make a difference to the player (the game plays the same) or the store (except inasmuch as it might be more difficult to get ahold of).  The only person who is really invested in whether a game is creator-owned or not is\u2026the creator.<br/><br/>If you decided to get out of the game business and inexplicably sold Apocalypse World to Hasbro, the game hasn't changed.  It's still influencing and influenced by the same school of design that it was before the sale.  People are going to want to talk about it in terms of that, and they need a term.<br/><br/>There was a discussion in the front of one of the old D&amp;D books about all the different ways "level" is used in the game.  "indie" is even worse, because of the tight association of a certain school of game design with the concept of a certain type of publishing. You can be clear about which one you mean on the publisher end by saying, I dunno, "creator owned" or something, but there's not a good name for the school of game design side, which leads to it co-opting the indie label and causing arguments when people misread (sometimes intentionally) which one you mean.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is, it should never be a surprise when the general public co-opts a piece of jargon and uses it to mean something different than its creators intended.  The average gamer (present company excluded) isn't going to talk nearly as much about who owns the game as they are about how it plays. They're coming from a different perspective, they have different word-needs to be filled.<br/><br/>So, discussing whether or not EH is "indie" from a publishing perspective isn't really productive for a question like this.  Discussing if FATE is a game system that has something in common with and may be attractive to players who enjoyed other "indie-school-of-game-design" games is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295000/#Comment_295000" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T13:37:29+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  1:37PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua,<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for answering my questions!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think this is relevant to this thread but just to quickly clear up any possible confusion... I agree that ideas aren't copyrightable (I'm not questioning that) but when you enter a contract, you can agree to restrict your rights. For example, you can agree via contract not to use certain content for a specified period of time. The content itself doesn't have to be protected in any way and someone else who did not sign that contract could use it as normal.

And there are in fact painters who choose to buy from them not because they like the paint, but because they like the idea that they're buying from those manufacturers.  They're usually the ones who point out how expensive and hard-to-get it is and how it's manufactured, rather than discuss what they actually like about the paint and what they can do with it that they can't do with paint they could buy at Posner's.<br/><br/>There are also artists who buy it because they genuinely like the paint, of course.  <br/><br/>As far as the manufacturer is concerned, though, a customer base is a customer base, whether they're buying because they like the specific qualities of the product or just because they like being the sort of person who buys that specific product.  I'm sure some of the boutique paint manufacturers do what they do for appropriately cranky artistic reasons, and some are in it just because they can make money catering to people who like to buy from boutique paint manufacturers...but when it comes down to talking about how it's sold and who's buying it, it's hard not to see it as just being cola wars.

That's fine. You don't care if a game is indie produced or not. I care if my food's local, and maybe you don't. That doesn't mean that there's a reason to start calling everything that's good food "local".</p>\n<p>As far as I can see, the controversy here is this:</p>\n<p>For the last decade, a small number of folks have been creator-producing RPGs and, for years, had to put up with everyone telling them in no uncertain terms and in language that I (I!) won't use in public, that they're wasting their time, retailers' money, and Mark Rein\u2764Hagen's ... something, and generally "destroying the hobby". We've had really, <em>really</em> unpleasant things said to and about us because we were doing something that, for reasons unclear to me, threatened the folks telling us this.</p>\n<p>But now, ten years on (five years for me, personally), after we've been saying, "I can do it, you can do it, and what makes it possible is creator ownership", this crap sprouts up where people feel like they're being excluded from the creator ownership club called "indie" because they don't follow the creator ownership model.</p>\n<p>Here's the thing: <em><strong>it's not a club</strong>. It's a bunch of <strong><em>people who are doing something and supporting each other</em></strong> in doing it. We support each other because we're all engaged in doing the same thing, and we need each other to learn how to do it better. If you're doing something else, you don't get to say it's "indie" just because it's "good". You get to say it's "indie" if it's *produced independently of a separate publisher</em>. Whether or not it's good.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295386/#Comment_295386" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T12:14:27+00:00" title="September 30, 2010 12:14PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2010 12:17PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>There is nothing, nothing about those games at all that justifies putting them in the same category except that the creator owns them, and putting them in the same category means that one cares more for who gets the cow than whether the beans are magic.</blockquote>\nI'm fairly sure that the people on the beef-eating side of the equation care about that.<br/><br/>"Indie" as a <i>marketing</i> term, on the bean-planting side of the equation, I think is more an identity thing than a quality thing, or category thing.

The problem is that those qualities get mixed into the definition of "indie" (for good and ill) which creates a very skewed picture of who is and is not indie. The reality is that you can be perfectly indie, with full creator ownership and such, and produce very non-boundary-breaking games.

What publisher would have been so dumb as to print Amoeba, Continuum, deadEarth, Forgotten Futures, Ironclaw, Nobilis, Kobolds Ate My Baby! or pretty much any of the squintillion creator-owned games in the two prior decades of the hobby? What do you think the early part of the hobby was like? Do you think that, like, an editor at Random House decided Call of Cthulhu was a really good idea and decided to focus group it for a while?</blockquote>\nIt's true that there were independently published prior to the late nineties, but they certainly flourished after that point far more than earlier.  Notably, your list of RPGs are all late nineties: <br/><br/>Amoeba (1999)<br/>Continuum (1999)<br/>deadEarth (1999)<br/>Forgotten Futures (1999)<br/>Ironclaw (1999)<br/>Nobilis (1999)<br/>Kobolds Ate My Baby (1998)<br/><br/>In general, I agree that while the means of production might not matter to you, I think it's reasonable for them to matter to some people - for the same reason that the term "indie" matters to many people in music, movies, comics, and otherwise.  That's because they're not looking for a set of particular concrete qualities in a game like does it have psychic powers or use funny dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295459/#Comment_295459" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T22:58:58+00:00" title="September 30, 2010 10:58PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I did intentionally pick them for exactly the reason that they came about at the end of the 90s.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295465/#Comment_295465" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T00:03:19+00:00" title="October  1, 2010 12:03AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2010 12:03AM by Hans_c-o.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The idea that "indie" RPGs started...at the end of the 90s, is complete insanity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>(I did intentionally pick [those indie rpgs] for exactly the reason that they came about at the end of the 90s.)</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295479/#Comment_295479" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T06:52:33+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  6:52AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, the only people who say anything about the Forge "inventing indie games" are people who hold it up as a straw man to try to make the point that the whole thing is ridiculous. <br/><br/>Of course indie games predate the Forge. Major Wesley was publishing indie war games in the 60s. Moreover, the very first article posted at the Forge, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/12/" rel="nofollow">The Nuked Apple Cart</a>(dated as it may now be), was speaking to other indie game designers. <br/><br/>In the late 1990s, Print on demand was still coming into being, and it would be years before it could produce anything of acceptable quality. <br/><br/>Digital distribution meant you snailmail me $5 and I'll email you a text file. <br/><br/>And the conventional wisdom was that to be successful in RPGs, if you couldn't sell your game to a publisher, you needed to print no less than 20,000 copies of your game and have at least 6 supplements in the can. Otherwise, no distributor will touch you. Without a distributor, no retailer will carry your product. And since retail is the only way to get your product into the hands of the customer, you can forget about success unless you follow the conventional wisdom. <br/><br/>Every year, we tour the floor at Origins and Gen Con, and without fail find somebody, even in 2010, who has bought into this conventional wisdom. They have spent their inheritance or taken out a second mortgage on their house. And they're not going to see that money again. <br/><br/>Ron planted his flag at the Forge by stating that it didn't have to be that way. It seems obvious now, but it wasn't back then. Sure, there were many other indie designers out there, but many of them were taking enormous risks. <br/><br/>The Forge cam together as a mutual support society for indie designers who were ready to throw conventional wisdom out the window and blaze their own trail. And because it was a new trail, everyone taught each other and learned from each other. Everyone learned about digital distribution and marketing together, tested the PoD waters together, etc. <br/><br/>Design and content were and always have been secondary to that one overriding idea. As Joshua has pointed out, if indie games do different things in design, that is an emergent property of the emphasis on creator-owned and controlled publishing. But in itself, design, innovative or not, has no bearing on whether something is indie or not. <br/><br/>That's why all those different and varied games fit into the same bucket. Indie is not a content category, design category or popularity category. It's a publishing category. <br/><br/>Should a game's indie-ness matter to you as a player of games? I don't see why it should. It doesn't to me. I'll buy and play a good game whether it's published by Vincent or WotC. <br/><br/>At the same time, I don't want anyone involved in making games to lose their shirt doing so. I don't care if something is indie or non-indie, so long as everyone involved is treated fairly. But it is important to me that people know the indie option is there, that if they choose, they can do it themselves in their own way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295490/#Comment_295490" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T07:35:26+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  7:35AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor O</cite>Jason, the only people who say anything about the Forge "inventing indie games" are people who hold it up as a straw man to try to make the point that the whole thing is ridiculous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>RPG's simply discovered at the end of the '90s what comics discovered a lot of years before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor O</cite>Should a game's indie-ness matter to you as a player of games?

Major Wesley was publishing indie war games in the 60s. Moreover, the very first article posted at the Forge,<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/12/" rel="nofollow">The Nuked Apple Cart</a>(dated as it may now be), was speaking to other indie game designers.<br><br>In the late 1990s, Print on demand was still coming into being, and it would be years before it could produce anything of acceptable quality.<br><br>Digital distribution meant you snailmail me $5 and I'll email you a text file.<br/><br/>And the conventional wisdom was that to be successful in RPGs, if you couldn't sell your game to a publisher, you needed to print no less than 20,000 copies of your game and have at least 6 supplements in the can. Otherwise, no distributor will touch you. Without a distributor, no retailer will carry your product. And since retail is the only way to get your product into the hands of the customer, you can forget about success unless you follow the conventional wisdom.<br/><br/>Every year, we tour the floor at Origins and Gen Con, and without fail find somebody, even in 2010, who has bought into this conventional wisdom. They have spent their inheritance or taken out a second mortgage on their house. And they're not going to see that money again.<br/><br/>Ron planted his flag at the Forge by stating that it didn't have to be that way. It seems obvious now, but it wasn't back then. Sure, there were many other indie designers out there, but many of them were taking enormous risks.<br/><br/>The Forge cam together as a mutual support society for indie designers who were ready to throw conventional wisdom out the window and blaze their own trail. And because it was a new trail, everyone taught each other and learned from each other. Everyone learned about digital distribution and marketing together, tested the PoD waters together, etc.<br/><br/>Design and content were and always have been secondary to that one overriding idea. As Joshua has pointed out, if indie games do different things in design, that is an emergent property of the emphasis on creator-owned and controlled publishing. But in itself, design, innovative or not, has no bearing on whether something is indie or not.<br/><br/>That's why all those different and varied games fit into the same bucket. Indie is not a content category, design category or popularity category. It's a publishing category.<br/><br/>Should a game's indie-ness matter to you as a player of games? I don't see why it should. It doesn't to me. I'll buy and play a good game whether it's published by Vincent or WotC.<br/><br/>At the same time, I don't want anyone involved in making games to lose their shirt doing so. I don't care if something is indie or non-indie, so long as everyone involved is treated fairly. But it is important to me that people know the indie option is there, that if they choose, they can do it themselves in their own way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nI want to address a few things but first I want to say... 100000% yes what Thor said!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295516/#Comment_295516" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T08:33:07+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  8:33AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor O</cite>The Forge cam together as a mutual support society for indie designers who were ready to throw conventional wisdom out the window and blaze their own trail.

And movies before that. You can't really change anything that matter until you have the control of the means of production. And "creator owned" is a meaningless soundbyte, if you don't have the economic leverage to use that ownership.<br/><br/>The Forge, and so storygames, are built around that. No self-publishing? No Sorcerer, no Dust Devils, no Universalis, no My Life With Master, no Burning Wheel. No Dogs in the Vineyard, Nothing.<br/><br/>What kind of publishers would have been so "dumb" to publish these strange kind of games, instead of "what sell"? </blockquote>\nI think Jason's first impression of Moreno's words are initially understandable but given that:<br/><br/>1. English is not Moreno's first language.<br/><br/>2. In context, it's clear to me and others in this thread that by "discover" Moreno did NOT mean that before the 90s "indie" did not exist but instead that there was a very strong trend towards indie that built incredible momentum around that time. It's not about absolutes. Before this date... nothing, after this date... everything. He's talking trends. The Forge did NOT invent this trend (usually no one invents trends and if you were to try to trace them to their source it would likely not start at the Forge but companies like Snapple outside of RPGs or people like Monte Cook within RPGs). But the Forge rallied together to take advantage of the new opportunities that were developing and teach people how to make best use of them. Thor lays all this out really well in his post above.  <br/><br/>3. Yes Moreno used the word "discover" incorrectly. Yes people who use absolutes, "no one is saying this" will often be proven wrong because inevitably if you look hard enough you can find an edge case. Moreno didn't mean "creator owned was invented in the 90s". And people saying "no one is saying this" most likely meant "overall what most of us are saying is". It's like when people state an opinion but don't say, "in my opinion" but in context it's clear that is what they mean. Or if it isn't clear, we can get clarification. <br/><br/>4. Moreno has stated that "creator owned was invented in the 90s" wasn't what he meant to say. And that English is his second language. I personally think we should cut him some slack. English is also my second language and I would hope people are more charitable, especially when we offer clarification. <br/><br/>Jason's first impression was understandable although not universal and now that it's clear it was a misunderstanding and/or miscommunication, that we can hopefully move on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295530/#Comment_295530" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T09:03:17+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  9:03AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor O</cite>Levi, it was a new trail because all the technology around publishing was changing at the time.

It's my bad, I apologize, Moreno. I shouldn't have nitpicked about the "discovery".  Of course the vast majority of games created during the history of the hobby were creator-owned, even a brief perusal of the list will show that. <br/><br/>The avoidance of the distro system is/was huge. My recollection of reading those early days on the Forge was that it was a big step.  It shook up the ways a lot of people did business. I have no problem calling this attention to the distro system a Forge innovation.  As a game player, the distribution system distorts my aesthetic options for financial reasons - anything that reduces its influence is a good thing. But as others pointed out in the thread, creator-owned games can and do go into three-tier distribution. That has nothing to do with the "indie"-ness under the current definition.<br/><br/>Back in the 2000s when people were fighting over what "indie RPG" meant, here is the definition I proposed: "An  indie RPG is an RPG that isn't Dungeons and Dragons."  I felt a definition that reflected accurately what the vast supermajority of the hobby was and wasn't doing was important.  When ~80 percent of the hobby (depending on what year you're looking at, whether you're looking at sales or play, etc.) is D&amp;D, to slice up that last few percent and try to fit more of it into the "mainstream" (my definition of "mainstream RPG" was "D&amp;D") than already is seems silly to me.  <br/><br/>This definition, however, is completely useless to people who want to make money off RPGs, so it was discarded.

Is there a list somewhere where a brief perusal will show what games are creator-owned?  If so, I'd like to hear about it.  I usually find it rather difficult.  From my collection, the vast majority of games - including virtually everything published prior to 2000 - are not listed as copyright by their author - but rather by the publishing company.  In some cases the company is owned by the author, but I don't assume that.  <br/><br/>Being creator-controlled does affect the content.  One example would be from Lee Gold's essay, "<a href="http://www.rpg.net/oracle/essays/censor.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Self-Censorship</b></a>."  There she talks about her design choices.  From the start of it: \n<blockquote><i>I have never received any explicit order from any publisher or editor to censor any elements from these sourcebooks. I got the idea all on my own that Fantasy Games Unlimited, Steve Jackson Games, and Iron Crown Enterprises didn't want my sourcebooks to include even a few paragraphs about Japanese or Norse attitudes towards homosexuality. So, even though my researches indicated this was a significant aspect of the culture, I didn't touch it in my books.<br/><br/>It wasn't that I was unwilling to disagree with my publishers. My Vikings sourcebook occasioned a long though friendly argument with my editor about Viking attacks on castles. My source material seemed to agree that Vikings had been unwilling to assault even a minimal motte and bailey castle, let alone more elaborate fortifications. We eventually compromised on the statement, "the raiders would ride inland, pillaging but steering clear of castles and other fortified areas....However, a few adventurous Viking relished the challenge of storming a motte and bailey castle, which bore little resemblance to the grand stone edifices which would tower above the fields and towns of Europe centuries later."<br/><br/>Eventually it occurred to me to wonder whether I'd been wrong to ignore cultural attitudes towards homosexuality. So when I next spoke to management people at my various publishers, I asked them. They said they were very glad I hadn't included the material, and -- yes, indeed -- if I had, it would have been deleted. RPG publishers don't boggle at gaming material featuring amoral bloodshed, torture, drug addiction, vampires, succubi (all strictly heterosexual, in every piece of artwork I've seen), and even demons -- but homosexuality seems to be beyond the pale.</i></blockquote>\nNow, some people might think, "Land of the Rising Sun?

And you'll play it safe.</blockquote>\nJoshua: well said, and I do understand where you are coming from.  It's exactly that influence that is causing the confusion!  The indie publishing method has become so strongly associated with a certain type of game that people are using the term for that type of game, whether it is indie-publishing or not.<br><br>But the world of gaming and game publishing is not static.  D20 saw an enormous horde of indie publishers come (and go), but many of them were "playing it safe" in terms of game design.  Some of those folks are still around publishing for Pathfinder or 4e.  There's also the old school/retroclone community - you can't get much more "traditional" in game design than that, but they are equally indie publishers. Creator-owned [i]allows[/i] you to take risks with your designs, but it does not necessarily encourage it.  <br><br>On the other side of the fence, many of the creator-owned "risky" games have started to influence traditionally published RPGs. There's no way that (say) Margaret Weis Press' Leverage or Smallville games are indie in a publishing sense, but you also can't deny that they are strongly influenced by techniques that are used in indie-published games.  People are going to want a term to refer to that type of game design, and unless a better option presents itself they are going to use "indie" because of the strong association you brought up between indie publishing and that particular school of game design.<br><br>I guess what I'm saying is, anyone who really wants to preserve the word "indie" as meaning "creator-owned" had better get an alternative out there fast if they don't want the original meaning of the world to get diluted &amp; lost.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295951/#Comment_295951" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T11:51:51+00:00" title="October  5, 2010 11:51AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: drnuncheon</cite>The indie publishing method has become so strongly associated with a certain type of game that people are using the term for that type of game, whether it is indie-publishing or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: drnuncheon</cite>I guess what I'm saying is, anyone who really wants to preserve the word "indie" as meaning "creator-owned" had better get an alternative out there fast if they don't want the original meaning of the world to get diluted &amp; lost.</blockquote>\nWe are having this same conversation in Italy <i>all the fucking time</i>, but in the end I'm sorry it just shows how impoverished, how deprived of any real imagination the worldwide roleplaying geek community has grown to be. &gt;_&gt;<br><br>Where you say "a certain type of game", Jeff, I'd say "all kinds of game but the same old one", where the "same old one" is the reskinned AD&amp;D2/Vampire derivative* which is synonymous with "mainstream" in the highly inbred subcultural niche of RPG gamers. [And notice how the so-called Old School is <i>also</i> a reaction against that "mainstream" (originally, at least).]<br>Our being inbred with long spoiled, entrenched trends is the only reason why "<i>everything else there conceivably is</i>" passes for a "genre" in role-playing. Such a train of thought is poisonous to new ideas, as it leads to quickly dismissing them as quirks of their own "genre" \u2014 definitely not conductive of good game design. It just leads to ghettos.<br><br>And that's why we shouldn't have a word for "whatever variety of mechanics or thematic content the majority of diehard rpg geeks is calling 'indie' these days". In fact, as I have often advised my fellow Italians, we should be openly adversing any such word and actively sabotaging its use. We'd rather force people into considering each individual game on its own merits alone.<br/><br/>(* = We have a word for <i>that</i>, thanks to Moreno: we call it <b>parpuzio</b>, which sounds appropriately silly.

That means that people's ideas of "indie" are going to be driven by not only their publication status but also by the exemplars of each class (I can totally say I like the top 10 indie titles much more).  This confound would likely diminish if RPG publishers decided to start "indie" imprints and co-opt popular indie titles (I'm undecided on whether this would be good or bad).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296458/#Comment_296458" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-10T23:49:17+00:00" title="October 10, 2010 11:49PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you were to look for a game about something unusual - let's say about the cutthroat dirty competition between public television gardening show hosts - you wouldn't know how to start? You'd be just as likely to find such a thing in a store that's supplied entirely by Alliance, and carries the full line of GURPS, D&amp;D;, and Vampire, as you would looking at the Un-Store or IPR or coming here and asking around?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuz I know what I'd do if you came here. I don't know how I'd help you if I were the guy with the Alliance-backed store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The answer is Contenders, of course. )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\nAround here in Spain we have a publisher - Edge Entertainment - which is specialized in mixing inits catalogue very well known titles as CoC with games with premises as unusual as the one you mention. They have a heavy presence in stores. Many FLGS carry a small number of indie games, but they carry them, nonetheless, as many FLGS have a section devoted to imported games. So around here that would not be the situation. We have no Alliance, whatever that thing is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, why someone would be interested in playing a game about the fierce competition between TV hosts (or even boxers, as Contenders seems to be about) is beyond me. Nothing wrong with that, it is just that the premise doesn't interest me, and I don't imagine it being of great interest to most people. Businesses need to pay attention to most of their customers, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296459/#Comment_296459" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T00:34:40+00:00" title="October 11, 2010 12:34AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>Once you are having to fight for your definition of a word, or attack people for casual use of a word which does not match your definition, you know you are losing.

So whilst you can say "on SG we mean creator-owned" as your audience widens its very hard to maintain that specific a definition.

However, outside of the contexts you can influence the meaning of the term will escape you. What the regular consumer at GenCon defines as indie will vary greatly from your definition.

I have no problem with words which have a specific and a general use - for example "energy" has a lay use and a technical meaning. But when you say "on SG we mean creator-owned" and clearly there is no SG consensus, then even that doesn't apply. I say, give it up. Creator-owned is unambiguous. When Vincent, Ron and about twenty select others are in a room, indie is probably a useful technical word. Otherwise, it's just a source of argument.<br><br>One other point - there are many, many creators who are not interested or even actively bad at the other activities involved in getting a game from brain to multiple tables. That does not preclude them having control over which channels to market they chose, the appearance of their work or even how they are paid. Often, they simply don't care how their work gets to market, as long as they are paid. In other fields, agents deal with negotiating these matters.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296489/#Comment_296489" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T09:45:17+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  9:45AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>I don't know Rafu, your approach seems to be self-marginalizing.</blockquote>\nColor me puzzled.
