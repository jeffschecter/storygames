                    Heya,<br/><br/>I've owned Ars Magica for years now, but never played.  I own the 2nd edition (produced by White Wolf) and the Newest Edition from Atlas.  The thing that stops me from running this game is really knowing how troupe play works in play.  If anyone has any experience using Troupe play in Ars Magica, I'd be keen to hear it.  Specifically, I'm looking for the following:<br/><br/>-How did character creation work?<br/>-How did various players choose various characters to play?<br/>-How did players transition from one character to another?<br/>-How was the simultanious play of two or more characters go?<br/>-What were the plusses for Troupe play during your game?<br/>-What were some of the drawbacks?<br/><br/>Thanks guys! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>

                            When I played ArM last, character creation for magi and companions went a lot like it does in other old-school RPGs, although our troupe did engage in a little bit of top-level discussion about the background of our covenant before anyone decided which characters they were going to play. We played a new, Spring covenant rather than an established one.<br/><br/>When it came to creating grogs, we sat around and threw out concepts, which one player threw onto a list. When a concept suitably excited one of the players, he grabbed that concept to stat out.<br/><br/>In the course of single adventures of actual play, there was not a lot of switching back and forth between characters. Rather, what would happen is that some situation would present itself, the council of magi would figure out who among the magi and companions was going to deal with it (sometimes with meta-considerations about making sure each player had a magus or companion to play), and those characters would be dispatched on what looks a fair bit like an old-school RPG adventure.<br/><br/>Of course, grogs were always brought along on expeditions. Some players became particularly attached to specific grogs, and wound up grabbing them to play, in both combat situations and roleplaying situations. There didn't seem to be a lot of difficulty in individual players switching roles back and forth (or assuming them simultaneously) on the fly, during play.<br/><br/>One of the big advantages of the part of troupe play where each player has multiple character, especially in Ars Magica, is that you don't have to give up having an interesting adventuring-type character when you choose to play a lab rat magus. (Laboratory work over the course of years can be a large and interesting part of player ArM, for those of you not familiar with the game.)<br/><br/>The main drawback is that it's really easy, in ArM, to lose track of an individual character's narrative thread because everyone is spinning so many plates.                        </div>

                            Yeah, what Jeff said.  (Hi, Jeff!)<br/>
<br/>
I've played ArM3-5, though most of our time was running 3rd and 4th edition.  Character generation for us was one of the least "Troupe-y" things, in that everyone kind of came up with their own concept for magi, companions, and (a share of the communal) grogs, and then we touched base with each other to make sure there weren't any huge problems with what we'd come up with.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, the SG would introduce a story and we really just played out council meetings, grog interaction, etc. based on which characters we thought would "go on the adventure."  So like Jeff, we didn't often experience a lot of character switching - one might play a certain grog on watch when the Quaesitor arrived, his magus in council discussing what was happening, and a companion on the covenant's sojourn.  Having said that, we'd all end up playing some grogs (heck, some stories were grogs only) and occasionally one's companion and magus would both have cause to travel together.  Again, echoing Jeff, some grogs just resonate with a particular person, or people really like the way person X plays grog Y.  Just make sure everyone has someone to play and gets their share of "air time"!<br/>
<br/>
I really find the flexibility of Troupe play to be important for both creativity and engagement.  Having different people run the story or play different kinds of characters injects a lot of freshness into things, and a group of people generally can come up with better ideas than a single individual.  More importantly, it allows everyone to be engaged in the process and empowered in that they have perhaps more control over the shared game environment than one would in a traditional single-GM-and-players model.  Plus a group of professionals sure can use having the burden of GMing spread out amongst their number!<br/>
<br/>
Besides Jeff's drawback, I'd also mention that with multiple SGs, one has to kind of establish "ownership" of story arcs.  So in our Corona Montis saga, I introduced stories involving the ancient Roman magician Tarquinius and the diabolical machinations of the Bishop of Carlisle...so it was understood that those story arcs were "mine" and any stories or dealings with NPCs in that arc were probably best hashed out by myself and the other SG beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, you'll love it.  It's a great setting, has nice rules, and Troupe play, once you get the hang of it, can't be beat.                        </div>

                            I played ArM 4 and 5. (In fact, I met my fiance during playtests for ArM 5.  Geeky, I know....)<br/>
<br/>
One of the nice features of troop play is that once you start doing it it becomes very easy to make everyone involved in what's going on.<br/>
<br/>
Say a party of Magi and Companions go off on an adventure, taking a bunch of tagalong Grogs.  During play the party decide to split up to follow different investigative leads.  No problem.  Everyone takes a character and moves on.<br/>
<br/>
But suppose there aren't enough grogs to go round?  No problem.  Just have the party run into another NPC and throw them to the player who's sitting idle.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty soon this approach leads to players self-inserting into scenes, taking on bit part roles and generally contributing to enriching the world and its inhabitants.  The degree to which this happens, of course, is the degree to which the group validates and endorses it.  In my experience this style works fine with GMs who're willing to roll with it and players who don't mind occasionally being told that it would be really helpful if NPC#214 could go do X, Y or Z.<br/>
<br/>
It's a fun way to play is what I'm saying.                        </div>
