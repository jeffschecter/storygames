Partially because our GM is in love with Apocalypse World (his first indie game). <br/><br/>We're still using the same stats, powers, talents, 2d10 roll, chart. But we're:<br/><br/>- Using Apocalypse World Moves.<br/>- White result is a miss and the GM makes a Hard Move.<br/>- Green is a weak hit (mixed result, success at a cost).<br/>- Yellow is a hit.<br/>- Red is a strong hit (hit + something crazy from our crazy awesome list).<br/><br/>But in AW, you roll 2d6 and add them together so the result averages to 7 which is a weak hit (but still a hit). But in FASERIP, we're rolling white results frequently, which in normal FASERIP is boring (for us) but non-deadly. Not so when the GM is making hard moves. We're also playing 80s X-Men power level characters which probably doesn't help. But we didn't want to change the dice or chart. So we implemented ideas from my D&amp;D 3E hacks:<br/><br/>- When you roll a white result, you get a chip.<br/>- You can't spend the chip on yourself.<br/>- After an ally rolls, you can spend a chip if you can help them in the fiction (we love teamwork).<br/>- Your ally can flip their dice. So if they rolled a 27, they can flip it to a 72.<br/>- As an added bonus, you get to do something when it isn't your turn, and it gives players more reasons to pay attention when it isn't their turn*. <br/><br/>*We play FASERIP on a weeknight with distracted adults, kids running around, people coming off of 12 hour work shifts, and an unpredictable number of players (from 4 to 10). It's the most chaotic group I play in but I love everyone involved (friends from high school).<br/><br/>The new changes have worked amazingly and what's great is we can still use 90% of the original material as written. The main problem is that since bad guys don't roll, we need to figure out what their stats do. We've come up with an informal guideline for connecting GM Moves to NPC stats. So if you try to fight someone with a high Fighting Stat and roll a miss, the Moves the GM can make are limited by the NPC's stats. The higher those stats, the more severe GM Moves are available.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360182/#Comment_360182" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T08:25:53+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  8:25AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like a metric tonne of fun!

I should maybe do that?  <br/>I'll just say that, that is not how I would "fix" MSH.<br/>Instead of the whole chip thing, why not just give Karma?  And allow players to give it freely to other players?<br/>I think it might be neat if Karma were two-sided, but I haven't thought that through too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360288/#Comment_360288" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T14:50:55+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  2:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> !!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360310/#Comment_360310" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T15:54:06+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  3:54PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I was going to say, it seems like Karma is already partway to doing what you want to do here, it just needs a more fleshed out economy. Actually a fleshed out Karma economy is a good idea no matter what else you do with the game. Karma is really a strikingly innovative mechanic with a lot of good things about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360311/#Comment_360311" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T15:59:03+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  3:59PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a very cool game, chaos and all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
