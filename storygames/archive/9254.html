The guidelines for running and modifying skill challenges are too vague.<br/>2. There's not much in the way of tactical options, and especially next to the rich combat engine there's a natural tendency to rush skill challenges.<br/>3. Skill challenges need to be run as conflict resolution, with interesting and viable paths from both success and failure<br/><br/>and the big fourth one:<br/><br/><b>4. Skill challenges benefit from both mechanically and narratively reactive elements.</b><br/><br/>Such as:\n<ul><li>a symbolic map-board</li><li>"yes, but..." complications on a failed skill check</li><li>rolls which reorient the conflict, changing to which skills can be used</li><li>costs for failure</li><li>side-benefits for success (such as long-term benefits)</li><li>benefits for using appropriate Powers</li><li>failures that cause special obstacles that need to be specifically addressed before the challenge can continue.</li></ul>\nSo my question, smart guys, is how would we translate point 4 into some quick, effective guidelines for GMs that are struggling with this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204830/#Comment_204830" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T17:31:40+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  5:31PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a symbolic map board comprised of narratively reactive elements, how about employing something like the <a href="http://billwhite.blogspot.com/2009/04/fourth-age-story-gaming-d.html" rel="nofollow">Deck of Many Things</a>, or possibly the <a href="http://www.everway.homecall.co.uk/Fortune.htm" rel="nofollow">Fortune deck from Everway</a>, and combining it with the idea of tying successes and failures to flipping over cards <i>and reading them to influence the progress of the skill challenge</i>. Even a standard deck of playing cards has meanings that emerge from its origins in the Tarot's minor arcana, so suits can be used for example to re-orient the conflict ("Failure on a spade! The challenge turns physical!"). Maybe this is all still too hand-wavey for some folks, but I think it's got potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204834/#Comment_204834" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T17:49:54+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  5:49PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well here is how I would do it. <br/><br/>First , forget symbolic map-board. Putting in a symbolic map-board no matter how kewl, is not in the purview of skill challenges but rather a hack of its own (and power to whoever is writting it , but focusing on advice for people more or less running a Skill Challenge from the book. <br/><br/><b>Defining Failure</b><br/><i>A guide to making skill challenges rock</i><br/><br/>Three out of the remaining 6 points all have to do with failure and for a good reason, its that thing that happens when you fail, and as such, happen fairly often. <br/><br/>Steps to making Good Failures<br/><br/>1&gt; <i>Not saying no or Failures are not negated successes</i><br/><br/>My first impulse with skill challenges where to make them task oriented. Either you succeed at your task or you dont. If you want more rpy skill challenges you have to take away the crop of punishment a bit. Failure of a skill challenge should never be the negation of success. If a skill challenge is to scale a wall or ford a river, the failure should never be You fail to scale the wall or you fail to ford the river?<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>First of all, its not interesting. If a skill challenge were so plainly pass/fail it probably should have been coded as a simple skill check instead. Skill challenges are a way of interacting with the situation. If the situation is pass/fail their's not much to interact with is there. <br/><br/>Secondly, if something is important enough to make a skill challenge out of , its important enough to let the pc's do it. You see this a bit in Call of cthulthu vs Trail of Cthulhu. Why does trail of cthulhu make the finding of clues a more or less given as apposed to frigging arround with your thumb up your butt trying to cajole the gm into giving you the next cookie? Because that's where the kewl is. Clues are important enough to the story that the players should get them anyway. If you want a literary example, it would be like a fantasy writter writting the kewlest chapter ever where their dude goes and fights thor and drinks ambrosia and gets hit on by hera and all sorts of kewl things, and then trashing it because ' that's not what happened, dude failed to climb the wall '<br/><br/>2.  <i>saying yes or failures are success with a cost</i><br/><br/>Now this is going to be a harsher point, but if skill challenges are important enough to put in , in the first place. That important thing they do should probably not be put up to the fickle chance of fate to determine if they infact take effect. Even with a success rate of 90% that means that 10% of your kewl is not getting threw and that sucks. You want as much kewl to get threw to your players as possible. As such failures should overwhelming be the same as the success but with a rider or amendum. <br/><br/><br/>3. failure ought to matter or riders and amendums <br/><br/>Failing sucks, its a fact of life. But failing in a game is a different prospect. Considering that something like half of all roleplayers are there more or less to eat cheeto's and to poke arround in your imaginary world, why not let the failures help them poke arround the world? Instead of failing the scaling the wall challenge, they accidently end up in the princesses chambers or if they fail to ford the river, most of the people make but the party is swept downriver into a kobold camp. It achieves exploration while still being a rider and amendum. I hear some people talking about impossing conditions and stealing healing surges and stuff like that. Weak sauce! If im going to be permitted to reference a book, let me quote from Kills Puppies for Satan. "Dont do it, that sucks" okay thats not a quote, but it works. KPFS has the adversarial and powerful gm figure necessary to make matters of riders and amendums work by promissing to hit someone with the fucking hammer of pain otherwise. (Imagine that whole binging on shrimp and pasta demon in dnd 4th edition, that's what im talking about.) People want the awesome and in dnd style games you get that with strong central vision aka a gm. What did you expect folks, this isn't some namby pampy indie game. Your are on the Reading Railroad so sit down and shut up and enjoy the ride. <br/><br/>That's what i would (and did ) write, hope it helps. <br/><br/>I look forward to equally useless guides !                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204845/#Comment_204845" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T18:59:59+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  6:59PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2009 7:00PM by Ry.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>focusing on advice for people more or less running a Skill Challenge from the book.</blockquote>Yeah, I think that's the angle I'm looking for here.

Exp points in D&amp;D have always struck me as basically the GM's budget.  On the trip from 6th to 7th level you can only throw so much adversity at the players, as rationed by the exp system.<br><br>So with this perspective I am very serious about rewarding exp for the adversity of skill challenges.  It's pretty hard to look at the exp/difficulty budget of monsters and transfer that over to skill challenges, so of course there's going to be some arbitrary conversion factors, but in D&amp;D I think a solid system of scalable difficulty needs to have an associated system of resulting (and appropriately scaling: no "twice as hard for 10% more exp") reward.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204880/#Comment_204880" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T05:55:49+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  5:55AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Umm, skill challenges have a pretty strait forward method of determining experiance for skill challneges. <br><br>A Skill Challnege of Level X and complexity Y is equal to a Y number of monsters of Level X. <br><br>Admittedly this is not made very clear in the section.

Sometimes it's essential and sometimes it's not.<br><br>- Skill Challenge to climb mountain to the dragon's lair and confront it as an "conflict with environment prelude to monster", yes failure should still see you face dragon but with it swooping down on you outside not you fighting it in contained environment.  Failure of "well I guess you don't get to confront the dragon at all" or "try again" is boring.  If the "promise of the adventure" is "fight a dragon" and that's the fun combat encounter, then it needs to happen.<br/><br/>- Skill Challenge to find the spy in the negotiations between the two powers and stop the spy directing the outcome of treaty as they wish, actually I think there true failure should be an option.  In narratives, as long as hero alive, all failure is temporary so really I mean "it should truly look like failure at that time and change the direction of the story".  Nope you didn't find spy, negotiations landed somewhere you assume the spy is happy with, play proceeds as everyone wonders "oh crap, what is about to hit the fan".  You find that out later, but at level of an entire adventure that wouldn't have been necessary if the treaty never signed.<br/><br/>I generally use skill challenges where failure cost is either: <br/><br/>(a) where failure = entering an encounter situation with disadvantage (either suprised, having lost a healing surge, some hindrance); success = entering with advantage (some degrees between possible).  An example of this in a WOTC published adventure is <i>Icy Spire</i> where in the blizzard challenge, individual skill failures may cost a healing surge as you get knocked about, skill challenge failure = start an encounter in disadvantaged spot, success means not so beat up and start encounter in better spot.<br/><br/>(b) where failure = movement down a less desired Player-driven narrative path (imagined as a game of snakes and ladders, you just slid down a snake).  Failing on the mini-challenge to see if your childhood sweetheart takes a renewed liking to you, failure doesn't just mean "not yet", "not this time", it will be they instead get more interested in that rival - your path towards that narrative goal has acquired an additional obstacle.   This really only works when Players really have bought into the narrative goals.<br/><br/>Rob                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204887/#Comment_204887" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T07:47:35+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  7:47AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2009 7:47AM by Ry.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Logos7, <br/>How does that interspersing thing work?

One talked about on other boards/blogs is the "scaling failure/success".  Each failure has a consequence building towards "total failure" with the cap is reached on failure rolls and each success has a success building towards "'total success".  You can fail without having attained any bit of success or having almost gotten all of it and vice versa.  I like this because even if success is pretty likely in a situation, that one failure roll still matters.  A menu of each sort is possible with some improvising to find the particular "smaller success or failure" that fits to the narrative/skill rolled.<br/><br/>For example, in the diplomatic engagement encounter I ran, each success represented more information being learned and/or positive relationship/perception into a particular NPC.  Apart from the final outcome, individual successes meant making friends, learning things (what depended on who you chatted up).  What the individual success meant depended heavily on player narration and skill chosen.  Each failure meant a particular venue of inquiry closed off, NPC comes to distrust you/see you coldly etc. - not just "closer to final failure".  Mechanically, there were only so many NPC's/factions to interact with so that # of failures = failure in challenge as no one was prepared to talk to you anymore.  Success meant learning things that weren't generally known, with final success meaning learning the key information that would empower one side in negotiation (and would also become personally relevant to PC's in a later adventure).<br/><br/>Mark - re time space.  I've found short (small # success required) challenges have worked okay as "this is a short event", but that longer ones definitely benefit from "each table round is a day, you can narrate anything that could come up in the day" type approaches.  One of most fun challenges we've had was a very short "Blame Game" challenge after an assassination attempt against diplomats the soldier PC's were guarding, where the challenge represented events in a meeting not lasting more than 30 minutes in which one of the PC's nemesis tried to portray the PC's as inept.  It was a staight 4 success/2 failure (yes unrevised rules) where failure meant PC's reputation suffered and they would not again be assigned diplomatic-guard type duties, success would mean they could shift blame as they choose and possibly establish connections with some influential types and would have more assignments of the "diplomatic mission" type.  It probably yielded the most fun to time ratio of any challenge yet - they failed spectacularly - creative attempts to do things where roll said it didn't work and thus turned around on the PC, one is now a clutz you don't take to high brow social events and the other is gifted with the ability to say exactly the wrong thing and should never be allowed to talk to anyone important.  Their subsequent 2 assignments have both seen them well away from the capital and on the front-line of fighting.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204911/#Comment_204911" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T10:32:19+00:00" title="May  2, 2009 10:32AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Short Story for the interspersing is that a challenge counts as a monster of its level for every complexity it has. <br/><br/>A Level 2 Complexity 2 Skill Challenge gives the same Xp as an encounter of two level 2 creatures. It can also be combined with an encounter (taking xp from the budget as a set of two level 2 creatures. <br/><br/>So A level 3 Complexity 3 Skill Challenge with two normal level 3 monsters [or a single elite level 3 monster]  is a complete encounter (xp wise it is just like 5 level 3 creatures) <br/><br/>I've not had a problem with the by the book method giving appropiate xp. More rolls = more xp which more or less makes sense to me. As far as treasure that is all handed out as packets for the gm to place where appropiate (and the book suggests using some of those packets to 'reward' non combat encounters. ) If other people want to go work from scratch, really that's perogative, but aside from the initial DC issues and the odd behavior of the 2x/x method of success/failure [ie it was sometimes harder to pass a less complex challenge]  I've been using them A-okay.  Im not trying to put people on the offensive, but assuming the system is broken, is a preety horrible way to evaluate the system. <br/><br/>L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
