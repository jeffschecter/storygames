Sometimes I write out things in my notebooks, to clarify them. I thought I'd write this in public for the extra challenge of articulating it coherantly (or trying to, anyway). I'm not honestly asking for help - but the perspective might help someone else beyond just me.<br/><br/>I think basically either the game is so simple I've found it's optimal path even as I write it up, or it's so complex it's never quite going to be written up completely - and I want to finish the game, not wollow in a design explorative. Worse, it may be complex but writing it out will (again) likely reveal the optimal path.<br/><br/>The absurd thing is gamism wise, when someone else throws down a challenge to you, you face none of these problems. You don't know anything about the game, and you put no effort into writing it up. It looks so damn easy from that side of the fence.<br/><br/>There's just no hook in any gamist design I think of because of this (err, I have written a bit here and there, but overall...). It's either transparent to me, or just a buttload of writing out stuff just in case it's unpredictable. Which would be okay except for the fact that even writing it out usually shows the optimal path - in other words, I finish the game before I finish writing it/thinking it out. So what's the point of writing out the rest?<br/><br/>Further aggrivating this is my goal of not slipping into the abstract. There are a ton of puzzles out there which rely on relatively abstract concepts to make a puzzle. Seduku is one - I mean, it's rules just come out of the blue. Good challenge - but doesn't apply to life much (indirectly it'd apply as it works out your brain, but nothing direct). I'd argue it's actually quite easy to make a puzzle if you take a bunch of abstract elements, hammer them together a bit and stick a win/lose condition on the end. Cause it's abstract and your drawing on whatever, your not likely to see the optimal path until actual play. And if you do see the path? Just add more abstractions until it's veiled. Ta da! Hmm, perhaps I aimed too high - should have aimed for traditional board game design first?<br/><br/>Anyway, this isn't just a reflective post. Here comes an idea!<br/><br/>I think giving up (conceding defeat? yes...) on the whole idea of obtaining a gamist hook, might be the best. I'm considering that instead, sympathy is the hook. More specifically there is an opportunity to sympathise (ie, rather than thinking I can force sympathy, I'll just provide an opportunity). So you have a character in some bad situation, and a series of resources spread around that might be used in some formulation to help.<br/><br/>However, again it's easy to see, even as you write it, whether you sympathise with it. So here's what I think is the interesting part - I think the character you play, will live his own little automated life for a period. I admit, I'm thinking about this in terms of programming a computer game, where there would be zero bookwork involved for the player, to have this (comp does all the work). While in table top there would be bookwork/handling time (note: also if your from a background where you must control every single action of your character, this might also seem a hurdle).<br/><br/>But basically you watch his little life as he goes about it, but it's rigged to go wrong. Bad things are introduced randomly (no, we don't need a GM to decide this in play). Nothing that'd kill him straight away, because that doesn't make it about how sympathetic you feel (if at all) for his life. You might feel sympathy for him if he's about to skin a knee, or perhaps only feel it after he loses a limb. Or not at all, which is fine too. Rushing to the death part clumps both those feelings of sympathy in with each other, which with me atleast, inclines me not to feel sympathy at all.<br/><br/>Okay, once you do feel sympathy (if at all), you take over the controls and try and solve the resource puzzle to get him to a predefined win state which ends the game on a happy note (assuming you don't get him killed on the way there).<br/><br/>Sympathy is both a hook and a randomiser - the longer it takes you to feel sympathy, the more bad stuff there is. From the get go, the games resource puzzle is as unpredictable as your own sympathy is. Hmm, I think I've even played this way in some sandbox computer games, where I'd become quite unsympathetic with the character and just driven him really hard, till he hit some bad situation/puzzle to pick my way out of.<br/><br/>If you don't feel sympathy, ah well, either watch him get killed - or if he lives on by himself, just quit once your bored watching. No biggie.<br/><br/><br/>The idea does, however, have a slightly nar like seduction, which might get in the way of completing the gamist design goal. However, it seems to have real potential. While the other avenues of approach seem to be dead ends (unless you go abstract).<br/><br/>There's the idea <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145962/#Comment_145962" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T19:03:54+00:00" title="May 25, 2008  7:03PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally not a gamist game, although it's a pretty cool idea.

The little dwarves consist of a handful of simple variables to define behavior. Couple this with eventual calamities: Strange moods which, if left unfulfilled, lead to various insanities; goblin sieges which can ruin civilians and soldiers alike; random monster attacks; etc. You've got the semblance of a poor little personality dealing with things far beyond its control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146071/#Comment_146071" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T19:24:56+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  7:24PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was actually dwarf fortress, specifically reading the stories of players, that sent me along this line of thought to begin with!
