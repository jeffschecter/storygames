                    Recently, I had a chance to play Bill White's Ganokagok, which was quite fun. While playing I discovered that a certain social aspect of how I play was coming to the forefront, something I can sum up best with the question: "May I make a suggestion?" Essentially, I passively offer an idea, keeping it as neutral from the authority side as possible. And this question is not merely rhetorical, I wait for a response or acknowledgment that suggestions are welcome. I've done the same thing while running and playing games like Inspectres and octaNe, which also clearly define narration rights. But I've also done it while running RPGs which have a strong GM presence, specifically distinct from the GM authority. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I escalate the suggestions with an offer of system assistance, which makes that social strategy strongly resemble the idea of pull, but this is atypical. Much more rarely, I will use my own authority to make the suggestion occur, resembling push. More usually, the acceptance or rejection of the suggestion (or even the offer of a suggestion) is a way for me to better understand what the other player wants. In essence, probing (perhaps there is a better word) is a social strategy focused on information and building trust, rather than distributing authority. <br/>
<br/>
In my experience, probing is very useful, for more than just mildly influencing play. Its also an effective way to build the level of understanding for pull, or to keep push and pull from causing problems. But what personally interests me about probing is that it lies distinctly outside of (lumpley principle) system, it does not distribute authority, instead it affects it indirectly, acting as part of a meta-system as it were.<br/>
<br/>
To my mind, probing is useful, but appears neglected in design and play. Is this truly the case? Should it play a more prominent role? How can we think design and play to enhance the use and utility of probing?                </div>

                            Wyrmy, you're talking about pulls, just without mechanics.  System is only the procedures by which the players decide what happens.  If you suggest something and they say "yes" or even "no" you're pulling and engaging the system.  You don't need points/dice/cards/levels present in order for it to be a pull.                        </div>

1: You could take some of your good medicine and buy a few levels of The Sun mana, it would give you a lot of medicine to call on. <br/>

1: You could use your new clout as Prophet of the Sun to get either of the girls.<br/>

In each case probing helps build understanding, it does not introduce elements into the fiction, it changes the context where that introduction occurs. Joshua, I don't think your definition of pull is accurate, in the very least it does not seem to mesh with the moments of crisis aspect of pull, namely about how there are thresholds where player actions are important enough to be attributed authority. The whole point of probing is to avoid at least direct manifestations of authority by keeping below that threshold of importance. And authority is not equivalent   to mechanics. <br/>

                            Without commenting on anything else at all, its worth noting the "moment of crisis pull" was mostly done in relation to how push and pull effect resolution only. There are other levels of things in push and pull that aren't just about resolution, and much of what Josh is talking about fits in there.                        </div>

So you mean that outside of resolution, push or pull does not have a threshold of importance? That seemed like an intrinsic thing, if you push and pull then you can be fairly certain the other person will be affected. To my mind, part of the point of probing is to stay beneath that threshold so as to be reasonably certain the other person's decision is less affected by the social interaction than the suggestion itself. If that really is a form of pull, then I'd at least consider it a significantly undervalued form of pull.<br/>
