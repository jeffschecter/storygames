I found the text a little tough to crack, and having everything spelled out in a step by step few-page summary was really helpful.<br/><br/>Pass over lots of time in between scenes. If you take this moment by moment the personal changes that happen won't make any sense. Your story will take place over weeks, months, or even years. Be sure you are going to the Next Important Thing, and not just following the grunts around.<br/><br/>Personally, I think this game really shines over multiple sessions. Like, two or three. One is tough.<br/><br/>The more detail you can put in the small things, the better. Like, don't go crazy and bog everything down, but the more real the better. The GM I played with was a veteran, and just the way he described a medical kit or a radio really did it.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!<br/><br/>Tayler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418269/#Comment_418269" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T07:19:32+00:00" title="July 13, 2013  7:19AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That all sounds good!<br/><br/>There's a rules summary (made by Adam Dray) <a href="http://ndpdesign.com/carry-a-game-about-war" rel="nofollow">you can download here</a> (scroll to the bottom), either to use or as a starting point for your own.<br/><br/>The most important thing, when I play, is to make sure stakes (in Squad scenes) are being set that really matter, and usually that are about how the character feels about what they're doing or about the relationship of the character to the other characters. "If I win, I guide us through the minefield without anyone getting hurt" is weaksauce. "If I win, I show the Sergeant that I actually know my shit about where the VC put their traps" is way better. It also makes it a lot easier for the GM to invert the stakes and make failure really hurt "Ok, well then if you lose, it'll obviously and clearly be your fault when someone gets blown up following your guidance".<br/><br/>I've never played a game that went for more than one session! I think it's because I tend to kill off Fodder quickly in squad scenes or off screen, and push each scene to snowball into the next. But there's nothing wrong with going slower (and it's cool that other folks are having that experience).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418271/#Comment_418271" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T08:33:37+00:00" title="July 13, 2013  8:33AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would read some Tim O'Brien!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418349/#Comment_418349" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T08:02:41+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  8:02AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Color is important. Steep the game in colorful details whenever you can. Learn a little about the weapons, electronics, tents and living conditions, food, countryside, and military chain of command and sprinkle it about.<br/><br/>Go back and forth between squad scenes and battle scenes. Doesn't have to be one-to-one, and probably shouldn't be, but definitely pace things so they feel the tension between war and downtime. Battle scenes are a yardstick of the breakdown of the military command as squad relationships fall apart. These guys are supposed to trust each other, and squad scenes put pressure on that trust. When shit goes south in a battle, that puts additional tension on subsequent squad scenes.<br/><br/>Admittedly, as a GM, I am terrible about pushing against Burdens. I encourage the players to push those and I try to follow along. <br/><br/>Have a few "set piece" scenes in your head.

Trying to shoe horn a lot of this style of game in to a single session doesn't necessarily mean the game won't run, but the intensity doesn't have time to build. As the game moves on scenes between characters are a lot more powerful if it's obvious what these characters have to gain and lose and if there has been time for the depth of the characters to be portrayed. WIth limited time the game tends to distill to instant gratification scenes, probably partially because players are aware that their 'screen time' is so limited, and the groundwork scenes get cut.<br/><br/>To get a similar effect with a single session game seems to need a much more focussed and smaller game. Ash seems to be adept at these. Family Affair (which I played at ConDamned) does just this.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418483/#Comment_418483" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T15:48:43+00:00" title="July 16, 2013  3:48PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ah, i'm just some guy, y'know. i think you've gotten a lot of excellent advice on this thread, and i hope the game goes well!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418610/#Comment_418610" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-18T09:49:23+00:00" title="July 18, 2013  9:49AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>ah, i'm just some guy, y'know. i think you've gotten a lot of excellent advice on this thread, and i hope the game goes well!</blockquote>\nYou're too modest Nathan! But it is interesting how when GMs get enthusiastic about a game (like <a href="/forums/profile/quincunx">@quincunx</a> above- kudos to you dude, my equivalent currently is Microscope) it kind of takes off in a different way than the designer sometimes intended and takes on a life of its own. If I can get round to it I'd like to start a thread about designers' experiences of other people (especially other designers) runnning their games. Maybe someone else can start one themselves.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
