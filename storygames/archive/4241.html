I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m gaming with my wife and sister, and so I end up with these really girly stories.  She thinks that <i>Bliss Stage</i> is working out so well because, every so often, I can insist on a combat mission with squicky aliens and giant fighty robots.  She may be right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this, to set up the first part of this Actual Play report.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\xe2\u20ac\u2122s right.  We\xe2\u20ac\u2122re back at it again.  Things get heated in the Peoria Resistance Group, Jude finally proves his worth as a pilot, and Marcus continues to suffer emotional trauma.  So suit up, strap in, and prepare for launch!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Diapers and Briefs</b><br/>\n<br/>\nOur opening action was less than enthralling.  Marcus had an interlude with Renee, his baby girl, which ended up involving a really nasty diaper.  I probably should have awarded Trauma for the experience.  I mean, squicky alien goo has nothing on the kind of bowel eruption that babies are capable of.  But Marcus took it all in stride, earning himself some Trust-Building with Renee.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we jumped to a briefing action.  Joseph broke into Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s apartment to summon him for the briefing.  Jared wanted to send Jude out to install a sensor package further north to act as an early warning system.  However, when Jared seemed unconcerned about keeping Joseph under control, Jude stormed off, shirking the mission.  So, once again, Marcus got the duty and suited up to head out into the dreamworld.  Beth was off-duty and Leah was all ready, so she would anchor for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Deep Probe</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI actually interlaced Marcus\xe2\u20ac\u2122s missions and Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s interludes for effect.  For this report, I will describe them separately.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore the mission, Marcus took a quick interlude with Leah, offering to talk to Jude about her.  I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t remember what we ended up calling that.  Probably Trust-building.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6begin briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nDeep Probe<br/>\nEvade patrols<br/>\nIf failed, fight enemy patrol<br/>\nScout location<br/>\nDeploy sensor package<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help the anchor player get into character, and to demonstrate our true weirdness, we have taken to assembling an anchor console on the table when we play, hacked together out of the electronic equipment that we have lying around.  Here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the photographic evidence:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://darkomengames.com/files/ActualPlay/BlissStage/BlissStageAnchors001.jpg" rel="nofollow">Crystal as an anchor</a><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://darkomengames.com/files/ActualPlay/BlissStage/BlissStageAnchors002.jpg" rel="nofollow">Another angle on Crystal as an anchor</a><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://darkomengames.com/files/ActualPlay/BlissStage/BlissStageAnchors003.jpg" rel="nofollow">Gabrielle as an anchor</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn particular, note the red and green dice on the black box.  Those aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t dice.  The green die is a \xe2\u20ac\u0153launch/dock\xe2\u20ac\x9d button, and the red die is the panic button.<br/>\n<br/>\nMock if you will, but it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s actually a lot of fun to set up the equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, Marcus was doing pretty well.  He was able to get the sensor package installed, but he was damaged by the alien goo that was dripping off everything.  So he hotshotted a goal:  \xe2\u20ac\u0153Gather goo sample\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  He was successful in this, but Beth completely lost contact with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Marcus is alone.  Things are falling apart.  An alien patrol is looking for him.  Two suns are burning in the sky.  Now they are beginning to strobe.  The aliens are stalking nearby.  There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s nowhere to run.  The power dies in the ANIMa.  Marcus curls up into the fetal position, holding himself and repeating, \xe2\u20ac\u0153They don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t find me.  They don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t find me.  They don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t find me.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nThey didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeah managed to re-establish contact and hit the panic button.  Marcus burst from the tank yelling, \xe2\u20ac\u0153They don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t find me!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nWe called for a post-mission interlude.  Leah hurried over to help clean Marcus off.  He took one look at her and fainted.  Trauma-Relief.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Jude takes care of business</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, Jude was taking care of business.  He broke into Joseph\xe2\u20ac\u2122s apartment and waited for him with a baseball bat.  When Joseph came in, Jude hit him with the bat, giving him a nasty bump on the head.  Then Jude took away Joseph\xe2\u20ac\u2122s knife and told him to leave him alone.  Joseph wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t happy, but Gloria intervened, telling Jude to leave.  He was polite to her and left without further incident.  We called this Intimacy-Building, but Joseph\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Trust was broken.  Joseph wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t harmed.  This is in part because the rules don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t allow for it, but also because Jude wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t trying to hurt Joseph.  He just wanted to make a point.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the Trust-breaking, we got a follow-up action to demonstrate the effect of the breaking.  So Crystal said that Jude went into one of the tunnels where no one else goes and cried.  No one likes him, and he is so very alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Matchmaking in the world of Bliss Stage</b><br/>\n<br/>\nJude ends up at the apartment where Marcus and Beth live.  He is sitting in there, talking with Beth, when Jared and Leah haul Marcus in.  Jared\xe2\u20ac\u2122s eyes meet Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s across the room, and Jared shakes his head in disgust.   The message is clear.  \xe2\u20ac\u0153If you had gone, this wouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have happened.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  The result of this interlude was Stress Relief.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe then had several interludes in short succession.  First, we had an absolutely delightful conversation between Jude and Leah.  Both of them were very awkward, and so we had one of those fitful \xe2\u20ac\u0153start-and-stop\xe2\u20ac\x9d conversations that happens between two people who really like each other but are too embarrassed to admit it.  It was painful and wonderful all that the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the other room, Beth informed Marcus that she was pregnant.   He was very happy to hear this, although Gabrielle reported later that his initial response was actually panic.  More on this later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Marcus and Jude had a little chat about women.  Marcus is only 17, but, compared to Jude, he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s an older, wiser guy.  So Marcus was explaining how to treat Leah, and Jude was hinting around his relationship with Rachel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the alarms went off.  Alien attack!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95095/#Comment_95095" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T10:24:01+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 10:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scramble!</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThere were getting to be far too many happy interludes.  Something needed to be done!  When in doubt, the aliens attack.  So I went with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI reused the mission layout from the original Scramble! which worked out pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Mission Brief</i><br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6begin briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nScramble!<br/>\nPrevent alien from reaching base<br/>\nDefeat enemy pilot<br/>\nIf either is failed, one non-pilot character is harmed (GM\xe2\u20ac\u2122s choice)<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end briefing\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>\n<br/>\nJude stormed out into the dreamworld, determined to prove himself to everyone.  He easily dispatched one of the alien remotes and then destroyed the alien goo that poured out of the downed remote.  Then he hotshotted a goal to take out Marcus\xe2\u20ac\u2122s target, too.  He succeeded, but not before his jamming gear was blown off his ANIMa.  In other words, his relationship with Rachel was broken.  Then Leah punched him out before things got worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcus was running cleanup.  The alien goo was pouring into the base, and he needed to stop it.  So he reached out with his power fist and grabbed a building to drop onto it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t remember exactly what the roll was, but it was terrible.  So terrible, in fact, that Gabrielle opted for Flashback.  If both Pilot Safety and Mission Success receive a (-) result, then the pilot may immediately call for an interlude involving a relationship not already part of his ANIMa.  If this flashback results in Intimacy-building, then the pilot may set Mission Success to (0), but he must incorporate the relationship into his ANIMa.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Gabrielle flashed back to a time soon after Marcus married Beth.  Things weren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t going well, so he went to talk to Eve.  She fed him cookies and made him laugh.  Before going, she patted him on the arm and said, \xe2\u20ac\u0153It\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be okay.  Don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t worry.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a ridiculous amount of positioning going on in this interlude.  The touching.  The \xe2\u20ac\u0153eating together\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  Crystal and Gabrielle both desperately wanted the Intimacy Building result.  Which I gave them.<br/>\n<br/>\nEve was the \xe2\u20ac\u0153wind beneath his wings\xe2\u20ac\x9d to Marcus.  So she manifests as jump jets.  Firing them, he burns up the alien goo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an interlude, immediately after the mission, Marcus strips off his pilot suit and stalks off naked.  He is tired and stressed and fed up.  Trauma-Relief.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we called the game for the night.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Reflections on the game</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWe discovered that we don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t share the same opinion about the characters.  For example, Crystal find Jude to be quite sympathetic, while Gabrielle and I aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really sure about him.  But perhaps the most profound difference has to do with Joseph.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal really doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t like Joseph.  Gabrielle understands him.  I really connect with Joseph.  Indeed, aside from the authority figure, all my characters are the children.  Except Joseph.  I have ownership of him, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we discussed the differences of opinions, Gabrielle connected it to our opinion of cops.  Crystal\xe2\u20ac\u2122s experiences of police officers are almost universally bad.  They are power-hungry, rude, and belligerent.  Whereas, for Gabrielle and myself, growing up in a small suburb, the police were polite and embraced as a positive part of the community.  We had a good conversation about some of this.  Perhaps Gabrielle or Crystal will fill in some of those details.<br/>\n<br/>\nGabrielle also has been gaining a painful amount of insight into the male psyche.  As I mentioned earlier, when Marcus found out that Beth was pregnant, her initial reaction was panic.  \xe2\u20ac\u0153Another responsibility!  I can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t handle this!\xe2\u20ac\x9d  She asked me about this later, and I told her that it was indeed a completely realistic emotional response.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also enjoying the interplay between the relationships in the real world and the ANIMa usage in the dreamworld.  When Rachel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s relationships was shot off Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s ANIMa, Crystal was thrilled.  It seemed to fit that point of the story, especially as Jude\xe2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Leah is developing.  And, in general, it just seemed to make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, it occurred to me that, once again, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m engaged with media that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s all about a lost cause.  I have a soft spot in my heart for desperate last stands and lost causes.  Just check out the video that I linked above.  That kind of thing moves me deeply.  What does that say about me?  Does that mean anything for my future?  I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve already played another session since these events, so I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m already behind on my reports.  You will hear more from us soon.  But for now, this is Seth Ben-Ezra, of the Peoria Resistance Group, signing off.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\xa6end transmission\xe2\u20ac\xa6                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
