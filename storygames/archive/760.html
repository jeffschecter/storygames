I ran some new players through my Lacuna "Orientation and Mobility within Blue City" scenario using the new and improved rules. The theme of the scenario is to learn to navigate around a dreamscape using pictures as literal and figurative clues, with plenty of reference to dream dictionaries for symbolic meaning. After insertion the agents buy a newspaper and the pictures on page 3 are their guide to a point that they will be collected from. It works out as a bizarre scavenger hunt. <br/>
<br/>
They found their way around the tram, met a bored chain-smoking priest, broke into a disused construction site, and got arrested by the constablutory. Their one phone call was a useful call out. They finished the course where they began, having made a circuit of the city.<br/>
<br/>
This new group took to it well I feel. They left the table intrigued by what Lacuna had to offer instead of just saying they "didn't get it," which I've heard in the past. They did approach some of the scenes with trepidation, wondering if a big bad HP was going to jump them but it had to be a short session, so I went easy on the evil.<br/>
<br/>
Jared's included new rules for Static (the mis-communication between agents and the outside world) that I think are great fun. In the game I played with him at a con almost 2 years ago I found the disconnect between the serious agents and our bored phone-jockey on the outside to be a really interesting part of the game and I've emulated it in my own sessions. Now it's written into the rules!<br/>
<br/>
There were two players and since I made "getting lost" a source of static in the game, it shot up pretty quick. I got to use a few bizarre happenings on them, but overall they avoided most of the static by being very careful about what to roll for.<br/>
<br/>
That's usually the behavior I see in Lacuna players. They see that ticking clock of their heart rate and they try to find ways to avoid picking up the dice. I usually just remind them how much easier their lives would be if they take the risks. Basically the Devil's Advocate. I did the same thing running Orpheus in which the players can "tap spite" to get more dice by letting their inner demons power up. I like doing it. I don't force them. It creates an odd paranoia in the players that I think suits Lacuna well. In fact this is also how I used to run "Paranoia." Interesting.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few omissions in the 2nd attempt. The rules for insertion no longer include details of agents losing each other in transfer, though the text mentions the possibility so I may keep the rules from the older version. Adding Static to these situations will make for a great emphasis on the way agents slip out of contact with the "non-dream" world.<br/>
<br/>
Players never seem to understand the power they actually weild in Lacuna and I'm not going to dispell their illusions. I'm always willing to empower them when they make decisions, but I think just guiding them along and making up the links in the chain as they go is really the best way to play a dream.<br/>
<br/>
I've got the fodder for an on-going campaign here and I'm looking forward to dragging other people into the Lacuna.<br/>

Eject now.                </div>
