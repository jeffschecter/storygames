                    I have a game idea bouncing around in my head that I eventually want to do.  Some of the details came from elements of <i>The Forever War</i> by Joe Haldeman.  "The Lucky Ones" is about soldiers who go to war and the sacrifices they make to fight.<br/><br/>In 2057, the Earth discovers wormhole technology that allows them access to the starts and immediately ends up at war with another species.  The United Nations recruits people to fight in this war and sends them in spaceships to far away star systems.  The difficulty is that the wormholes have relativistic effects and while each tour is only three months long from the point of view of the soldiers, longer periods of time have passed on Earth when they return.  Their lives change.  Their loved ones get on with their lives.  Governments rise and fall.  Terrestrial conflicts begin and end.  The time slips won't be as extreme as in <i>The Forever War</i> where after two tours, everyone the main characters knew had died of old age.  This will skip in smaller increments, I'm thinking five years or so, enough to impact the lives of the soldiers.<br/><br/>The game is not focussed on the time spent at war but on the time spent at home in between tours.  The PCs will likely be a group of friends who each enlists for his or her own reasons.  Many of the soldiers they fight with die in the war, but they will always survive...because they are "The Lucky Ones".<br/><br/>I was inspired to think about this game by stories about soliders in Iraq and comparisons to those who served in VIetnam.  There is a sacrifice they make that goes beyond the risk of injury or death.  They give up a piece of the life they are defending, sometimes with lifelong consequences.  Being a gamer, I think about this and then want to explore it in a game.  And when you explore something in a game, you take your issue up a notch...like making a three month tour bring you back home five years later.  <br/><br/>I don't want to design a system from scratch for this.  First, because I am not a game designer and thus not motivated enough to do so.  Second, because a new system for this could easily result in one of those "agenda" games which push a particular point of view even if I don't start out with that goal in mind.<br/><br/>So, the big question.  What system do I use to do this?  I'm leaning toward TSoY with a modified list of Keys, Secrets, and Abilities, but I'm curious about whether or not people have any other suggestions.  My vision for the game is still cloudy and malleable.                </div>

<em>TSOY</em> sounds ideal.  Disturbingly, so does <em>Sorcerer</em>.  One could also do it very easily with <em>PTA</em>.                        </div>

<i>Sorcerer?</i>  [Twitch...Twitch]  PtA probably isn't what I'm going for.<br><br>TSoY brings a lot to the table.  I like a conflict resolution system for this.  Pool refreshment encourages people to try to reconnect their characters after each tour.  In fact, it may be interesting to have them start after each tour with all pools empty.  After all, war is stressful.  The concept of transcendance works too.  I'm feeling pretty good about TSoY, but my knowledge of game systems is not encyclopedic [and much outclassed by many on this forum], so I wondered if I was missing an opportunity.<br/><br/>I'm still mulling over how I handle the life/world changes between tours.  Should I just handle that in a GM-like fashion, or have a system?  How would a system for that even work?  I like the idea of players discovering how things have changed, but on the other hand, I rather like the idea of players giving some input too.  I wonder if there is a way to split the difference.<br/><br/>I'm curious whether people have any brainstorms on how to handle these life changes in a collaborative or competative way.  I suppose I am in fact delving a little bit into design here...<br/><br/>[Edited for (inevitable) clarification and grammer check needs.]                        </br></br></div>

                            In your place, I'd anchor the changes in society to <i>particular NPCs</i> who, as a result of the change, want something from the PC.<br/>
<br/>
Which is immediately making me think of <i>DitV</i>, with each new era in society taking the place of a Town.  They come in, and everybody's glad to see them, and everybody wants something from them.  They then proceed to sling around their <i>emotional</i> authority, make a hash of some people's lives, improve others, and then get back on the wormhole road to the next era in society.                        </div>

                            The NPC's might also have aging to contend with.  I think it should be important that some NPC's die of old age, disease, accident, etc. between sessions.<br/><br/>Also, new ones should be born.  Heck, some might even be recruited into the force.<br/><br/>In addition to "Town Generation" there'd probably also need to be "Town Evolution" rules.<br/><br/>Contacts and relationships would probably also be very important.                        </div>

                            The DitV model is intriguing.  My concerns are thus:<br/><br/>1.  WIll this make it too much about the people they know and not the PCs themselves?  For Dogs, it really isn't about the Dogs wanting to fit in or maintain a life of their own.  It is about the effect they have on the world, whether or not it is for good or ill.  The soliders don't have that kind of responsibility.  In fact, they are already giving above and beyond for their world.  The question is do they get to share in what they are protecting and if so how?  Am I in danger of losing that element with DitV?<br/><br/>2.  How can I make the town creation rules fit?  I am a big believer in the idea that the town creation rules are the soul of DitV, and that if you don't have them, you might as well be playing a different game.  (Do I even really want it to be the soul of this game?...which in many ways is a restatement of issue number one.)<br/><br/>Tony: What do you think fallout would mean in this context?  Perhaps I could use it for the next iternation of "town creation" or whatever we call it.<br/><br/>Fred: Yeah, it makes the "town creation" possibly more complex.  I'm not sure the chain of sin, etc. will work, which is a major worry for me.                        </div>

                            1&gt; Dogs in the Vineyard is TOTALLY about the PC's and what they value.  It's not about them wanting to fit in (they don't) and it's not about them maintaining their lives (it isn't) it's about what they believe in.  Everyone has things they believe in.  Perhaps the hierarchy of sin can be adapted to address the level of "outsider-ness" that the PC is experiencing, and why.<br/><br/>2&gt; Forget "town creation"... since the whole world is your town, look at it more like "issue creation"... what is making the PC an outsider?

                            But does that take it too far from the DitV model?  I've discovered from experience that you can't strip much away from Dogs and not lose the magic.  As I said, town creation is the heart and soul of the game.  Without it, you have a rather clever resolution mechanic but not the awesome game that it is in full.<br/><br/>I'm not dismissing the system as a possibility, but I have lingering reservations.                        </div>

                            You build a new creation system.<br/>
<br/>
Absence leads to Weakness, Weakness leads to Change, Change leads to a Hard Choice, Hard Choices lead to Distance, Distance leads to Betrayal.<br/>
<br/>
Then you use that, plus the Fallout from the previous session, to see what sort of sins <i>against the soldier</i> people want to be judged and forgiven for.<br/>
<br/>
Absence:  You weren't there, and so your son, Teddy, didn't have a father to look up to.<br/>
Weakness:  He was getting beaten up at school, and his grades were slipping because he was so miserable.<br/>
Change:  Your brother, Mike, started spending much more time with him.<br/>
Hard Choice:  Teddy wanted Uncle Mike to go to the father-son picnic with him.  Mike wouldn't do it.<br/>
Distance:  Now Teddy barely comes home at all any more.  He's hanging out with a bad crowd.<br/>
<br/>
Mike:  Wants you to tell him that he did the right thing, but fears that he abandoned the nephew he loves<br/>
Teddy:  Wants his father to be easy to hate, but fears that he'll still love the old man, even knowing that they'll be separated again.<br/>
<br/>
Is that all about Mike and Teddy?  I suppose.  Sorta.  But it's also all about the soldier, right?                        </div>

                            *Now* this is clicking.  The endpoint is exactly right.  That's the psychology I want for the people left behind.  Getting on with their lives as they have to do but feeling guilty about it.<br><br>I also think that I would have to do this for each solider PC individually or at least have the chain apply to everyone in some way. I would obviously want to intertwine their personal issues as much as possible.  <br><br>I'll have to dig out my Dogs book and take some notes this weekend.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Eric, just have the military form homogeneous units, like they did in the Civil war (it was a bad idea then, and it is a bad idea now, but militaries grab bad ideas all the time)<br><br>In the interest of generating "unit cohesion" a unit is always formed from recruits taken from one place.  It could be a space station or a big city or a small town, but they are always from the same place.<br><br>That will allow the chains to cross over very nicely.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Definitely.  I plan to have PCs all know each other before their recruitment.                        </div>

                            I'm especially looking forward to a mechanism by which new recruits can be brought in when soldiers retire, effectively transforming PC's into NPC's and back again.                        </div>

                            Along the same lines as the 'unit cohesion', you could have all the families of these soldiers required to live on military bases.  That way you can have characters from wider backgrounds but still keep all the families near each other and intertwining.  I love this concept!                        </div>

                            The concept of "Family" may well erode deeply when a man's son is older than he is...                        </div>
