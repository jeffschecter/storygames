Sorry to start such a self-centered thread, but I figure at least some of the discussion in here will help other people too.<br/><br/>So, I am going to be at GenCon!  I am arriving mid-day Friday, and leaving at early o'clock Sunday morning.<br/><br/>I have tons of questions.<br/><br/>-Do I need to preregister for the Con itself?  Or should I just show up and buy a badge?<br/>-Can anyone lend me some crash space in their hotel room on Friday and Saturday nights?  (I will of course contribute financially as requested!)<br/>-How do I find games to play?  Do I have to buy these ticket thingies?<br/>-Can I be a G.O.D. GM?  I'd be perfectly happy just to hang around with a bunch of games and run them as needed.<br/><br/>Anything else you think I should know?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219880/#Comment_219880" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T13:37:34+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  1:37PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This much I know: you can't preregister now and a 4 day pass is cheaper than 3 one day passes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219884/#Comment_219884" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T13:40:45+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  1:40PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 1:41PM by Scott.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pre-registration is closed but you can buy a badge once you get there.  <br/><br/>I don't have any space unfortunately for someone to crash.  <br/><br/>The catalog is at <a href="http://www.genconreg.com/" rel="nofollow">Gencon Registration</a>  That is if you can get an account even though registration is closed.  <br/><br/>You are very much welcome at Game on Demand (we need as many people helping as we can get).

It definitely helped that I had gotten a room with Ralph and Matt Snyder, but the most important thing is to get there, introduce yourself around at the booths, and at Games on Demand. I think I played in 2 games with Ralph (an ill-fated prearranged playtest of Blood Red Sands, and a later pick-up of Reality Cops with James Brown) and none with Matt. Otherwise, I met a bunch of cool people, and played in several cool games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf gaming is your main priority, and indie gaming is a preference, spend a lot of time at GoD, and get to the Embassy Suites early on, preferably with a meet-up already planned. The games all tend to start at near the same time, (I can't recall the general time, sorry) and if you're even vaguely shy about asking to jump in on existing games, you'll find yourself without a game if you don't get in early.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220047/#Comment_220047" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T06:12:46+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  6:12AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2009 6:13AM by Adam_Dray.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I carry around one of those folder/organizer things with all of my prepped games.

Maybe also leave a similar thing on the table at the Forge booth. Yeah, it means that a million people will descend on the same restaurant at the same time. Whatever. We just want cool people who are interested in story games to get a chance to eat together. You don't have to chat with everyone (and it's impossible over about 6-8 people, anyway). If I have a good conversation with 5-6 people over dinner one night, I consider it a success. Beats sitting alone and eating the crappy hot dogs that the con sells.<br/><br/>Another dinner option: call out for pizza, and have it delivered to the Embassy Suites lobby while you're gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220941/#Comment_220941" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T08:49:07+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  8:49AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Adam,<br/>That sounds great!
