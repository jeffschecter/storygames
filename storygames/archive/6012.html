If you haven't posted already, please consider doing so.)<br/><br/>I'm going to phrase this question to Alan directly, but if you have a similar experience or insight, feel free to post as well.<br/><br/>Alan, holy crap! That is an incredibly intense situation.<br/><br/>I wasn't clear from your post on whether you, the player, found it an enjoyable horrific experience, or if it was just awful. In the latter case, I'd call it a clear Social Contract / Lines and Veils issue. If the former, however, I think this is a great example of a rather rare kind of "Story Now" horrific experience. My questions assume it was enjoyable, so if not, feel free to ignore them. If someone else has had an enjoyable horrific experience such as this, do feel free to comment.<br/><br/>Linked to the question above, what word would you use to describe the type of horror you felt? Panic? Incredulity? Disgust?<br/><br/>What do you think it was that caused a sensation of "horror" rather than "disgust" (or similar)? I mean, if the setup bothered you, what caused you to externalize it as good horror fiction which you were presently experiencing, rather than recognizing that you and your friend just made up this awful thing? And that all you had to do to make the "problem go away" would be to stop narrating things along those lines?<br/><br/>For that matter, this definitely sounds like a build-up - something caused your friend to determine he was possessing an adolescent boy rather than a fully grown woman. Something caused you to reveal having strangled your lover, instead of her dying in an accident. Something caused your friend to come at you with demands for carnal relations, rather than just spooky hauntings. What caused you to make these choices?<br/><br/>Did you get the feeling you were competing or collaborating to build horror and other intense emotional responses in the game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134535/#Comment_134535" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T04:02:27+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  4:02AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe the possessed boy was drawn from one of the four oracle cards. I think the other player decided the ghost lover part. It's part of IaWA to look for ways to put characters at odds using their "Best Interests."<br/><br/>My character was Zahir, a jaded gladiator who had the best interests "to yield to the temptation demon" and "to never kill again." I enjoyed the horror of build up in the scene, as the ghost lover approach and tried persuasion. I threw in the "don't make me kill you again" line and that was fun. But at that moment, I was acting, drawing up anger and fear and playing it (something I don't normally concentrate on in games -- I like author/director stance a lot). When the possessed boy sought embrace, my own personal dislike of the idea of sensual contact with an adolescent boy mixed with those emotions. I think I hit a level of discomfort and chose to draw the veil through character action. I had Zahir run away in horror. <br/><br/>I think that the fun horror was before that point, while I and the other player (Deke) were developing the scene. Zahir running away actually shortcircuited an opportunity to go farther. Previously, Zahir had promised a temptation demon he would kill the boy and I actually failed to remember that at the key moment. Deke said afterwards that that's what he was pushing towards.<br/><br/>Even so, what we played did have a lot of juice and addressed "Will Zahir kill again?" and "Will the ghost reunite with Zahir?" It felt like the middle of the story and that worked out fine.<br/><br/>I think that I did not enjoy that moment of disgust. But I might have acted differently if I had not in that moment been identifying with Zahir so deeply. It was a mixed experience for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134669/#Comment_134669" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T14:31:52+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  2:31PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see I didn't answer your questions.

I was aware that themes were coming together and being cool. I guess we played a scene that I identified as "horrific" but which did not horrify me. I only left the scene when the sex implications got to me.

So the game mechanics provide the competition which creates interesting situations, but the players still collaborate on creating setting and mood, did I get it right?<br/><br/>Do you think one could really "do horror" with IAWA? You said you were more disgusted than scared in the game you played. Let's say you could write a new Oracle with a horror theme focus, or decided to interpret an existing oracle with a horror theme. Would that be sufficient?<br/><br/>If I mention these two potential pitfalls, how would you address them, if at all?<br/><br/>#1: IAWA's power distribution is very even across GM and players. I'm phrasing pretty much the same question again (forgive me): can you experience horror in the in-game fiction when you know exactly by what (game) rules the horrific situations were created, you know they were just spontaneously made up by your friends around the table, and you may even have been a part of creating them?<br/><br/>#2: As I understand it, IAWA has no bounds on narration rights, until such time as when another player/character wishes to take issue with what your guy is up to. Your character cannot be a helpless, overpowered, outnumbered victim who doesn't have any idea what's going on. Or can she? Does IAWA support this in some way, or can this effect be created somehow without breaking the game? Alternatively, what other forms of horror can be created with IAWA?<br/><br/>(John, thanks - although for full disclosure, I have entirely selfish reasons)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134877/#Comment_134877" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T10:28:46+00:00" title="March 14, 2008 10:28AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2008 10:30AM by Alan.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mikael,<br/><br/>I see IaWA as a collaborative game rather than competitive. The players definately don't compete over anything and while the player characters can they don't have to. The best interests rule is about putting characters in conflict, which is not the same thing as competition.<br/><br/>IaWA also puts definate boundaries of narration. (Fairly traditional ones actually.) Players can only declare what their character does and feels, not what other characters do or feel. They can throw out background and setting suggestions, which are technically under the approval of the GM, but the GM usually just gives tacit approval. The GM also has the same sort of suggestive power for events in a PC's background, subject to player approval.<br/><br/>According to the rules, conflict happens when a <i>character</i> objects to another <i>character's</i> action. In discussions about the rules some people have found it useful to think in terms of player disagreements, however, this is only one function and lesser in importance than its main function.<br/><br/>I see the dicing system primarily as a means of identifying thematic moments. I as player don't always personally care which way the plot resolves, but I know that calling for a conflict will produce unexpected consqeuences that will give the ultimate direction more meaning.<br/><br/>This is why character's in IaWA <i>are</i> often helpless, overpowered, or outnumbered with no idea what's going on. They get into those states when the player loses a conflict and agrees to that state in lieu of taking a perminant reduction to their character's die sizes.<br/><br/>I left the first part of your questions for last, because I'm not clear what you mean by "do horror." Let me set out what I see in your words. By do horror, you mean have the players identify so closely with their characters that the player themselves experience feelings of fear and helplessness? <br/><br/>Let me know what you mean and I'll be happy to answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134946/#Comment_134946" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T14:12:02+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  2:12PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me clarify in less wishy-washy terms. Let it be known that my experiences all stem from loosely interpreted playtest versions of IAWA, so I may be a little off.<br/><br/>I guess I figure all RPGs as essentially collaborative, but IAWA expressly pits characters against each other, which makes me call it "competitive". You, the player, has to feel at least <i>some</i> form of victory (or glee) when you successfully undermine another character's Best Interest. Of course, you may also experience something similarly gratifying when someone's character does the same to yours. You may disagree with the term "competitive" - IAWA isn't the Roleplaying Olympics or anything - but in one sense, it's decidedly "not collaborative" on the character level. The characters are at odds, and while the players have the option of backing off at any time they recognize that the game is in that struggle.<br/><br/>I'm personally not a big fan of the concept of resolving player disagreements about fiction using system, except in situations so extreme there is no other recourse. In my view, such things shouldn't be the subject of competition, but collaboration. I guess that's where I see some really cool bits in IAWA - the collaboratively created and universally enjoyed fiction is built via this competition between characters, whose players have (at least partially) adopted their motivations.<br/><br/>IAWA has some boundaries of narration, but they're far less restrictive than those found in more traditional GM-led RPGs. In IAWA, as in Dogs and others, you narrate your character's actions in the instant they have succeeded, where in (say) Call of Cthulhu you'd narrate many actions as an attempted action right before it succeeded (or failed). There are some hidden terms in each narration, as follows:<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu: "I [try to] smack you across the face!"<br/>In a Wicked Age: "I smack you across the face [unless you would like to resist that]!"<br/><br/>The end result of that distinction is pretty powerful, I think.<br/><br/>Let me see if I can stop arguing semantics and get to the point.<br/><br/>Let's say I play a pure and true maiden, and you play a hulking slavering monster. By the rules of, say, GURPS, I would be at an incredible disadvantage. I as a player would feel it, too - the dread of this overpowering monster coming after me, thirsting for my blood, and there is little I can do to stop it. I'll have to use all my wits and resourcefulness, and the best I can hope for is probably going to be escaping you.<br/><br/>In IAWA, my maiden is no more powerless than your slavering beast. I can attempt to charm and pacify the monster, and your only advantage is another potential die for a Particular Strength. I am also less vulnerable - the most I can lose by is two dice levels of stats in a given contest, so I know I can take some risks without putting myself in an "instant death/lose" situation. As a result, I feel more <i>in control</i> of the narrative. Isn't this anathema to feelings of horror?<br/><br/>As to what horror is, that is tricky. When you watch a horror movie, you don't believe that you <i>are</i> the protagonist, but you tend to strongly empathize with her - "cheer for her", I guess. I'd claim that you do not get the "right" kinds of feelings if you watch a horror movie and hope for the protagonist to die a gruesome death, even though you did actually go to the theatre intentionally to watch horrible things and be frightened.<br/><br/>I think the same thing applies in an RPG. It doesn't have to be character identification, in an "actor stance" kind of way, but there has to be characters you empathize with and whose emotional state you can experience by proxy. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Given this definition, and the maiden/monster example above, how would you "do horror" in IAWA?<br/><br/>PS. I'm not picking on IAWA at all. Truth of the matter is, I have a game idea in the works with a similar premise to IAWA, in the sense that player characters are in opposition in various ways, and it's supposed to "do horror". Most of my pitfalls are ones other people have identified and which I'm trying to work out for myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135195/#Comment_135195" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T09:11:06+00:00" title="March 17, 2008  9:11AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Changed the topic to solicit responses from the general IaWA audience)<br/><br/>To reduce my question to its essentials: In IaWA, is it possible to create "horror play" - if even in the sense of a horror flick audience member - given that my maiden has as much control and power in the story as your monster?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135208/#Comment_135208" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T10:17:21+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 10:17AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2008 10:18AM by Alan.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "You, the player, has to feel at least some form of victory (or glee) when you successfully undermine another character's Best Interest.

I'm excluded from contributing and making things worse for my character. I think the second happens naturally, especially when players can trust the system not to screw them out of power to influence the game.<br/><br/>That said, trust is the key to all this. If a system mechanically removes power from a player but the player can trust that it will be returned later or in a differnt way, then the player may trust enough not to experience frustration during a period of unbalance. My Life with Master, I think, is a good example of this, where players are pressured by the system to obey that Master and do horrific things, until they collect enough Love to overthrow him.<br/><br/>So, yeah, games where the players recognize the horror of events and feel empathy for the characters is totally doable -- has already been done.<br/><br/>Games where the player actually feels powerless and fearfull themselves have definately been done too -- for 20+ years. It's one of the features I dislike about old school games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135217/#Comment_135217" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T11:23:59+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 11:23AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>I didn't see my job as player or GM to be undermining another player's Best Interest. I did not observe anyone else who behaved as if it were. I did feel great satisfaction when the Best Interests I chose generated cool story conflict. I did not chare whether I "won" or not, only that the story was generated.</blockquote>\nForgive me, I mean to say when you act against the Best Interest of a character whose Best Interest conflict with one of yours.<br/><br/>Although, by the sounds of it, we have been playing the game (as I mentioned, from a manuscript cobbled together from a combination of Arts, Grace &amp; Guts and random anyway blog posts) with more of an eye towards explicit character conflict than you. Maybe we played the game "wrong", I don't know. Regardless, if you don't mind, I'd like to leave this one by the wayside - whether I'm competing or not shouldn't make a difference to the horror content, should it?\n<blockquote>"you narrate your character's actions in the instant they have succeeded,"<br/><br/>I don't see how this is different from that oft declared "I cut his head off!" that I hear often when a player in DnD starts a fight. We all know he's got to go through the combat system to achieve that end, but he still says it.</blockquote>\nRight, but the implication is different - as I mentioned, the D&amp;D player is in effect saying "I [move to] cut his head off!", while in IaWA he's saying "I cut your head off [unless you want to challenge me for it]!". I think this makes a huge difference. If it doesn't in your game, please trust me when I say it does in mine.<br/><br/>You'll also note that unless I missed something very important, there are no static / environmental challenges in IaWA, as there is no task resolution <i>per se</i>. In D&amp;D, you might say "I try to leap the chasm" and let the dice determine the outcome. In IaWA, you say "I leap the chasm" or "I attempt to leap the chasm, but fail". Nobody but I get to say if I succeed, unless the chasm-jumping was part of a larger conflict between two named characters.<br/><br/>In my book, these combined translate into greater narrative control than what I enjoy in a more traditional RPG.\n<blockquote>RE: equality of power between PCs and NPCs. I think you're confusing feelings of powerlessness generated in the player with feelings of empathy for a character who is powerless. I find the former very frustrating.</blockquote>\nWell, no. I also find the former very frustrating. IaWA does not put opposing characters in a mechanically disadvantageous position relative to each other, whereas a game like Call of Cthulhu definitely does. Yet, the resources you as a player of IaWA has to work with are tied to the character - they are dice representing statistics (albeit non-traditional ones) and fictional resources. Compare Universalis, where the currency the player uses to tell the story is not tied to a particular character's ability at all.<br/><br/>Because of this tie to ability, in IaWA <i>characters</i> have more or less equal control of the situation. Yes, I as a player can pretend my maiden is not as powerful as your monster and may purposely put her in danger, but I know it to be a conscious decision. I have a hard time scaring myself by telling myself a scary story I just invented. My dilemma is that I know that horror can be reliably created if a character I empathize with is victimized, but I don't want to feel as though their fate is predetermined. Given the control the characters in IaWA enjoy, I have a hard time seeing them as victims.<br/><br/>The MLwM example is great. That may be a key approach to creating such effects in other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135230/#Comment_135230" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T12:40:13+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 12:40PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I would do it is not to have the monster (or monsters) as player characters. At most I would have them as NPCs. They can't go on the owe list, the game motivates characters to hit the monsters where the monsters are stronger than them, and you are likely to have a lot of injured and exhausted characters by the time the monsters get theirs. <br/><br/>I might not even have the monsters as NPCs, I would have them as things in the fictional environment whose actions could be negotiated as the result of various conflicts among the characters. This is, I think, the standard zombie movie setup, which is mainly about characters under pressure rather than zombies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135238/#Comment_135238" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T12:54:25+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 12:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I might not even have the monsters as NPCs, I would have them as things in the fictional environment whose actions could be negotiated as the result of various conflicts among the characters.
