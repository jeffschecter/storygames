The idea was that people would also promote <i>other people's</i> games. But nobody ever does.<br/><br/>So...to change that...<br/><br/>Over the weekend, I got the chance to play <a href="http://www.realms.co.uk/covenant/" rel="nofollow">Covenant</a>. I've wanted to play Covenant since <i>forever</i> and the game lived up to the anticipation.<br/><br/>Covenant has a superb setting. It's post-millennial: it's set in a world where everyone expected the apocalypse, but it didn't happen. And now they're wondering what they do with the beliefs they had before. And that's just...something new...that I haven't seen before. It's not sci-fi and it's not fantasy, although there's bits of both.<br/><br/>It's also a nasty, back-biting little game. In our game, it ran best when players worked against each other, and I love games like that. <br/><br/>Also, it has fun dice mechanics.<br/><br/>I really can't recommend Covenant enough. Perhaps it gets overlooked: the author doesn't shout about it much. But it's a great game and one that you feel has been playtested to <i>death</i>. It takes the best bits from other indie games and sort of makes them its own.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm going to bed now, and I'll post more about the convention I went to later. But Covenant was my best experience of the weekend and I really, really recommend you take a look at it.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you've got any questions, let me have them. Especially if they're directly about the game, because, honestly, I think it should be talked about more.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62176/#Comment_62176" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-26T13:57:16+00:00" title="March 26, 2007  1:57PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2007 1:57PM by Matt.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cheers Graham!<br/><br/>I must say, I really enjoyed running the game.

Trying to modify things to make it "easier for a con" can build in as many problems as it creates. <br/><br/>Simple things like whether the Conventions and Motifs undefined before play have a huge impact on engagement and player awareness of where they sit in the GM/Player relationship of the game. I know this, that's why I wrote them into the game, yet that nagging Con paranoia voice says things like "you won't have time, add a few yourself".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62330/#Comment_62330" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-28T03:31:48+00:00" title="March 28, 2007  3:31AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say let people create the Conventions and Motifs entirely themselves.

Is your AP a combined one on the 'death in Venice' game as a whole, or your experiences from one specific time you ran it? if you're concentrating on the overall experience, I'll just convert my AP notes into comments when you post your thoughts.

For example, although Dogs was an influence, the original resolution method goes back before that game was published, the influence is in the option to bow out of a conflict and lose even if you're winning.<br/><br/>Speed is definitely brisk. I wanted a game that would have a finite play time and pack in the awesome. So it's really designed to last three sessions and no more. A lot of the influence is from TV shows like 24, where it's all about the quick cutting and aggressive scene framing. Trying to get that phrenetic, "and then this goes wrong" thing in there.<br/><br/>Yeah, there is player scene framing, but only in specific circumstances. The real focus of the game is the protagonists deciding what they believe. They all start out with three deeply held beliefs, stated as those one-liners truisms you hear in conspiracy movies, stuff like "the ends justify the means". Things they held true, but are now in doubt. If, after a conflict, your character has made a final decision on which way he now feels about that, he gets some power to either shift things around mechanic wise or frame a new scene.<br/><br/>So, if your character has "Honour is all that matters", the GM frames scenes that put that honour on the line. Maybe you're character is forced to betray his friend to serve his faction. Maybe he holds firm. Either way could resolve that truism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62405/#Comment_62405" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T02:50:06+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  2:50AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cheers, Matt!
