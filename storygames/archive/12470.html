Four players. It was okay, but didn't rock our boat. Two main reasons:\xa0<br/><br/>1. Surprisingly, we don't seem to have the genre internalized, so we sort of didn't know what events would "naturally" follow each other - ended up going for too weird or original things because it was fun. Our little voodoo sidetrack ended up becoming the main plot, with sacrifices and supernatural events, because it just felt more natural for our group.<br/><br/>2. Why try to win? We did the dice competitions etc, and enjoyed them occasionally, but often forgot to transfer dice etc - and after a while it seemed pointless, because the story only seemed to advance when influence and investigation was successful. Did we miss something? Saying that someone didn't succeed just feels like a block.<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed reading the book. Playing the game was okay, but not really more than that, for us. <br/><br/>The part we liked the best was influencing others. Lots of fun making characters go against their own interests.<br/><br/>We sort of wished we'd played in English. Hard to get the feel without having the right tone, vocabulary.<br/><br/>Going for the black and white dice sometimes made for over-the-top scenes or characters that appeared to be mentally unstable. Fun, sometimes silly. I have a feeling we should have balanced the strong emotions more with a cool, calm exterior, but we didn't really manage that.\xa0\xa0\xa0                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280072/#Comment_280072" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T03:13:59+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  3:13AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>2.

In the games we played, where there were ties, we pretty much always ended up having the attempts succeed, as that was more fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280138/#Comment_280138" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T13:19:31+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  1:19PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad the game went OK.

I haven't seen voodoo in A Taste For Murder before.\n<blockquote>2. Why try to win?

For example, if someone proposes marriage and you reject them utterly, that's definitely, definitely not a block.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280265/#Comment_280265" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T05:21:58+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  5:21AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a responsibility, I think, for players to turn influences into ordeals. If I tell you that "you must fire the cook," and the attempt fails, I think it's up to the group to use that failure as a stepping stone for story. Perhaps there are new consequences for the cook being saved. All Influences are supposed to violate, so the rejection of an Influence places importance on the reverse decision. Perhaps the cook becomes the rejecting party's lover in the story, or brother, or some other thing.<br/><br/>I think it's worth taking a moment to consider a) how the 'block' polarises relationships and b) how the event can be intertwined with future Influence attempts (with this or other characters), perhaps even reversing the Influence (not only do you fail to get the cook sacked, but now I want you to propose to him).<br/><br/>Having said all that, I haven't played the game yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
