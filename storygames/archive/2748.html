I'll give you something to push Refresh about!<br/><br/><strong>Ryan Macklin's Friday</strong><br/>After a leisurely five-hour road trip, Justin (King Turnip) and I arrived to see Albert, Nancy &amp; Michael there.  We picked locations, set up tents, and that's when I dug out the gin.  That would become a recurring element during this trip, especially for me.<br/><br/>As others of our most freakin' AWESOME number arrived, we all got to do that "man, I haven't seen you in forever" thing that make me honestly wish that Sacramento, the Bay Area, and all of SoCal were so much closer together.  We hung out, ate food, and let the Eagle Scouts make with the fire.  It wasn't until maybe 9 or 10pm that we started breaking into gaming groups.<br/><br/>As so it was that on the first night, Christina, Nancy, Paul and I played what would be the first of our two-part Polaris game on one side of camp.  We sat on a bench bundled up on clothing, with just the light of the stars, the near-full moon and a single lantern to play by.  (Paul has spoken  about it some on his blog, <a href="http://afistfulofgames.blogspot.com/2007/04/nerdliest-place-on-earth.html" rel="nofollow">http://afistfulofgames.blogspot.com/2007/04/nerdliest-place-on-earth.html</a> )  There's something about the way we, being cold and telling stories over camplight, make the game feel truly amazing.  When Christina was having her Heart's scene with the Solaris Knight, her Mistaken (Nancy) say that with every word the room grew colder.  This prompted Paul and I, as the Moons, to stand up and continually exhale deeply around them, our breath turning into fog, adding such an amazing atmosphere to the scene.<br/><br/>There was a Dogs in the Vineyard game on the other side of camp that also started that night and continued on Saturday night, but that is not for me to talk about aside from that it sounded like something truly righteous.  I hope to read more about that here.<br/><br/>The two games started breaking down between 2:30 &amp; 3am -- I think with the Dogs game pausing first, making us realize what time it was.  I stayed up a bit longer around the fire, thinking the amazing experience I just had playing Polaris -- immediately making it leap to be on my "favorite games" list.<br/><br/>On Saturday, I started gaming around 8am I think, and ended around 3am Sunday.  But that, I fear, is another post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62824/#Comment_62824" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T14:31:45+00:00" title="April  3, 2007  2:31PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2007 2:52PM by Josh Roby.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I illustrate:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://nerdlybeachparty.org/images/b/bd/Drunken_Polaris.JPG" width="500"/><br/><br/>And more available on the <a href="http://nerdlybeachparty.org/index.php?title=Photos" rel="nofollow">Photos Page</a>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip" title="King Turnip"><img alt="King Turnip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip">King Turnip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62830/#Comment_62830" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T15:09:22+00:00" title="April  3, 2007  3:09PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still under the watchful eye of my boss, so if anyone asks, I was writing "no message call" over and over.<br/><br/>Ryan and I did share the painful anticipation of driving from Sac-Town.  The left coast has some beautiful views, but unfortunately, they aren't on I-5.  On the up-side, we didn't have to drive through San Francisco at rush hour.<br/><br/>The two-part Dogs game on Friday brought the hardcore as well.  Run by Joshua Bishop-Roby for me, Ed, Ted, Laura and Michael it began with what I take it is typical Dogs-core.  Pushing, escalating and reaching a little too far to get what we needed.  For me, the scene that really brought it was when I tossed in to try and save the villains lackey that had been shot three times in the chest.  I managed to save her, but pulled down so much fallout that I ended up with an injury-- a common theme throughout the game.  "I done healed her too hard and blown me a rotator cuff."  Rather than a physical injury, we went with shell shock:  this was my first confirmed kill, and I was spiritually wounded.  It took Michael's Sister Rahiel to bring my poor orphan back from a spiral of despair and misery.<br/><br/>The whole experience was a caliber above my normal game group, and the retreat has really recharged my bateries.

I emerged from my tent around 6:30am and properly woke up an hour or so later.  Justin was up early as well, so we talked and I asked if he'd like to try my Game Chef game, "Know Thyself."  I brought a copy of the manuscript with me, though only one character sheet (as I brought it to talk about it with Paul on an episode of Master Plan, not necessarily to playtest).<br/><br/>I was scheduled to run a game of <em>Spirit of the Century</em> that morning, but not all the participants were awake, and truthfully I'm not sure how well I could have run a SOTC game right then.  But then I almost always think that about GMing.  I digress.<br/><br/>Justin and I started with a one-player game of KT, where I taught him the basics of the rules and the premise of the game.  As people woke up and checked out the game, I collected more players rather quickly:  Albert &amp; Nancy, then Ted &amp; Christina, and finally Michael.  So, I got some interesting feedback from the perspective of a one-player game and a six-player game, as my previous playtest was with two players.  The game didn't work well with more players or with only one player, but it seemed like fun was had <em>overall</em> and I was pleased <em>enough</em> with the end result that I considered that session a qualified success.  I mean, in the end I had Death, Liberty, and the King of the Damned as characters, and I had that regained a memory of losing <em>Europe</em> in some sort of card game.<br/><br/>But if I talk more about that, this'll end up a Game Chef entry.  Next on my agenda was JBR's <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> game.  He ran it, and we had Meghan, Paul, Ted, Nancy, Albert and myself in the game.  Meghan's character had some very steamy duplicitous action going on.  Paul played a green flyboy damned well ("I'm Hans M\xfcller!").  Ted's drunken gadgeteering &amp; snooping about was highly entertaining, especially as he and Meghan played off one another.  Nancy's very..British..commander had some choice lines and played off of Paul's green flyboy and my surly armed bitch fantastically well.  Albert was entertaining as a rake and a powerful player as an investigator.  Joshua's GMing was smooth and very enjoyable.  I was in a group of giants.<br/><br/>I learned one major thing in that game:  how to phrase what I want to offer.  Late in that game, when Paul, Meghan and Ted were in the flying lorry that was quickly disintegrating, trying to board the giant disco ball trolley that the rest of the characters were in, I asked "Do the windows open?"  Joshua said "sure!" to which I responded "How about if they don't?"  He got that I wanted to shoot out the windows, but the problem what that I didn't articulate what I actually wanted to offer -- something I knew I needed to work on better, and was finally able to put a finger on with that fame.  So there you have it:  people learn stuff at the Nerdly Beach Party.<br/><br/>Also, scripts in <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> are freakin' badass, but there will be more on that in a future Master Plan episode.  But now I'm jumping ahead to Sunday.<br/><br/>Alas, I must log off now and run errands.  And so it was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62846/#Comment_62846" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T17:07:27+00:00" title="April  3, 2007  5:07PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm Hans Mueller!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62847/#Comment_62847" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T17:24:59+00:00" title="April  3, 2007  5:24PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm Hans Mueller!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip" title="King Turnip"><img alt="King Turnip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip">King Turnip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62849/#Comment_62849" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T17:34:15+00:00" title="April  3, 2007  5:34PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jessie's Sorceror game on Saturday rocked out.  Laura, Michael, Ed and myself took a great scenario in directions that would have broken the less hippie-minded.<br/><br/>A small village in Germany, locked in fifteen years of winter after the rightful baron was overthrown.  Disappearing villagers, gods and monsters wandering the forest, rumors that the baron wasn't really dead.  The table was set for Awesome.  The characters were an Exorcist-turned-Village priest, the rightful heir to the barony, the half-human son of the Goddess of the Forest, a French rebel and revolutionary (read: mercenary and brigand) gone old.<br/><br/>Michael started off the hardcore, rescuing some woman-- the usurper's daughter-- from kidnappers.  His first instinct it to turn the situation to profit, and Jessie's roleplay of the girl deflating as she realized that her situation has not really changed was priceless.  My priest is off after a missing confessor, and I enlist the aid of Ed's godling and Laura's noble orphan.  All signs of malfesance point to the aptly named usurper Baron Webstrom.<br/>As the plot unfolds, the rightful ruler is not really dead, but is a sorceror.  Michael switched sides at the drop of a hat or the price of a decent meal.  I chastized, rebuked and was nearly killed by the Goddess of Winter.  The rightful rulers were restored and the family reunited.  The vile Webstroms were killed in an awesome Tarrantino climax by Ed and Laura.<br/><br/>The highlight reel would include:<br/>Michael's aforementioned counter-kidnapping.<br/>The showdown between the Goddess of Winter and the sputtering-mad Exorcist, with the Noble Orphan trying to pull them apart as she had a dim inkling that the Goddess was possessing her thought-to-be-dead mother.<br/>The Godling's confrontation with his Goddess-Mother, requesting permission to kill the Webstroms to spite his sister.<br/>The Noble Orphan's final climactic confrontation with the man that had "killed" her.  "*cough* I'm not long for this world,"  "You're right, you're not." *BANG*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62911/#Comment_62911" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T09:56:08+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  9:56AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More pictures can be found <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83606028@N00/tags/nerdly/" rel="nofollow">here</a>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62916/#Comment_62916" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T10:26:16+00:00" title="April  4, 2007 10:26AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got any extra Owlbear shirts laying around?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62927/#Comment_62927" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T11:01:10+00:00" title="April  4, 2007 11:01AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2007 11:01AM by Remi.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't mean to pat myself on the back, but those shirts came out pretty well!
