Recently, I read something on here about LotFP which makes me think it'd be a good mix. Here's the problem: I've yet to read a good review of LotFP that tells me what makes it stand out from the crowd, but I've heard reports that it allows you to make unique monsters and customize them to the adventures. Is this accurate, and how good of a job does it do? <br/><br/>Alternatively, does anyone have suggestions for how to create unique monsters for a fantasy version of Stalker, perhaps something a bit more in-depth than the basic rules?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368474/#Comment_368474" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T11:09:47+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 11:09AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2012 11:10AM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I helped edit the book so I kinda hope I can be relied on to know what I'm talking about)<br/><br/>LotFP has advice but no strict procedures on monster making<br/><br/>It is very much like a D&amp;D retroclone but one of the differences is there's no monster list.<br/><br/>The most important rules difference between LOTFP and the versions of basic D&amp;D which it resembles is that it slices out some of the math-bloat involved in making properly "levelled" monsters so it's easier to make monsters with the right numbers. Like all basic versions of D&amp;D, there are very few numbers to worry about.<br/><br/>Other things that make LOTFP unlike other D&amp;D retroclones: the spell descriptions (of mostly the same standard spells) are more surreal and horror-centric, the artwork is extremely goremetal, the default setting is a few centuries later (there's no effect on the rules and the setting is not described in detail, it's just "pilgrim era"), there is a lot of (pretty good) GMing advice and how-to-play instructions, the rogue/thief/specialist skill system is simple and effective, the encumbrance system is simple and effective.<br/><br/>If you are used to basic D&amp;D and its clones you will find it in many ways indistinguishable in play. People have characters move from D&amp;D to Swords &amp; Wizardry to Labyrinth Lord to LOTFP and back again all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368476/#Comment_368476" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T11:14:24+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 11:14AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LotFP is mechanically nigh-identical with red box D&amp;D. It "allows" you to create monsters just like D&amp;D does. A very clean thing, though, and playable: if you don't have any version of old basic D&amp;D, LotFP is a perfectly reasonable choice.<br/><br/>I would play something like this with the Stalker rules-system, though. I don't think it needs anything too far-fetched to enable fantastic monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368517/#Comment_368517" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T14:23:23+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  2:23PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero: That's what I thought (playing it with the Stalker system), but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something. <br/><br/>Zak S.: Thank you.
