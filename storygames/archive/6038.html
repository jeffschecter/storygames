Our heroes included Peter (who posts here time to time) and Berin (the redoubtable <a href="http://www.unclebear.com" rel="nofollow">Uncle Bear</a>, who does not live with a crack team of commando supermodel font designers despite what you might have thought if you've been a fan of his website for a long time like I have.)<br/><br/>I used the <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Vista_Heights_Oracle" rel="nofollow">Vista Heights Oracle</a>, an Oracle of my own creation.<br/><br/>I have to confess, I'm not a big sword and sorcery fan.  Indeed, the things I love about D&amp;D have never been sword-and-sorcery-ish in the sense of the literary (sub?)genre.  So the original Oracles never really pushed my buttons. What I liked about the originals, and what Vista Heights still needs work on, was that they were evocative and inherently contained things people would want, would do to each other, and so on.  <br/><br/>We had two players and my own self as GM. Here's what we drew for the first chapter:<br/><br/>A former cop, outspoken about problems in the Department, embarassing his old friends.<br/>A rookie IA cop thinks he can change things while resenting that he had to rat on a fellow officer to join the squad.<br/>The defense lawyer never came close to falling in love with a client before.<br/>The drugs are wrapped with duct tape and buried in a grocery bag of kids' clothes<br/><br/>The players picked the former cop and the client of the defense lawyer, also a former cop, to be the characters.  The former cop activist was Korean-American Nick Park, who had the particular strength of Ties To A Powerful Politician, and whose best interests were to prove the defendant's corruption and get the IA officer on his side.  The former cop defendant was Michael Negroponte, whose particular strength was a set of criminal contacts and his best interests involved discrediting the IA cop and silencing Nick<br/><br/>As you may recall, I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5452#Item_6" rel="nofollow">have had a devil of a time</a> figuring out how many NPCs to pick off the ridiculously huge list of elements and characters that I brainstorm with the players.  I arbitrarily limited myself to 3: Helena Turner, the defense lawyer (best interests: get Michael to murder her husband, control the powerful politician), Marcia Jefferson, a housing projects drug dealer Fagin (best interests: persuade Nick to publicize her case, see Michael convicted for his crime), Joey Seymour, the IA cop, (best interests: get Nick to run for city council, make his arrest of Michael stick) with the Particular Strength of IA Immunity for shady dealings.<br/><br/>The first chapter spluttered a couple of times until I realized something very important about this game.  Rising action is not handled as well as confrontation, or at least not in the same way as so many other resolution systems (conflict or task or whatever it is we're calling it this week). You can pace a conflict within the back-and-forth of move and answer rather than try to pace out a mystery or thriller where you have little confrontations, peel away this layer or that layer, and then have a big scene.  You don't need to, the whole shebang is one unified thing.  <br/><br/>In one of the first conflicts (does Michael go to jail at the arraignment), I introduced them to "you go to jail (roll roll), ha I win, you can go to jail or you can be exhausted. Okay, you're exhausted? You go to jail (roll, roll), ha I win, you can go to jail or you can be exhausted.  Okay, you're exhausted? You go to jail (roll, roll), ha I win..." Eventually I had worn him down so much that it didn't matter whether he was in jail or not. I got what I wanted - him in a vulnerable position for being framed or whatnot.<br/><br/>What was cool about the story generated in this chapter was that both player characters were utterly ruthless in pursuing their goals The former cop activist saw nothing wrong with partnering with Marcia the evil drug dealer who probably was responsible for the crimes Michael was accused of, in order to "bring down someone in blue for this".   And the former cop defendant ended up hiring a hitman to take out the activist (and he did take him out).  This may be a function of convention play ("might as well, I'm not going to see this guy again") of course. But it was still neat.<br/><br/>The second chapter included Michael and the following elements:<br/><br/>"Holy shit, he's wearing a fucking wire!"<br/>Thousands of dollars in cocaine, but it could be poison<br/>The shades are pulled, foil over the windows, towels under the doors<br/>He waits for his ride, everything he needs to make a meth lab in one suitcase<br/><br/>Peter played Michael again.  Berin switched to "Ivan", a street chemist whose Particular Strength, very well used in this chapter, was "Friggin' Genius".  Joey, Nick and Marcia all made returns as we decided this chapter happened chronologically right before the first chapter.  Joey was a rookie undercover officer, Nick a veteran wearing a wire as they infiltrated Marcia's organization.  Michael (may have) decided to take down Marcia by framing her for putting a bunch of poisoned cocaine on the streets.  We didn't have as much time to play this one, so it quickly became an apocalyptic showdown between Ivan and Michael over the poisoned cocaine, with Nick carted off in an ambulance after a meth lab explosion (explaining why he was not in the Department in the first chapter), and Joey becoming determined to take Michael down, but being frozen out by Department politics (Michael's new Particular Strength).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135113/#Comment_135113" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T13:25:40+00:00" title="March 16, 2008  1:25PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few more thoughts on pacing. What it helps to do is to spring right for the top: "He shoots her." and then, if you feel like you've established what you need to establish (anything from "he wants to shoot her" to "she's nearly dead"), to give and offer that to the other side as an in-fiction consequence.  And what helps this is having best interests that target the hell out of each other.

The best interests character generation step is what really drives it, and getting that right, interesting and compelling will keep the game moving.  I think being a fan of the genre your situation is generated in helps. When I played previous with the actual shipped-with Oracles, it was okay, but I shrugged my shoulders a lot and went "there's...a magic...thing...I guess..." in a mumblety voice.  The game was a lot better for me (and I think for any group I GM) because I love people shooting each other in the back, stealing money and dealing drugs. I gotta ask you. If Snot Boogie stole the money every week, why'd you let him play? You got to man.

So I decided to play up the corruption to hilt, with Michael still meaning to do good under it all, but willing to use any means at his disposal (including assassination and poison) to achieve his goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BerinKinsman" title="BerinKinsman"><img alt="BerinKinsman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BerinKinsman">BerinKinsman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135609/#Comment_135609" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T21:39:53+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  9:39PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second Peter's take on ruthlessness. My first character started out trying to be a nice guy, an ex-cop looking to xpose corruption. Part way in, I realized it was more fun to have his motives less pure, that he really wanted to take down a cop to demonstrate to "the people" that the city wasn't going to go easy on corrupt cops and he was going to hang a cop out to dry at any cost to further his own political career. The reason I let him die was because I really didn't know where to take him if he did manage to survive. I also wanted to see how the system handled coming into the second chapter with a completely new character. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Ivan I went balls-to-the-wall villain because I had nothing to lose. If it were an ongoing campaign I might have played him differently to keep him in the game, but that that point I knew that it would be over in about 90 minutes and there wouldn't be a chapter 3, so I just pulled out the stops. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe system worked really well for a dirty cop drama.
