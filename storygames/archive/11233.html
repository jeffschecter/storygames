It's actually a fun game with a really precise Initiative mechanic allowing for intense sword duel.

The game at the link was the first draft/24 hour RPG version of the game from 2003.  The most recent version of the game has since added and changed a lot, but you'd have to contact the author, Michael P. O'Sullivan to get a playtest copy.  I've played it at a con with him, and have run it myself and it is a fun game with a wonderful core mechanic that really fits the feel of the genre.  Try it and then encourage him to finish it!<br/><br/>I'm psyched to see <a href="http://ericjboyddesigns.com/HouseofCards.aspx" rel="nofollow">House of Cards</a> finish development as well.<br/><br/>And then there's always <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow">GHOST/ECHO</a>.

If anyone is interested in the game, just send me an email at mposullivan1978 at gmail dot com and I'll be more than happy to email you a PDF of it.  I'm in a period of questioning whether I should bring the game to publication, but there is a complete game here if people want to have a look.  <br/><br/>I've had the chance to look at House of Cards but haven't played it yet, and I can highly recommend it.  It has a great eye for the procedure of heist films, something that also inspired my stuff with Criminal Element, but takes it down a more "story game" path.  Really, really smart design.  Eric killed it.  <br/><br/>I have played Fiasco though, and can totally recommend that game as well.  It's not expressly about thieves, but about people that are morally... corrupt is probably the best way to put it.  It's not so much about the crime itself but the reasons that people commit their crimes and the terrible bloody outcomes.  Really fun game.  <br/><br/>If you're looking for more of a caper style game (i.e.: The Ocean's movies, Lock Stock, etc.), then I would actually recommend using Spirit of the Century.  All of the various mechanics of that game line up perfectly with running a fun crime romp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250198/#Comment_250198" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-10T00:29:03+00:00" title="January 10, 2010 12:29AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, in Thief: Deadly Shadows, Garrett is equipped with special thieving equipment.  He has elemental arrows (not of a damaging nature), a little spy camera ball he can throw, a sap and a sword.<br/><br/>In Thief you have about 4 hits worth of  "HP" and no way to defend yourself (you can attack with your sword, but only cleverly jumping behind obstacles will stop you from taking hits).  This really forces you to focus on not being discovered or running away and hiding if you are.  <br/><br/>There are different obstacles which you must overcome with your own special tools. Guards must be snuck past, or you must carefully sneak up on them and sap them.  Unaware enemies go down faster than aware enemies. There are soft floors (grass, carpet) which are easy to sneak on and hard floors (marble) which must be traveled carefully lest you make too much noise.  You can use your precious few moss arrows to make any floor soft. You have "Rope arrows" that create a rope for you to climb wherever you shoot them. You can get to balconies this way or even make a hidey hole. If you are forced to kill a guard, they leave a pool of blood that can be discovered.  You can use water arrows to wash it away.  Water arrows can also put out torches which lets you sneak easier.<br/><br/>There is a lot of exploration in Thief. In fact, I'd say it's all about exploration. After all, the next room might have a safe full of precious loot. Also, the environment tells you a lot and eventually delivers the story. In Thief, you always end up getting pulled into the intrigue of a group called the Keepers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250199/#Comment_250199" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-10T01:22:08+00:00" title="January 10, 2010  1:22AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shadowrun, Cyberpunk 2020, GURPS Cyberpunk and pretty much every other cyberpunk-semi-related game out there seems to put the characters in the role of thieves on a semi-regular basis, pulling off heists, often in the most violent way possible.
