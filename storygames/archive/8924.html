Sorry if that disconnects some of the discussion below.]<br/><br/>I ran some Burning Empires games and a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8741&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Story Games Lounge at Genghis Con</a> last month, and felt like I was occasionally up against the expectation that as a GM I'm the one who needed to be entertaining everyone. True, I was running the lounge and it was my responsibility to make sure fun games were available and to teach the various systems (but there were a couple of others who facilitated games there too). But this expectation doesn't work with many story games where players need to be extremely proactive and highly engaged in the game.<br/><br/>So the question is, beyond just getting people to play enough Story Games to "get it", what can be done to change that kind of faulty perception at the start? I'd like to be able to say some magic words or give someone a sheet of paper to read that will dispel this notion and make it clear that the GM isn't special here (if there even is one). In fact, there's a lot of things I'd probably want to put on that paper to let folks know (in a non-confrontational way) that certain things are different in Story Games. Certain ingrained principles and perceptions don't apply here and, in fact, some other ideas do.<br/><br/>So, seriously, I'm looking for a list or brainstorming on ways to do that, ways that have worked for you, ideas I haven't considered and should, etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197045/#Comment_197045" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T17:29:37+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  5:29PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were going to start a nonprofit organization to tackle the ills of the world, it would be some environmental cause.<br/><br/>If I were going to start a NPO to tackle the ills of the gaming world, it would be to eliminate the idea that the GM is supposed to "entertain." And since this really my banner to fly above my game table, let me explain at least where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>TV and Movies "entertain." They don't provide TOOLS for me to entertain myself, they entertain me, so I can passively sit back and "enjoy the show." Books engage and force me to think and are a different catagory.<br/><br/>This does not mean games can't be <i>fun</i> and that people can't be <i>entertained</i> by their gaming experience. But unless a gaming session is going to cost money or be interrupted by commercials for snacks, players probably shouldn't be allowed to enjoy the fruits of someone else's labors without bringing something to the table.<br/><br/>It really is as simple as that. The key of course is more games with zero-prep that bring the players into the design of the "environment." Enough indie games are doing this, so I'm not sure how much weight this carries on this website. Most gamers looking for "more" already know that waiting for the mission to be revealed is no where near as fun as making the mission yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197046/#Comment_197046" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T17:36:06+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  5:36PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Jim, how do you communicate that to new players at your table?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197048/#Comment_197048" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T17:39:32+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  5:39PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's down to the games.

I guess I'm pretty ingrained here too. I like to be fun at any game I'm in regardless of whether I'm the GM or not.

The first poster was rather clear about what he did mean with "GM as Entertainer": The GM prepare a show, then he goes to play it in front of a really passive group of players who are there only to be "entertained" by him.  It's a style of playing that a lot of people take for granted, for example in the first groups I played in, and it's the reason a lot of GM get fed up with gaming (right before I stopped playing like this, leaving behind the old group because they expected this kind of "service" as their right because "it's the way rpgs are played", I likened it to people expecting to relax in the chair with the GM massaging their Ego (and I didn't really use the word "massaging") ). It has NOTHING to do with the mutual expectation that people will entertain each other when they play.<br/><br/>About the question: I don't know how you can change people's perceptions, I found easier to change group. But in any case, if you don't like to GM that way, you owe to yourself to stop. Just say no.

No new and cool way of naming the GM job has worked.  As an aside, I want to point out that the only one to have worked at all was renaming the DM to the GM to remove the tendency to identify the term with a single product.</li>\n<li>Blurbs in games do not tend to help, as one of the perceived duties of the GM for lazy, passive characters is to larn all the rules and just teach it to the players as they play.  Also, the tend to be skipped by anyone who doesn't feel they need to read the "training wheels" sections of the game text.</li>\n<li>It is the GM's job to entertain the players, just as it is any player's job to also do the same.  The GM is a player, after all, and every player bears responsibility for bringing the fun.</li>\n</ol>\nAll of that said, I think the best way to handle it is to say it explicitly, upfront each session until you know it is being heard.  If you have a passive player who is not getting the fun, then you can't let that ruin your fun or the other player's fun.  If you are upfront each session, you can simply reply to the complaint that you know it has to suck for them - since they aren't bringing the same "A Game" everyone else is (and thus not having the same fun).  It now falls to them to rise to the occasion or identify for themselves that the active-play game style is not for them.<br/><br/>I used to have the same concept about GMs we are discussing.  I worked my ass off to entertain my players - and seemed to do so for quite some time, but there would always come a point where I recognized that it wasn't fun for me.  I would blame the game or the setting and move to the next game.  I got a rep for killing games.  I was miserable.<br/><br/>Nowadays, I play better, to the standards I want to play and consequentially, I play less.  I love GMing, but I do very little of it of late.  Nowadays, I spend much more time on the other side of the screen where someone else has the de-facto powers given the GM.  When I am just a player (if such a thing is possible), I try and play like I wish people would play my games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197069/#Comment_197069" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T18:34:33+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  6:34PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Seriously.

I might be fun and having fun, but I'm not running the show. For instance, when I run a PTA pitch session at a con I hardly ever contribute my own ideas. And when we frame scenes in WGP I try not to even be in the first few. So I guess I need to find a balance or a line between teaching the game system and being the ring master.<br/><br/>But I'm not talking about a situation where I can pick my players - I'm running at cons! (My home games are going great, no perception issues there!) I think that's where I may not be clearly communicating in this thread. When someone walks into a Story Games Lounge and is walking - literally - right out of the culture of "GMs should entertain me" what can I say to set different expectations for that player for the games they are about to play? <br/><br/>I think jim has a good start with, "without goals or some active stake in the game world [you] won't have much to do".

But if they said the latter, they'd sound petty and would immediately be besieged by anecdotes about players who don't sit there like lumps, because the reason why RPGs work and why we all keep coming back to play them is because boring lump-like players are not actually as universally common as this sort of complaint makes it sound.  If they were, no one posting here would have ever bothered to play more than one session of anything, and certainly wouldn't be interested enough in RPGs to bother reading a forum about them.<br/><br/>Not that I'm saying you shouldn't bitch about bad, unengaging players.  You absolutely should, they kill games just as much as bad, unengaging GMs do.  It's good to bitch about that sort of thing, it relieves stress and makes you appreciate your good games that much more.  It's better, I think, if you come right out and say that you're going to be bitching about bad players or bad GMs -- because that kind of bitching is not being petty, it's telling the truth.  Telling horror stories and sharing complaints are part of how we teach each other what works and what doesn't.<br/><br/><br/>I tend to think that JuddG has said everything that needs to be said on how to address this above, but...well, knowing how to address this issue has never and likely will never stop this discussion from repeating itself.  Because yes, we all know that stating expectations up front is always a good thing to do, and we can all grasp the concept that everyone in the game ought to be entertaining everyone else in the game.  It's true, it works, we all can recognize the importance of it.  Unfortunately, the itch that drives these threads is unscratchable by mere logic, perceptiveness, and good ideas: so oh well, here we go again.  ("The GM shouldn't be an entertainer, this is a bad concept that needs to be eradicated."  "Actually, I like being an entertaining GM, and I like GMs who are entertaining."  "YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT, SHUT UP."  Sheesh.)<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite>But for PTA and "With Great Power..." the role is different but the expectations are the same - even calling it "Producer" doesn't help, they saw through that lame trick back in the early 90s.</blockquote>\nIsn't PTA a poor example for this?  If the Producer isn't acting as an entertainer in the sense of attempting to engage the players and to draw in players who aren't being engaged, the game fails just as hard as any "traditional" RPG would.  A Producer who doesn't work to keep the game moving is deadly, even when the players are all engaged.  (And yes, the players have to work, too, but the Producer's role absolutely must involve being an entertainer in order for the game to be its best.  PTA is pretty close to the "trad" end of gaming: the GM's role there is very nearly as strong and central as it would be in, say, your typical nWoD game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197080/#Comment_197080" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T20:57:18+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  8:57PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2009 8:58PM by jim pinto.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Because yes, we all know that stating expectations up front is always a good thing to do, and we can all grasp the concept that everyone in the game ought to be entertaining everyone else in the game.</blockquote>\nAs we all know, chiming in and saying I'm not going to chime in is the best post of all.<br/><br/>My apologizes to everyone about bringing this topic up again.

That takes a very high level of player engagement. Since I'm always running pitch sessions and pilot episodes, I can usually get that.

It sounds impossible on the face of it: depending on your audience, you may or may not have to explain different things.  The best you can do, I think, is to identify for yourself what you think the most vital concepts and expectations are (which will no doubt vary from game system to game system -- what Burning Empires needs is not necessarily what PTA needs, which is not necessarily what IAWA needs), so that you can explain them to whoever is showing up to play and make sure that they're on the same page as you.<br/><br/>So maybe that's the first step in "Just Say It":  know what absolutely, positively needs to be understood in order for the game to work.  The second step would then be to, um, say it.  Or rather, to SELL it: to be as entertaining as you normally are when pitching anything else, to do your level best to promote the idea that everyone who gets on board with these expectations will have an amazing time.  If you think someone isn't understanding a vital point, stay with them and help them understand it, just like JuddG said above.<br/><br/>And if the sale isn't going through (they don't get it, or they don't like it, or whatever), you should probably be willing to say, "Okay, well, it's not for everyone, there's plenty of other things we can do that are fun" and save the expectation-challenging for another group at another time.  Or perhaps under some circumstances and with some games, it might be possible to tolerate an overly passive player and not let it ruin your or anyone else's fun, in which case you can go ahead and just accept that one guy isn't going to connect with the game the way the rest of you do.  (Edit: the weird thing is, this is one area where I really do believe that "GM as entertainer" causes problems -- if you GM a lot of games and work hard to keep players engaged, it is really painful and incredibly difficult to step back and say "Okay, so, he doesn't get it, and I can't make him get it."  I'm always aching to find some way to pull that disconnected guy back in, even when I know that I can't!)<br/><br/><br/>Maybe people could share ways that they've successfully introduced and run specific games?  It wouldn't be the magic bullet universal elevator pitch you're looking for, but it might give you some useful ideas and references for "just saying it" in your own words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197099/#Comment_197099" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T22:43:54+00:00" title="March 15, 2009 10:43PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim played in an IaWA game I ran at a recent con that went rather well.

I was bred on D&amp;D and we played lots of sandbox games where you could just decide to go left and the DM had to roll with it.<br/><br/>The thing is D&amp;D lacks certain tools that can help in this regard, like beliefs or goals that are hardwired into the character from the get go (a la Burning Wheel), or a collaborative world building session so everyone knows how you tie into the setting and situation, or a mechanic for players to share narrative control. These things can feel really different and players that are not used to them can take a bit of coaxing and friendly coercion.

The set-up was slow (you were teaching five people a new game) and the concept wasn't groking with everyone.<br/><br/>And then, BAM! The game took off. No one at that table can say they didn't have fun. No one there could complain about the outcomes, either.

Draw a card, black cards are in a scene together. Red cards are in a scene together.

It is pointless to say to a player or group "Its not my job to run everything for you, this game is different," mostly because every GM/RPG says that in its own way.<br/>\n  "I am different" is the mantra of GMing and RPG design.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Its more important to SHOW that difference. Slow the mechanics down in the beginning and stop and highlight what you are rolling for and what the roll means, if it is different in this system. When I was running Shadow of Yesterday, the players that had the most old school RPG experience were the ones that were the hardest to get Intent out of. Their answers were always task-related, and never spoke to what the character's Intent was. But, it is hard to "break that habit" until the Intent matters to the player. Once I got them in a roll where it mattered if they succeeded or failed, I mean personally mattered, then it was a lot easier to hash out what the roll meant and what the player was rolling for.<br/>\n  The trouble is, that takes time to hash out and the less you know about the player behind the dice, the longer it will take to reach that point where you can find that one roll that the player is really invested in.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Once it happens, you have to recognize, then go in super slow-mo until you can get the player to understand what you are saying.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope that helps.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197178/#Comment_197178" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T09:32:46+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  9:32AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>And this session was a perfect example of a nearly GM-less game.</blockquote>IAWA does a good job of setting expectations - it's impossible to assume that the GM has a preconceived idea of what's going to happen.<br/><br/>I apologize now, but I do not understand your point.

Could you expand your post?<br/><br/>The thing about In a Wicked Age is that the GM is there more as a facilitator than as an entertainer.  The group as a whole defines the setting and situation through the use of the Oracles, and then define their characters' best interests in order to create conflicts.  The GM just sets the scene and pretty much says "go!"  Because the characters already have motivations and best interests, the GM doesn't need to worry about creating a story (nor could he possibly have an idea as to what the players might do), as the story will be emergent through the players actions.  Part of this is because IAWA focuses on player vs. player interaction.  Most of the time, the players aren't working together, and are actually acting at cross-purposes. <br/><br/>This is opposed to something like D&amp;D, where, usually, the players are part of a team, acting against whatever opposition the GM comes up with.  This is where the idea of "GM as entertainer" arises from.  In D&amp;D (and other "traditional" games), you need the GM to create the elements that form the story (conflicts).  In games like IAWA, it's the players that create the conflicts, and therefore the GMs role is highly diminished.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197188/#Comment_197188" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T10:50:28+00:00" title="March 16, 2009 10:50AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2009 10:57AM by Ry.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>I apologize now, but I do not understand your point.

The GM has done an ambiguous amount of work, there's something he's got behind the curtain.  So the players naturally sit down, and wait for the hook.  Narrative players are looking to help the GM's story, exploration players are looking to find the secrets, gamie players want to beat the GM's monsters.  But in every case, there's this implicit assumption that the GM has done work behind the scenes (story writing, environment making, encounter building).  How much?  Well, we'll have to find out through play.  But really, it's a world that the GM has behind the curtain, and it will only be imperfectly revealed to the players, through play.<br/><br/>Compare that to a game of In A Wicked Age.  <br/><br/>Well, there's no prep away from the table.  The players have just as good an understanding of it as the GM.  Because they made it, they saw it being made right in front of them.  100%, with no exceptions.  You can't ask the GM "where's the story going?" or "what's hidden from our characters?" or "what's the GM going to throw at us next?" in a meaningful way.  There's no room for that assumption that the GM has something up his sleeve, some entertaining flash to bring to the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197208/#Comment_197208" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T12:12:28+00:00" title="March 16, 2009 12:12PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In all honesty, IaWA is exactly what I've come to love about INDIE games and what I think makes D&amp;D so inferior in its inflexibility.<br/><br/>I see your points now and it's pretty much what I was thinking.

It is perfectly functional to have the GM role include some notion of "scenario" creation.  The GM creates a cool dungeon for us to conquer.  Or the GM creates an intricate mystery for us to solve.  And if the GM creates a bad dungeon or mystery he's dropped the ball.  Hell, that applies to indie games like Sorcerer or Dogs in the Vineyard.  God, knows I've written suck-ass Dogs towns before and that's my fault.  That's the basic simple risk of any creative endeavor.  You might simply fail in whatever set of responsibilities are assigned to you.<br/><br/>All of that is COMPLETELY different from the totally fucked-up *social* notion that the GM is there to provide my fun.  That no matter what the players do the GM is there is somehow make it work and make sure everyone has a good time, no matter what.  THAT'S what needs to be killed dead.<br/><br/>And I don't have a clue how to do it.  Anyone who is capable of distinguishing between these two things usually adjust expectations to game like IAWA or PtA just fine.  Because they recognize (regardless of whether they can articulate it or not) that different games assign different game responsibilities.  And so yeah, the "just explain it" options works just fine.<br/><br/>But for people who CAN'T distinguish between those two things.

Slow the mechanics down in the beginning and stop and highlight what you are rolling for and what the roll means, if it is different in this system. When I was running Shadow of Yesterday, the players that had the most old school RPG experience were the ones that were the hardest to get Intent out of. Their answers were always task-related, and never spoke to what the character's Intent was. But, it is hard to "break that habit" until the Intent matters to the player. Once I got them in a roll where it mattered if they succeeded or failed, I mean personally mattered, then it was a lot easier to hash out what the roll meant and what the player was rolling for.<br/>The trouble is, that takes time to hash out and the less you know about the player behind the dice, the longer it will take to reach that point where you can find that one roll that the player is really invested in.</blockquote>\nAssume I know nothing about the player behind the dice and I have less than four hours to figure it out and make it happen.

Of course, remember that in the examples I gave it didn't matter if the game didn't have a GM - if the perception is ingrained enough the person teaching the rules is the GM. And it's ingrained enough in the vast majority of players. At the S-G Lounge I had a "menu" of games that showed which ones didn't need a GM or could be GMed by anyone. So I'm not trying to be the GM everytime. But for some games you need to be the GM to teach it.<br/><br/>I've just finished reading IAWA and plan to try it out this weekend, but that's really the first game I've read that I think this might be possible with - from the get go - at a convention.<br/><br/>When I run Dirty Secrets I am usually the investigator because that's the most demanding role and everyone else is brand new to it, but at the S-G Lounge one of the other players had played it with me before so I asked her to be the investigator and that went great. But I don't know if it would have worked with just anyone who showed up. <br/><br/>Won't work for WGP because the fighting mechanics are very intense.<br/><br/>I don't think I could throw a neophyte into the producer role in PTA. What if they GM traditional games and treat it just like running one of those?

First, and most simple, we call him the referee. That's not so clever, though -- Traveller did it more than thirty years ago.<br/><br/>More usefully, we leave many decisions that would typically be in the hands of the referee instead explicitly to the table authority. That is, the consensus of the table as a whole. We also explicitly apportion (did I invent a word?) control over the rules to players other than the referee during mini-games by designating a Caller and handing them the turn sequence to command. They don't mediate the narrative (the referee still does that when gate-keeping genre conventions and story "secrets", and the table at large does it most of the rest of the time) but they control the flow of the mini-game sequence, deciding when phases are over, who goes next, etc. Taking this out of the hands of the "GM" might prove to be a powerful way to alter the culture of the table.<br/><br/>All that said, it's worth keeping in mind that this all (including distribution of narrative authority) levels out the effort around the table, and plenty of players DO NOT WANT. You can't do anything about that, because they simply prefer to play differently. Personally, I think our philosophy derives largely from my own increasing laziness and the fact that I am handed the Viking Hat with undue frequency.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197373/#Comment_197373" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T08:49:10+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  8:49AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scott,<br/>\n  RE: "Assume I know nothing about the player behind the dice and I have less than four hours to figure it out and make it happen.

But more than just a preview, walk them through step by step and show them what each mechanic or moving part means and why.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A classic training technique is to explain important concepts 3 times<br/>\n1) Just tell them what it is (e.g., Fold doesn't mean you die, it just means you lose the stakes)<br/>\n2) Tell them why it is that way or how it works (This is a game about helping a community, death is not always on the line)<br/>\n3) Demonstrate it working as you describe (Do Initiation and try not to make the stakes, I kill you)<br/>\n  For the kind of thing you are talking about, this technique seems like it will be valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hope that helps and I look forward to SGL in Rocktober!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197382/#Comment_197382" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T09:17:28+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  9:17AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2009 9:20AM by scottdunphy.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>A classic training technique is to explain important concepts 3 times<br/>1) Just tell them what it is (e.g., Fold doesn't mean you die, it just means you lose the stakes)<br/>2) Tell them why it is that way or how it works (This is a game about helping a community, death is not always on the line)<br/>3) Demonstrate it working as you describe (Do Initiation and try not to make the stakes, I kill you)<br/>For the kind of thing you are talking about, this technique seems like it will be valuable.</blockquote>\nI feel like I do that in the course of most of the games I run, but it doesn't always change that perception. I do like that DitV has a nice demo of the rules right at the beginning. I think that's what I'm looking for now, a quick demo of Story Game concepts like scene framing, setting stakes, and pursuing beliefs/issues - where it's clear that the GM isn't really the GM. In fact, if it were something I could do standing in the hallway or muster area in a couple minutes to sell the concepts, that would be ideal.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Hope that helps and I look forward to SGL in Rocktober!</blockquote>\nUh, I think you lost me here. Are you referring to Tacticon? That's actually on Labor Day weekend.

I will be in San Diego.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, I think you can use a scene from PTA to show decent Scene Framing, I think that is one that is collaborative, but still has a GM-like presence.<br/>\n  And I love how TSOY does Stake Setting.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But I can't think of one game that does it all and can demo all that in one easy scene. ditv comes close, but I don't think it perfectly does all that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe, you need to pick one game that you really love, inject whatever is missing from it regarding scene framing, stake setting, etc. into it and then demo it as "Roleplay the Story Games Way Demo" or something. Then if people want to learn those techniques, they are good to go.<br/>\n  Then for the rest of SGL, you can play more naturally and just answer questions instead of trying too hard to teach them these things every time?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, I think it really helps if you play your part authentically and not as a means of compensating for what the other player knows  or how you judge their play. So if someone is rolling for Tasks instead of Conflicts, stop him and ask him why his character is in this conflict and then make the roll about that, instead of whether they can climb that wall or whatever. Just like you would with another Story Gamer. You know, assume they want to learn and they they are not "set in their ways" and you will find that most of the time they do (not to say you aren't but a reminder can't hurt even if you are already doing that).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bummer, maybe we can have a little mini-SGL action at Attactix or something?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197500/#Comment_197500" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T16:44:30+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  4:44PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steffen</cite>Hey, what about playing a few rounds of an Engle Matrix Game, like Dracula or Jack the Ripper?</blockquote>\nLinks please?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Ah, crap, I can't go then.
