<p>Okay, so I'm writing Misery Bubblegum, which is all about social uncertainty among kids who are intensely tied up in what everyone thinks about everyone else, and how their actions impact others.</p>
<p>No problem there.  Joe never gets (certain) resources for anything he does ... he only gets resources for things other people do.  If he hopes that Charlene will notice him then he gets Misery points when she ignores him and Happy points (or whatever better name I think up) when she notices him.</p>
<p>Charlene's player has no direct knowledge of how Joe gets rewarded, though she may (if she's attentive) figure it out.  Or she may make up some entirely different theory ("Joe gets points when he pisses me off by getting in my way!") that is also supported by the facts that she's noticed.</p>
<p>There's lots more details of that, but there's the general gist, and I'm pretty pleased with that section of the game.  What it <em>doesn't</em> immediately explain to me is why there should ever be any external conflict ... at all.  I'm not even talking space-aliens crashing the Sadie Hawkins dance (although I totally approve of such things) I'm even talking things like "Who gets the top rank on mid-term exams?" or such mundane (but perhaps vital) questions.</p>
<p>It is vital for <strong>Joe</strong> that Charlene be striving with real adversity ... that makes her decisions genuine, often contradictory, quirkily human.  It's what makes his attachment to her actions painful and human and dramatic.</p>
<p>But, absent any external conflict, it's not vital to <strong>Charlene</strong> that she be striving with real adversity.  What matters to her is that (say) Blake the Hotty is striving with a fractured family life so that his response to her attempts at friendship (and maybe more!) are quirky and human and contradictory.</p>
<p>So I need some reward to draw people to invest in <em>their own stories</em> as well as paying attention to the actions of others, or else the whole thing is just going to be silly and flat.</p>
<p>Now I think I know what <em>losing</em> an external conflict buys you:  It lets you make new opinions/hopes/desires about the winner.  So if Arima beats Miyazawa out for the Valedictorian spot, she gets to create her seething hatred of him, and use that to fuel her later attempts to unseat him from primacy in the school.  And, to some extent, that's a benefit to Arima's player too ... he's got another player who is intensely interested in his story.</p>
<p>But I get the impression that I need to create some additional benefit for winning conflicts.  Currently the only equivalent to "skills" or "abilities" in MB is "Hangups" ... which are things you're so insecure or obsessed with that you ground all of your emotional energy (good and bad) through them.  I could see <em>staking</em> a hangup on a given conflict ... Miyazawa stakes her "Need for Praise" on the valedictorian conflict, and the like.  Maybe winning the conflict lets you change/strengthen/control the Hangup in some way?</p>
<p>Why do players go out and fight such conflicts?  What is it they hope to gain?  How can I reinforce that in the system, and get them salivatingly eager to go out and win?</p>

                            Also, consider the role of parents / teachers / adults / society at large.  Maybe you can gain and lose benefits by fitting / rejecting their expectations of you?                        </div>

<p>Well, I figured that the GM (on behalf of all the NPCs) is also in on the whole game of benefitting/suffering depending on what the players do.  So on behalf of the parents the GM would have "Joe is a good boy" as one of the things she'd be watching for in play.</p>
<p>I keep thinking that the players should also have the chance to make expectations of the GM ... both of society / adults as a whole and of the world.  Things like "Adults never understand" (which maybe that's something that makes the kid happy, or maybe it makes him miserable, who knows?) or "Dumb luck never cuts me a break" or stuff like that, but I'm not sure whether it fits with the rest of what's happening.</p>
<p>So you think that winning should strengthen the hangup?  Because following an obsession just makes you more obsessed?  Should there ever be a reason to reduce the hangup?</p>

                            Actually, you got your answer right there -- you gain the benefit of succeeding or failing your parents / the world at large.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Your Parents and The World could accumulate Misery and Happy that could be spent, by others of course, for your benefit somehow.<br/>

<p>Ben ... interesting!  So when you want to turn up the volume on somebody taking action X (to show that it's not just an accident, they really mean it) the question is not "Will you risk being killed in order to do X?" (as in many games) but "Will you disappoint/defy others in order to do X?"</p>
<p>And to the extent that the GM represents the world and external influences (and does, indeed, accumulate Misery and Happiness that she can spend against and for other players) the question of "Will you defy the GM in order to do X?" actually becomes very similar to "Will you risk consequences in order to do X?"</p>
<p>Hmmmm ... Maybe that's all the system needs.  Maybe I'm just trying to add external resources because (like a combat system) my past experience tells me that RPGs have that.</p>

                            How about the reducing a Hang-Up to reduce the misery cost of failure?  I think that's the better suggestion I made:  "Oh, I didn't really care about that goal anyway.  It's stupid.  I'm just going to forget about it, and mock those that try" is very teenage.  I know I did that.  A lot.<br/>

<p>Oh, yeah ... I definitely want to get that sour grapes thing going on.  Good thinking!</p>
<p>But reducing the misery cost of the conflict assumes that failing a conflict has a direct misery cost, which I'm not at all sure it should.</p>
<p>To my mind, the misery cost of failure is indirect ... it makes you care more about other people, and then they stomp all over your feelings.  Yeah, designing this game isn't a psychological exercise for me.  <em>Not at all</em>.  Heh.</p>
<p>But if you fail, and your friends support you, that's better than succeeding.  It shows you that you have real friends.  I don't want an automatic misery cost to get in the way of that.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p><em>"The proper office of a friend is to side with you when you are wrong. Nearly anybody will side with you when you are right."  - Mark Twain</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>But I <em>totally</em> agree that failure should be the key to reducing the intensity of your Hangups.  I am right with you there.  Here's an alternate thought.  Since losing a conflict has you buy an opinion about another person, maybe reducing the strength of a Hangup lets you modify the strength of the opinion you buy about them.  Like, if you lose a conflict and would normally make a 4 point opinion about someone else, then if you <em>also</em> reduce the relevant hangup then you can make a five point opinion about them instead.  Your opinion is stronger, because it was formed in the process of <em>them changing you</em>.</p>
<p>Or, maybe, as you said you reduce the strength of the Hangup to reduce the extent to which you form an opinion about them ... "They're not really that cool ... I didn't want to win that skateboarding competition anyway.  Skateboarding's stupid."</p>
<p>Do you think that might work?  Or do you think I'm overlooking the benefit of dispensing misery on failed conflicts?  Or is there a third way neither of us has thought of yet?</p>

                            I don't really know.  It seems to me that losing either makes you more obsessed (I'll win next time) or less obsessed (Man, whatever, it doesn't matter) and the choice you make isn't really a choice but more about the type of damage you are trying to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
I am also struck, unrelatedly, that "your parents" and "the world" are very different things, and at times have necessarily conflicting desires.<br/>

<p>Yeah.  I'm not sure about the hangup-modifications either.  I get the feeling that they should both go up and down in the course of a character's life, but my resource-managing instincts for character-development tell me that therefore it should be an <em>investment</em> to inrease it and a <em>payout</em> when it drops.  Which may be baloney.</p>
<p>On the "parents" and "world" ... yeah, they can be opposed in their uses, but I don't see that as being a problem, even when they're played by the same person (the GM) in the same way.  When I play characters I often have two parts of them that are in diametric opposition (cowardice vs. conscience, for instance).  It's just a helpful way to be able to jump any which way I feel like.</p>
