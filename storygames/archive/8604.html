It found it pretty fascinating that I had several of the items Paul calls for in the text - or at least reasonable symbolic substitutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of a chunk of silver I'm using a silver ring etched with Celtic knotwork. My clear quartz is not smooth and polished but it is still cool. The small bone comes from an old Lakota choker I once had. The bloodstone is a nice green one with just enough red in it to provide the symbolic resonance the game calls for. I do not have any dark pearls, so as a substitute I'm using a hematite cabochon because I think it has a very similar vibe. I have several pieces of sodalite, but the one in the pic is the only one that has any green in it. All my others are very blue. I have no bits of polished black walnut, and I haven't chosen a substitute for that token yet. I'm still thinking of something that is appropriate to use. I might end up using either a bit of driftwood or maybe a small chunk of Connemara marble. In any case, there's nothing in the pic to represent that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I'm sure there are other folks excited about the game who are already going around scrounging for things to use as tokens. If you are, take a pic of yours and post it in this thread. I'd love to see what other folks are coming up with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="vernal-chieftan-tokens.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://harpingmonkey.com/images/vernal-chieftan-tokens.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190712/#Comment_190712" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T22:01:08+00:00" title="January 30, 2009 10:01PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mick,<br><br>Cool.<br><br>So I suppose I need to confess that my own set of special tokens is also a work in progress? (And your set is more complete than mine!)<br><br><img alt="image" height="353" src="http://halfmeme.com/TVC_tokens.png" style="border: 1px;" width="518"/><br/><br/>My own magic token is also a ring. Danielle and I got promise rings for each other a year or so before we got engaged. They're sterling silver and darkly cut with the word <i>pietas</i>.<br/><br/>My food token is a resin sheep knuckle, stained to look like bone. It's part of a set of five I bought from MacGregor Historic Games a few years ago.<br/><br/>And regarding your substitutions, I think driftwood is an excellent alternate token for remembrance. Another good one might be a piece of fossilized wood.<br/><br/>Also, I like your hematite, and damn if I don't know that a suitably large dark pearl is going to be a challenge to acquire, but I should say that secrets is symbolically represented by a pearl because it's an oyster's secret.<br/><br/>Paul                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190738/#Comment_190738" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-31T12:43:52+00:00" title="January 31, 2009 12:43PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul: if you go shopping in beading and bijoux creation hobby stores you should be able to find quite easily some Swarovski pearls. They are really made of crystal, and then colored on the surface, but they have many colors, including a very nice gunmetal grey. My girlfriend sells them, for example:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.legazzeladre.it/perle-12mm-dark-grey-p-3442.html" rel="nofollow">Dark Grey swarovski pearls</a><br/><a href="http://www.legazzeladre.it/perle-12mm-night-blue-p-3436.html" rel="nofollow">Night Blue sw. pearls</a><br/><br/>These are real pearls, instead:<br/><a href="http://www.legazzeladre.it/perla-scaramazza-grigioverde-10mm-p-3966.html" rel="nofollow">Grey/Green pearls</a><br/><a href="http://www.legazzeladre.it/perla-scaramazza-bluviolaverde-p-3204.html" rel="nofollow">Blue/Purple/Green pearls</a><br/><br/>Also, I have skimmed the pdf, and I've noticed you say about the sodalite: "the greener, the better", but sodalite is much more commonly blue/white... is that a typo?<br/><br/><a href="http://www.legazzeladre.it/pietre-semipreziose-sodalite-c-145_286.html" rel="nofollow">Sodalite pieces</a><br/><br/>(all the links above go to my gf online shop, which is in Italy though, so if you are interested in such things you are probably better off shopping closer to you)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
