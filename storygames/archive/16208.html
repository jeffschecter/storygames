I was looking at the FLOW system from Stalker as my ideal, particularly the way it separates player ideas from character capabilities. It seems like a very sturdy system, assuming that everyone's on board with what means what.

This is my choice for playing Exalted, or anything with a massive scale - where I want a wide range of action types to be meangingful.<br/><br/>Godlike powers? Yes. Mortal skills? Yes. One on one fights? Yes. Party conflicts? Yes. Army battles? Yes. The workings of nations and politics? Yes. Wanna pull back and do a sweeping pass of history to jump ahead a few centuries? No problem.<br/><br/>Although the book recommends (in 2nd edition), that you use the same starting stats regardless of the power level they're supposed to express, my preferred method is to use stats as a scale.  This more easily lets powerful characters express their power against lesser powered characters. As power increases on something closer to an exponential scale, crunch only increases on a linear scale ONLY when you have characters of differing power levels. Most of the time the increased values cancel each other out before you roll.<br/><br/>In my mind, it is the best choice. I've run a couple of games using HQ in the Exalted world. Players accomplished many battles and made lots of progress. In one game, in the course of 8 hours (spread across 8 1 hour lunches) one group got into conflicts with gods, Exalted, and swarms of other enemies, carved out a piece of Creation and were on their way to establishing their own small nation, making war with a nearby Dragonblood principality and demonic pirates.  I. LOVE. IT.<br/><br/>Ryan Macklin's <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/tag/mythender/" rel="nofollow">Mythender</a> is also a good choice, when that comes out. It's especially goodif you still want the pursuit of more power to be a major element of your game. It's only for very specific stories, however (that is, killing Gods and taking their stuff) but it's quite fun and over the top. Not as good as HQ for an extended campaign, but better for a one-shot or short series of sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370177/#Comment_370177" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-30T13:45:56+00:00" title="March 30, 2012  1:45PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2012 1:48PM by David Artman.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one's mentioned Amber, yet, so I will:<br/>* Diceless<br/>* Low crunch (but not fiated)<br/>* Shapers-of-reality power levels<br/>* Doesn't have to be the Zelazny universe, with a bit of filing and scraping<br/><br/>On a similar note, Mage (full rules, including Dynamic Magic) kicks ass at the UberMaster levels, though you might find you spend a lot of time noodling over combining spheres in weird ways.

All would be fun to play, but right now, as far as this thread goes, I've got some leads to follow up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370222/#Comment_370222" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-30T19:40:57+00:00" title="March 30, 2012  7:40PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2012 7:44PM by johnzo.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Hero System as written and as it can be played under constraints (but NOT under-powered!).</blockquote>\nYou are suggesting that someone who doesn't want a complex game should learn a complex game well enough so that they can skillfully tune it to be the non-complex game that they want?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.dundrum.com/_images/upload/doesnotcompute.gif"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370226/#Comment_370226" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-30T20:32:11+00:00" title="March 30, 2012  8:32PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Hero System as written and as it can be played under constraints (but NOT under-powered!).</blockquote>\nYou are suggesting that someone who doesn't want a complex game should learn a complex game well enough so that they can skillfully tune it to be the non-complex game that they want?<br/><br/>Easy now!

BW is complex--lots of weird exceptions to the core mechanics. Hero is really rather simple--you can learn to play it in minutes, if you have any other (trad) RPG experience (though it does require someone to teach you to "right" way to roll to hit, which isn't quite in the RAW: roll and say what DCV you hit). <i>Making a character</i> can be complex, but not if you toggle off some of the worst offenders (e.g., pools). Compare that to, say, making a specific final character by back-tracing Lifepaths (to be sure you hit every prereq) in BW. That can be hairy as hell, with some final LP desires (with others, it's as easy as C-B-A). And don't get me started on maneuvering with multiple combatants...!<br/><br/>... And we can surely enjoy a semantic debate about what "complex" means when I am unemployed again.<br/><br/>But anyway... yeah, Hero. It rocks. :P<br/>[edit - And that's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, I reckon, for Hero thread-jacking here--I'm done; anyone else interested, please start a new thread.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy" title="ParadoxBoy"><img alt="ParadoxBoy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy">ParadoxBoy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370686/#Comment_370686" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-02T11:47:42+00:00" title="April  2, 2012 11:47AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>House of Cards</i> is meant to handle high character power with light mechanics: even if you're not intending to bring one of your Powers to bear, a high enough card will accomplish improbable or impossible feats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
