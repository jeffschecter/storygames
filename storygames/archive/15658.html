Has anyone had a chance to play with it? Their demo seems to be just a bunch of pages with interactive elements on each page. I was wondering it if could do game-like things. Does it provide ways to "roll random numbers" or hyperlink to another page?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355005/#Comment_355005" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T13:04:02+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  1:04PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be pretty damn frustrated if this becomes a "thing" and people start releasing their games in iPad only format . . .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355006/#Comment_355006" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T13:05:50+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  1:05PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a (goddamn) link to <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/" rel="nofollow">iBooks Author</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355007/#Comment_355007" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T13:10:32+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  1:10PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: doho123</cite>Does it provide ways to "roll random numbers" or hyperlink to another page?</blockquote>\nThe <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/gallery.html" rel="nofollow">list of widgets</a> claims that the HTML widget uses <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashcode_UserGuide/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">Dashcode</a> which uses JavaScript.

It has some serious shortcomings, but also some amazing potential.<br/><br/>Shortcoming #1: this is a walled garden WITHIN a walled garden. Your potential customer has to have the device, then decide to download iBooks, then search for your book. So far as I know there's no way to create a web link directly to a "buy this book" page.<br/><br/>Shortcoming #2: no custom fonts. You can design with custom fonts, and custom fonts show up in the table of contents page view, but they don't actually render. (This gives a little insight into how Apple does the ToC view where you can see all the pages: they're actually snapshots taken when the book is "compiled.")<br/><br/>Shortcoming #2: the interactive books still seems like second class citizens. They render much later than everything else. The default set is fairly limited too, but as Lester mentioned they are highly extensible as long as you know some HTML and Javacode.<br/><br/>Shortcoming #4: you can't start from scratch or even from an empty set of chapters, you have to start with a template. A slight mitigation: the templates are quite nice looking.<br/><br/>Shortcoming #5: It's a proprietary format. Not only does it only go in the iBooks store, but you can't do anything that isn't supported by the Author tool. I'm pretty sure HTML is underlying this somehow, but you can't get at it in any meaningful way. There isn't even a chance of porting.<br/><br/>Shortcoming #6: I haven't found an easy way to import text or synchronize text from another doc. This is the biggest deal breaker for me.<br/><br/>Opportunity #1: The design interface is a very nice. It fits a nice middle ground between InDesign and Word, something that anybody can learn pretty quickly but with a fair amount of advanced options.<br/><br/>Opportunity #2: The created books are automatically multi-orientation with the landscape being a page-by-page embellished view and portrait being a continuous mostly-text view. I wish some of the other frameworks did similar.<br/><br/>Basically, it makes the best-looking ebooks I've seen, on par with PDF, but lighter weight and multi-orientation. To get that you have to take a whole lot of Apple caveats and you won't easily be able to develop in parallel for another platform. Unless Apple opens it up in some way I don't see this taking off unless the education market really drives it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355025/#Comment_355025" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T14:53:19+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  2:53PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this war is getting interesting.  As someone who cares what documents look like in electronic format, Apple wins by a mile.  Kindle layout is so, so ugly in comparison.  But Amazon destroys Apple when it comes to distribution, sales, and accessibility (the latter due to the price of their device).  I bet the next step in the arms race will be pretty Kindle ebooks (rather than cheap iPads), but who knows how long that will take.  I guess Fire makes that possible, though.  And Apple made iPods ubiquitous before by coming out with a cheap version for everyone.<br/><br/>All in all, though, pretty exciting that Apple hasn't ceded the ground on ebooks.  A multi-horse race will always be better for consumers, since competition will (hopefully) lead to better options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355027/#Comment_355027" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T15:01:49+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  3:01PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, the computing power to display a pretty ePub (or other format, but I'd prefer not to reinvent the wheel) isn't much.

Their solution seems to be to provide a command line tool used to take some marked up input and produce KF8 out the back end. As inputs, it apparently takes HTML, EPUB, and (not very well, it admits) PDF.<br/><br/>To me this is a really interesting counter-approach, and one I personally applaud -- "we're not going to really tell you what tools to use for creation, we're going to give you a compiler and tell you (a) what it accepts as input, and (b) maybe suggest how you can get best results out of the compiled output".<br/><br/>KF8 is specifically built, it seems, to go after simple but layout heavy texts (like children's books, and presumably, text books).<br/><br/>Apple's approach is intriguing: I have friends who claim that independent, small-genre publishers will leap on this especially if they're willing to give away books and make money in some other fashion (the EULA specifically forbids monetization through "subscription", but I wonder how far that goes -- for example, I wonder how they will address crowd-funded projects? If I kick-start and say "once I get 1000 bucks, all contributors will get a free iBook", is that fundamentally a subscription? Apple's lawyers would no doubt try to argue that it is, but I'm not so sure they can make the case, especially if the iBook is only one of the chotchkies made available to participants -- crowd-funding subsidizes the <i>work</i>, explicitly, and not the output I'd say: of course, they can out-starve any opposition that might use crowd-funding in the first place, so I'm not sure I'd be keen on being a test-case).<br/><br/>But I really wonder, exactly <i>who</i> does Apple think their customers are? No doubt, they'll have to juice platform adoption by signing up big-business adopters. But I'm not sure I'm convinced the business model works here.

The copyright to the content is specifically retained by the content creator, not Apple.<br/><br/>It's not clear to me that the EULA restricts you from distributing works at no cost while you sell the work through Apple's distribution.<br/><br/>What's most disturbing to me about this EULA is not necessarily its terms ("we're giving you this software for free in exchange for exclusive, commercial distribution rights to anything you produce with it"), it's that it unreasonably allows Apple to unilaterally decide what works to distribute, with no recourse on the part of the creator. Should Apple decide to accept your work for distribution, and then decide to yank it, you have no recourse. There's no indication on how long Apple may take to decide whether or not to distribute your work.<br/><br/>It would seem more reasonable for the EULA to grant Apple right-of-first-refusal on commercial distribution.<br/><br/>But then, I suppose Apple's (quite sensible) response is going to be, "Hey! Don't sweat it -- if you don't want to lock in with us, just don't use our awesome, easy-to-use tool!"<br/><br/>I'm pretty darned sure they're not going to close the loop to the extent that they'll insist on iBook Author as the <i>only</i> way to get iBooks into their distribution network -- that would be insane on their part, I should have thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355085/#Comment_355085" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T07:20:55+00:00" title="January 20, 2012  7:20AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>it's that it unreasonably allows Apple to unilaterally decide what works to distribute, with no recourse on the part of the creator.

Doesn't Amazon unilaterally decide what works to distribute, with no recourse on the part of the creator in exactly the same way?  And if they aren't going to distribute the iBook version of your masterpiece <i>Nazi Demon Pornography</i> or whatever, you can still distribute it in any other format you like through any other means.  You can package it up as a PDF and sell it at Lulu or whatever.

If I kick-start and say "once I get 1000 bucks, all contributors will get a free iBook", is that fundamentally a subscription? Apple's lawyers would no doubt try to argue that it is, but I'm not so sure they can make the case, especially if the iBook is only one of the chotchkies made available to participants -- crowd-funding subsidizes the<i>work</i>, explicitly, and not the output I'd say: of course, they can out-starve any opposition that might use crowd-funding in the first place, so I'm not sure I'd be keen on being a test-case).</blockquote>\n[deleted stuff I got wrong]<br/><br/>EDIT: I just read another article on the software, and I was wrong.

I don't really see this as revolutionizing anything, aside from Apple trying to gain a profit through educational channels; and this whole "education" deal is to get parents and educators to warm up to buying expensive electronics for their kids. Yes it's a slick demo, but I simulated a teacher saying "okay class, now turn to page 34" and I couldn't figure out how to do that easily once I was on a different page. (Searching for page 34 wound up taking me to page 51 or something).<br/><br/>While I completely get the whole "e-book" sell through (cheaper to produce, easier to carry, no dead trees, etc. etc), I just don't see this kind of thing working in a grade school environment. It reminds me of taking my kids to the zoo, and they fiddle with all of the interactive displays to see what they do (ooooh, shiny button!) but all of the content is completely lost in the experience of playing with the shiny toys. <br/><br/>Additionally, I'm guessing that after the first few "gee whiz bang" books produced with Apple, I doubt that publishers really want to go through the expense and headache of becoming multi-media superstars. I think it will quickly become a turn-key, quick-just-scan-our-latest-text-book-in and be done with it kind of thing.<br/><br/>Where it gets interesting is what creative, independent, artsy-fartsy people do with it instead of textbooks, especially when it comes to embedding HTML5 and javascript into the thing.

Doesn't Amazon unilaterally decide what works to distribute, with no recourse on the part of the creator in exactly the same way?  And if they aren't going to distribute the iBook version of your masterpiece<i>Nazi Demon Pornography</i>or whatever, you can still distribute it in any other format you like through any other means.  You can package it up as a PDF and sell it at Lulu or whatever.  Yeah?<br/><br/>I don't think it's like a book store. Of course Apple can decide what to stock and what not to stock, but typically book store chain's decisions about what to stock, and what not, don't restrict a publisher from flogging the book through some <i>other</i> channels.<br/><br/>In the case where there <i>are</i> exclusive distribution rights agreements reached (for example, perhaps when Walmart or something like that signs up suppliers to distribution agreements), I suspect those agreements guarantee a certain amount of revenue passed over in exchange for exclusive distribution: i.e. guaranteed purchase of so many units per month, or so many months, and such and so. I also suspect that, should the distributor suddenly cease distribution, there might be penalties involved they'd have to pay. At any rate, I totally suspect that a lawyer might advise producers <i>not to sign</i> any agreement that doesn't offer them <i>something</i> in the way of this kind of protection.<br/><br/>But with Apple's agreement, you cede to their terms the minute you use their software -- at least with respect to the works you make with it.<br/><br/>The provisions in the agreement give Apple the right to totally stifle a person's right to make money off their work, if they use Apple's software and I've read at least one op-ed piece (Ars Technica I think?) that suggested this might get them into anti-trust difficulties -- they're basically using the license for one thing to leverage acceptance for a separate thing (their software leveraging acceptance for their distribution services).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355902/#Comment_355902" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T09:57:46+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  9:57AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2012 9:58AM by viktor_haag.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [covered off: should have read more thread before I responded]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355904/#Comment_355904" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T10:01:35+00:00" title="January 25, 2012 10:01AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Sage">@Sage</a>: it would be useless anyway, since being created with the iBA tool you could *still* only distribute it through Apple.

They're lending legitimacy to Apple's channel, and that is <i>certainly</i> worth something that Apple is gonna have to pay for.<br/><br/>In the long run, I can see academic presses shilling for Apple's channel by fully leveraging the technology. But there would need to be major sweetener in it for them.<br/><br/>iBA seems to me to be a grass-roots momentum builder piece in their overall channel strategy, and not (at this point) a serious cornerstone. It's GarageBand for technical/educational content authors, not Aperture, Final Cut Pro, or LogicPro. I'm fully expecting to see Apple asses iBA's progress in the marketplace in conjunction with their channel development, and then come in with a Pro equivalent for "serious publishers". Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if they've already given top-sekret beta versions of iBA-Pro to their publisher partners, assuring them that they'll have input into how it gets developed before it gets released officially.<br/><br/>But until they have some notion that there's <i>there</i>  there in the marketplace, I'm not sure they'll leap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355908/#Comment_355908" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T10:18:28+00:00" title="January 25, 2012 10:18AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite><br/><br/>I can heartily recommend Apple's Pages for the same purpose. $20 gets you an App that can stand up to InDesign for very basic tasks and imposes no constraints on the PDFs your produce.</blockquote>\nAgreed that Pages is a nice piece of software. I've tried to use it, several times, for several projects where I might have (in a previous life) chosen to use FrameMaker (curse you Adobe for end-of-life-ing the perfect tech-writing software on OSX), or InDesign.<br/><br/>You're right that for basic tasks, it seems to do quite nicely indeed. There were constantly times when I bumped into a wall and say damn, I guess I can't do that with Pages. But on the whole, none of them were deal-breakers.<br/><br/>I have heard that the PDFs it produces are idiosyncratic enough to maybe have potential issues with the major POD players, though; so if you use it, pre-flight those PDFs, and better yet, make damn sure before you do anything major with it that it will work (otherwise, you'll probably have to spend time porting layout and content to another tool). I have no proof of that end of things myself, as I haven't yet had to POD from a Pages-produced PDF.

The files output by iBooks Author are pretty much proprietary to Apple -- they certainly aren't claiming that it's anything to do with ePub, for example (certainly a look over Apple's iBooks Author doesn't mention ePub or standards at all, as far as I could tell).<br/><br/>It's just a simple choice for the publisher. Use Pages (or something similar) to make an ePub format book, which you can convert to .mobi and sell for Kindles and so forth. But you lose out on all the fancy layout and interactivity. Or, use the free iBooks Author tool and get all those wizzy features, with the understanding that this is going on only work on iPads (via the iBookstore where money changes hands).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356896/#Comment_356896" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T06:17:49+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  6:17AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And yet, they feed to their ePub reader (iBooks) and are proprietary and undocumented extensions to ePub files and standard (as stated upthread). <br/><br/>Instead of contributing to the ePub standard (and/or documenting the format) they are extending it with proprietary extensions.
