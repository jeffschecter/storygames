I did a couple in 2007 and really got into the 'con game' thing. So I will be at a good few UK cons - Conpulsion and Furnace definitely. Indiecon, Dragonmeet and GameExpo are all on the radar as well.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I achieved this one. Conpulsion, Games Expo, Furnace and Dragonmeet all happened very nicely indeed. Indiecon sadly couldn't happen due to work considerations. The convention scene in the UK is HOT at the moment, with a smorgasbord of excellent events to choose from, virutally at will. Cons are going to be a big part of my 2009 - starting with Conception in four short weeks time!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>- Return to GenCon US and this year not be at deaths door for most of the time. I had a horrid foot infection which floored me for most of the con so I am determined to get more out of it this time. I'm going to be attempting to stay nearer to the action as well so I can hit some of the late night gaming events.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, due to being made redundant, this never happened and it pained me. However, I took the time to address something else in the list, so it wasn't a total loss!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>- I'm determined to get Duty &amp; Honour into a playable state by the end of the year. I also need to conclude another piece of business with regard to the game. If it comes off then I will definitely have something to be shouting about.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nDone. Done and Done. My big success story of the year. The 'other piece of business' was sniffing around the actual Sharpe licence, but I decided against it. Wisely, I feel after all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>- I'm going to continue with our current gaming regime of one group doing long term games, one doing shorter games and one doing playtesting. We've got Malcolm's 'Hot War' lined up as our next short run game (as a playtest) and I want to try out Iain McAllisters 'Stitch' as well (which I think is going to become an awesome game)</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThis has worked. We have played Hot War, Cold City, Primetime Adventures and Fate 3.0 in the small group format and The Great Pendragon Campaign, Red Box Hack, Duty &amp; Honour and D&amp;D4e; in the larger group. We've also played a load of big board games, including Twilight Imperium and Arkham Asylum and started our own Blood Bowl league. Its been a really solid year of gaming for my extended gaming family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>- And finally I have to get a new job. Honestly. The one I have is desperate.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, that worked. And then didn't. And then did. I'm a damned sight happier this New Year than I was last New Year!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185142/#Comment_185142" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T09:32:03+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  9:32AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2008 9:32AM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My moments of fun in gaming came from the fact that I actually did some on a semi-regular basis in 2008.

I'm a 3rd level ice elf spirit shaman/thief. It's hella fun, and I'm looking into playing it, what, 12 more times this coming year! I realized that I haven't used my Diplomacy 8 skill at all yet, but in January's session it's looking like a diplomacy smorgasboard.</blockquote>\nSo, we played more of the 3.5 E6 game. When 4e came out, we converted wholesale to 4e, and played several sessions more (even getting a new member, a co-worker of Clinton's). Unfortunately, due to everyone being on vacation we haven't met up again in two months, but I expect to resume in Jan.\n<blockquote>Other than that, which is set, my weekly and bi-weekly games are not set, but always changing. On my plate now is a game that's inspired by Necessary Evil (supervillains must stop the evil alien menace because the superheroes are dead) using the RISUS system, which my weekly group is going to start playing once the holidays are over.</blockquote>\nWe ended up playing the RISUS game for a bit. However, that weekly group kind of fell apart due to two of the female players each having a baby this year. So that group is more of a social meetup/boardgame group these days due to kidscreeching/distrctions, and I've instead launched into more weekend campaigns with friends.\n<blockquote>Shadowrun (Eric P GMing and using his hack, a medium/long term game, starting this weekend)<br>Seiyuu (Matt Gandy's anime game)<br>INUMA (I want to play again)<br><i>EDIT:</i>D&amp;D 4e. Holy crap yes.</br></br></br></blockquote>\nWe played SR for about half a year. Then it went on hold for the con season, and so we could retool the system. Still a lot of love for it, and we're beginning again this year.<br>Matt never finished Seiyuu yet, so we haven't played.<br>INUMA: Didn't run/play.<br>D&amp;D 4e: Played the fuck out of it. At one point, I had three simultaneous D&amp;D campaigns going on. Bi-weekly group is currently finishing up an X-Crawl 4e game after several sessions.<br><br>My "glitter-eyed honeymoon" with 4e is pretty much over. I don't think of it as "Teh Bestest Version Evorz", but its' a super-solid awesome game in its own right. Still playing it, and holy crap did it influence how I look at all these other games with simple/lame combat options in favor of "4e-ifying" everything I play. However, whereas before I was ready to simply buy Every Book WOTC Releases for the Game, Period: I'm now more into a "wait and see" approach. The martial book didn't do it for me, but I'm totally waiting for the PHB 2.\n<blockquote><b>Destined to Run or Play</b><br>Earthdawn (either set in Barsaive, or set in the Iron City, an India-themed campaign world that my weekly game group uses on and off for years)<br>Tenra Bansho Zero, a game that shows a war between three countries in three mini-campaigns, with three perspectives.<br>Virtue and Valour (that's right Tim, I'm RUNNING IT!)<br>Together by Jack Aidley<br>Legend of the Five Rings, the Crab Falls campaign I mentioned in another thread here. In no fewer than 5 sessions.<br>Best Friends AMBER Throne War, stolen straight from Fred. It will get run this year.<br>If In a Wicked Age gets put together, I will run a generational game based on that (we had great experiences when we played from cobbled notes about a year or two ago).<br>A gritty game based on World War Z, with multiple mini-campaigns and one shots that build up to a larger campaign. Haven't decided a system, and AFMBE just doesn't seem quite right. Nemesis seems closer to what I want with its Unknown Armies style horror stuff.<br>Colonial Gothic: Planning a 2-session game for Winter/Spring, set in colonial New Jersey.<br>...and I'm open for just about anything else.<br>If Do comes out, that will go down. But I don't want Daniel to rush.<br>If Stranger Things comes out, that will go down. But I don't want John to rush.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nEarthdawn: Right about the time I was going to run it, 4e came out. Where I planned to play 4e on the side while doing Earthdawn, once I played it 4e destroyed all intention of running anything fantasy-related using any other system. I'm planning on coming back to Earthdawn at some point (with a retooled combat system, at least a few tactical options)... but probably not in 2009.<br/><br/>TBZ: Played a lot of it early in the year.<br/>Virtue and Valor: Didn't get a chance.<br/>Together: Nope.<br/>L5R: I ran this game, and it was really fucking awesome. It ended up going on for such a long time that it interfered with all my other loose gaming plans, including the WWZ and Colonial Gothic games. It wrapped up about 2 months ago with basically the Shadowlands conquering the Crab Domain, with the Crab fleeing north. Later, I plan on coming back to this game but using another system: There's still a lot of Juice in the characters we made.<br/><br/>(cont)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185144/#Comment_185144" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T09:41:50+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  9:41AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My plan to have Ryuu Tama translated by August hit huge, rediculous snags this year, as did some other artistic endeavours.

The answer is "When I get off my fucking ass and finish the last of the rules edits so Luke and Dro can lay the thing out".<br/><br/>Secret Anime-Themed Project was "Maid: The Role-Playing Game".

Since I'm working from home, I'm not meeting so many people on a daily basis, and there's been some serious restructuring at the company - we're working on some cool new projects right now, but the future is a bit uncertain.<br/><br/>HolmCon was okay; however, it was the least exciting of the four, and I've taken some steps to make next years' con more interesting. The concept is now "wear a shirt and show us something": No T-shirts are allowed, and all participants must bring something new and exciting to show us all. New games, workshops, debates...<br/><br/>Solmukohta was good, but not as cool as I'd expected, mostly due to some weird social interactions. I did, however, host a debate on educational role-playing which I found very interesting (a lot of people talked about their projects and ideas). And I'm editing next year's Knutepunkt book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185161/#Comment_185161" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T10:27:47+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 10:27AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool to look back like this.

We had fun. Long runs of the most fun games were played, and we had fun with them - In A Wicked Age, 3:16, Trail of Cthulhu stand out.\n<blockquote>I'm organizing a games on demand stream for my local convention.

I am having too much fun just letting other people write games for me to play. When the time comes that I need to write and publish a game, I figure I will know it. That is a round about way of saying, I have given up on pressuring myself to do this.\n<blockquote>Edit: Plus Game Chef 2008, of course. Looking forward to that. </blockquote>\nTook part, had fun.

Actually, I think they could do it fairly easy while still being pretty faithful to the core feel of the class magic (hard matrixes == dailies, etc).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185217/#Comment_185217" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T14:16:44+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  2:16PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played a lot of very successful <i>Reign</i>.<br/>Worked on getting <i>Spirit of the Far Future</i> to a releasable state.<br/>Determined that SotFF was not very legal (and the timing was awful) but that we had a great game under the covers that was NOT <i>Traveller</i>.<br/>Sat on the idea for a long time, pondering the enormous obstacle of the bits we left out of SotFF by referring back to <i>Traveller</i>.<br/>Wrote and started playtesting the result, <i>Diaspora</i>.<br/>There's a lot of <i>Reign</i> in the cracks there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185244/#Comment_185244" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T18:20:01+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  6:20PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To do in 2008:<br/>\nPlay - PTA, Don't Rest Your Head, SOTC, and maybe Red Box Hack, need to get involved with the locals<br/>\nPlaytest - Twisted Rhymes, Memory Crimes then fix it once it gets trounced<br/>\n- The Interman Game - once approved and playtested by the author of the book<br/>\nDesign - a couple of card games, my zombie programs in Alaska game<br/>\nCreate Time.<br/>\nThe last one is key. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere things stand at the end of the year:<br/>\nPlayed: SOTC, Psi-Run, Werewolf.

It is a pretty good game without a name but needs playtesting and a bit of work.<br/>\nDesign:  I worked up a mystery game for a design challenge which has some promise.  I have a DRYH hack/supplement in the works.  Twisted Rhymes is still alive in its original form or intention.  I can get something out of it.

It's a total railroad product, but it made for some of the most enjoyable 3.5 I've ever had in the DM role. Definitely a high-point for what turned out to be our last 3.5 session.<br/><br/>Then we moved on to <i>Star Wars Saga Edtion</i>. Most of the group was hungry enough for 4e that we jumped on the next best thing, i.e. SWSE. It was a very nice break from all the D&amp;D we'd been playing until then, and the hints at what 4e would be like got most of us very excited.<br/><br/>The run-up to 4e also afforded us a few nights spent playing games like <i>BattleLore</i> and <i>Arkham Horror</i>. I became quite a fan of the latter.<br/><br/>Then, come July, we started <i>Keep on the Shadowfell</i> and have not looked back. The doubters fell in love with 4e, and we've had, IMO, some of the most fun I've ever seen in the six years I've been playing with these guys.<br/><br/>In extra-group activities, I missed GenCon, but made it to Forge Midwest. Rocked like Gibraltar. Played <i>Spione</i>, <i>Hero's Banner, Anachonrism, Best Friends</i>, and <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>.<br/><br/>I organized three ENWorld Chicago Gamedays (19, 20, and 21). Ran D&amp;D 3.5 and D&amp;D 4e. Played <i>Hero's Banner, Paranoia XP, (D)Agon, and Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</i>.<br/><br/>Booyah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185271/#Comment_185271" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T04:31:01+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  4:31AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>But I was<b>right</b></blockquote>\nI dunno, man.

Hopefully now that I've gotten myself out of commercial publishing, that kind of perspective can go away for good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fragmad" title="fragmad"><img alt="fragmad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fragmad">fragmad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185301/#Comment_185301" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T09:03:30+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  9:03AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To do in 2008 Games wise: <br/>\n<br/>\n- Go to UK Student Nationals and have fun. <br/>\n- Play more as a player rather than as a GM. <br/>\n- Get some people involved in playing Call of Cthulhu. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat actually happened: <br/>\n<br/>\n- Student Nationals was a blast.

I ran 'The Haunting' mid-semester at the university games society for a bunch of new kids. They've been asking me when I'm going to do more Cthulhu.

Although I was invited to 2 4e games, and got to play now and then, I think I've missed half of those games to Other Obligations, like work or family. Which is a shame, because I get to play with some pretty hard-core funists.

I'm in Sword &amp; Sorcery heaven.
