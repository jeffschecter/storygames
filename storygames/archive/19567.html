The "spend some time talking" nature of the game could use some clarification. What are we talking about, and how do I know what I should do, as a Fan? How long can we spend talking? Is it up to the Star?<br/><br/>The game might be more interesting if Rounds were quite short, but not everyone got a chance to speak each round (it doesn't seem like a good idea for each player to be able to use a word each round, as James points out). <br/><br/>As for the potential tie, I would recommend that the Stalker wins ties. (One neat way to do this might be to give everyone FIVE words, but for the Stalker one of the pieces of paper is blank, so they still "win" after they manage to play four words. Then you also don't know how close a given player is to achieving "victory".)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vcarluer" title="vcarluer"><img alt="vcarluer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vcarluer">vcarluer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435008/#Comment_435008" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-08T10:00:38+00:00" title="July  8, 2014 10:00AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey I think I will love this forum <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>Thank you for your ideas.<br/>I will try to answer you (bad English inside):<br/>* What are the Fan players trying to do? Do they really just want to get an autograph?<br/>In term of story the fan just really want to have an autograph and to speak to the star. In term of metaplay the fan wants to be the first one to have used all his words.<br/>* Are the Fans trying to help the Star catch the Stalker?<br/>So the fan do not really help the star, the fan wants to continue to talk to her. He doesn't know there is a stalker and he has no direct interest in it.<br/>The stalker thing is a victory condition for the star and the stalker of course. The fan may use this aspect to get regard from the star but I don't really know how it can be played from the fan point of view (no play test for now...)<br/><br/>If a fan wins, the star and the stalker do not lose... But they do not win either (I'm getting worse at this explanations I think). Inverse is true; if the star or stalker wins the fan does not really lose\u2026<br/>The star and stalker win conditions are: a right/false star's accusation and a stalker win on words.<br/><br/>* I can't see any reason why a player wouldn't use one of their words each round. <br/>You are right this will certainly lead to a tie game... This is not good ^^ <br/>I've changed the gameplay just before this version...<br/>My first gameplay was to limit the dialog actors to only the ones chosen by the star when she asked a question. But I thought this was leading to a too sliced / slow gameplay. But now you pointed the tied issue it seems a better idea, as Paul_T said too.<br/>This creates too a tactical gameplay for the star: asking a question to someone makes him advance to victory, but it gives clue for the stalker research.<br/>I should have kept that I think. Will think about it a little bit more but and I will certainly change the document today.<br/><br/>Another way to prevent this is to have quicker round, this is decided by the star but this cannot be guaranteed. By changing to the 'Everybody can talk' rule, I thought the star's tactical gameplay discussed above would be in the power to terminate the round. But this is quite an unclear/indirect gameplay not easy to understand, especially for a first game and this game attends to be play easily.<br/><br/>*What are we talking about, and how do I know what I should do, as a Fan? How long can we spend talking? Is it up to the Star?<br/>Yes it lacks of lead for player. A friend of mine did another short game on the same theme (only in French for now) and he gives idea, I will try to give a quick translation: <br/>What are they talking about with the star?<br/>Her last movie / concert / books...<br/>Her projects / Anecdotes on her private life<br/>The relationship with other stars<br/>Her past, loves and family...<br/><br/>In my game it is the star which asks a question, so she can drive the conversation and give an anchor to it. It will be generally chit chat ("So did you like my last show?"), but the fans need to use their paper\u2019s words so this will quickly go on other subjects.<br/><br/>* How long can we spend talking? Is it up to the Star?<br/>Yes the star can anytime end the conversation and ask a new question. When the star asks a new question this is considered as a new round (players can put down a used word)<br/><br/>I really like the FIVE words idea with a blank paper. I may have not completely understood what you suggest Paul_T, because the use you make of it will lead to a win for the stalker each time, no? The fans cannot win this way?<br/>It may be nice to have this blank paper mechanism for a random player. But I don't think I will use it because it adds to much explanation to write it in my A4 format ^^ or not\u2026<br/>I don't think I can really go further without playtest; I will try to do one next week with friends.<br/><br/><br/>Not sure this answers help you much to get a simpler idea of the game but it gives good gameplay ideas!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435011/#Comment_435011" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-08T12:26:00+00:00" title="July  8, 2014 12:26PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2014 12:26PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good answers!<br/><br/>But I agree that this could use some clarification.

And if the Star accuses you of being the Stalker, you get taken away by security.<br/><br/>Ah! I just figured out a simple way to do it.<br/><br/>Have EVERYONE write creepy words on ALL the papers, and shuffle them randomly. But include one piece of paper which says "STALKER".<br/><br/>A security guard comes in and says, "Hey, we received a death threat against the Star this morning. Mr/Ms Star, please let us know if there's anyone suspicious in here; we will be glad to remove them for you."<br/><br/>Then play normally. Everyone is going to sound a little suspicious, naturally, because they all have creepy words to use, but they'll want to draw attention to other Fans. When the Stalker uses up four words, they play the piece of paper which says "STALKER", and they win the game.<br/><br/>Everyone having to incorporate creepy words sounds like it could be a lot of fun, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vcarluer" title="vcarluer"><img alt="vcarluer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vcarluer">vcarluer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435137/#Comment_435137" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-11T01:16:40+00:00" title="July 11, 2014  1:16AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, it's more fun if everybody should have creepy words but Stalker needs to have more or you cannot find him.<br/><br/>I think about 2/3 mechanisms:<br/>- The first one use the one you suggested with each player pointing fingers at each other but in a structured way: Fans can one time per game (for all fans) asks for a vote to point at the stalker: "I've heard in the press there is a stalker which want to kill you. I think Harvey is acting really strangely since we are in this room, what do you think?". If they find the real stalker, the fans all win, either the one which have call the vote is out of the game (if this is the stalker he loses and the other wins...). The star can vote too. Players after  a discussion (which will be certainly animated) vote all together at the same time by pointing the finger at the player they think he is the stalker.<br/>- After the Star distributed the stacks to player, each fan give one paper of his choice to his right fan neighbor (this may be done twice eventually, don't know).<br/>- The star before distributing the stacks add one word to each stack except for one which will have a blank paper.<br/><br/>This raises minimum player count to 4 by the way (1 star, 1 stalker, 2 fans)<br/><br/>The first part may be quite long to explain in my format, will try.<br/>I'm not sure about the blank paper, maybe a too important advantage.<br/>Stalker role is harder, he should have a bonus with less paper for example or else, don't know. Maybe he can finish the game with one paper in hand (or can place 2 papers in last round, this is the same).<br/><br/>What do you think about this ideas? I think it will be a lot more dynamic with a suspicious atmosphere with this new rules. And everybody is involved in the stalker theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435166/#Comment_435166" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-11T19:44:05+00:00" title="July 11, 2014  7:44PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like those thoughts.<br/><br/>It might be hard to get it any more polished without some actual playtests, though.
