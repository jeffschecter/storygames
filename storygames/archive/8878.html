There were four of us - Me, Joel, Clinton and Remi - and the game methodically delivered all the goods I have seen previously in play.  <br/><br/>With four players, we each had three characters - one primary and two secondary.  We found this to be a bit too much, and in general faded one character each into the deep background.  One of mine, Raimond, never appeared in a scene.  I made sure he had an impact on the game from offstage by establishing that he beat his wife Corba (my main character).  Coloring him as a monster drove her relationship with their daughter, who was Remi's main character.  But in general, the game focused on eight characters and this felt right to us.  With four players it also went pretty fast!  We played an entire game in a little over two hours.  I missed the extra interaction six players provides a bit.  Because we had to hit our limited scenes hard, things got pretty dramatic pretty fast.  <br/><br/>I love the way Montsegur provides you with everything you need (once you've assembled the peripherals of course) and both guides you in play through "do this now" prompts and doesn't require anything else.  There's no game junk left behind, no dice, no bric a brac.  It's very streamlined.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196356/#Comment_196356" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T21:05:11+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  9:05PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I was very satisfied playing Montsegur again! I was really in-tune with what was on other people's sheets and I was able to ruthlessly batter people about by their issues. The 4-player play did make the game feel a little 'shallower', as the scene economy is so scarce. However, there were big conflicts, big surprises, and some really nice character turns along the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Corba, Phillipa, ? What story cards colored this session?<br/><br/>The short game is both due to less time on introduction to setting and rules (I speculate) and due to the fact that you are very good at setting strong scenes. Perhaps it could be an interesting challenge for you to play less hard, with more scene exploration and less conflict?<br/><br/>6 players mean 1 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 19 scenes and 6 epilogues. 4 players mean 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 scenes and 4 epilogues. I.e. actually only two scenes shorter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196378/#Comment_196378" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T04:36:00+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  4:36AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2009 4:38AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, OK, I'd forgotten the 3-3 in there.  I was thinking each act had six full scenes.  It still felt a little rushed!<br/><br/>Clinton played Pierre Roger, I played Corba, Joel played Faye, and Remi played Phillipa.  In the end Pierre Roger managed to save Amiel and married Arsende after Phillipa and Faye burned*.  Corba denounced the heresy and walked away a broken woman.  We introduced the Templar (who was an agent of the Bishop), the Cathar treasure and Corbarrio the mercenary.  It was a very cool session.<br/><br/>One other thing I noticed was that we used our interrupts sparingly, partly due to unfamiliarity and partly because the scenes were so succinct and powerful, until the very end.  We basically had a whole round of "extra" scenes during and after the final act.<br/><br/>*I wonder how Arsende felt about Pierre Roger after the surrender - he'd promised to save Faye at any cost, and was prepared to kill to do so.  But since Faye was Joel's primary, Clinton couldn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

It was a little surprising at first, but I don't think it is a bad thing. The game provides enough characters for up to six players, and it means you have many choices for less players. But after you decide which are the main characters the game leads you to quickly develop very intense and focused relations. You don't need so many secondary characters for that. Thus, some of them fade out naturally while others become really important. I think it is a very nice feature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196810/#Comment_196810" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T08:58:11+00:00" title="March 13, 2009  8:58AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>With four players, we each had three characters - one primary and two secondary.
