But this was my first time running it and my first time after reading the book.  And my first time with the people I game the most with.<br/><br/>i have many thoughts connected to it.<br/>in no particular order . . .<br/>one of them is that i need to become more consciously aware of the fact that my friends can't read my mind.<br/>this is probably a good thing.  but while none of us have played that many story games, i sometimes forget that they also don't spend time on forums like this or read the books.  so even though it takes actual play and use to get come of the techniques ingrained, it sometimes slips my mind that a lot of the things they probably haven't even thought much about on an intellectual level.<br/>some of it is probably my fault in that many things in the IaWA rules/systems I didn't explain all that explicitly.  But it strikes me that in some places, at some times during play it's probably useful to move into more of an "author stance."  My friends, in particular, carried out post conflict negotiations in character some of the time.  This wasn't all bad, but I may bring it up next time if just to make sure that they know the negotiation process isn't really an in-character thing.<br/><br/>another is that i like the layout/set-up of the book for reading it the first time.  all the examples make it nice for a first time reader.  i don't, however, like it for looking for things in the midst of play.  it would be nicer if there were more rules summary sections.  this mainly came up when one of my npcs had gained an advantage die the first time and then lost the next roll.  i thought he got the advantage die for his defense roll, but i couldn't remember for sure, and i failed to find the example that made this clear at the time.<br/><br/>i love the oracles.  i love how the random elements create such evocative seeds of a setting so quickly and easily.<br/><br/>i think we had a bit of trouble getting a grasp on setting up good best interests.  but i think we'll get better with play.  and since they don't have a mechanical tie in, it seems like the most important thing about them is just to create a nice tangled, intense situation to get things going, right?  and as a guide if anyone is ever sitting there thinking, "I don't know what I should do."  Beyond that, do they really matter?<br/>i do really like that they are "best interests" and not "goals" or "beliefs."  if they were goals or beliefs they would be things that the character is consciously aware of or actively trying to pursue.  but being "best interests" means that the character might not even know about them.<br/>a good example in our game was I said that it was in the best interests of  Aramina, a priestess, to kill her brother, Aram.  One of my friends asked me why and I said, "I dunno, we'll see."  I figured we'd find out in play, but we didn't even have to wait that long because the player of Aram said it was in his best interests to steal the magical plow from the harvest god.  I said, "Well, I guess that's probably why it's in her best interests to kill him."  I love that she doesn't have to know that he's planning to do this.  We just have to know, as players, that that it would be better for her if he was dead and gone.<br/><br/>I have some specific questions as well.<br/>One is, can NPCs come back?  I know they can't go on the We Owe list, but I'm assuming they could still come back if a subsequent chapter is taking place in the same area and it makes sense for them to be there.  Or do they have to appear in the oracle to return?<br/>Either way, if they can return, how do their character sheets work?  Are they redone from scratch?  Or do they stay the same?  Or do they get the same change/improvement options returning PCs get?<br/>Also, does the rule about new characters being able to start with particular strengths at significance 2 apply to NPCs as well as PCs?<br/><br/>I've heard people mention that PCs can change players.  But the book seems to imply that the same player will always play the same character if that character appears.  I'm a little confused about this.<br/><br/>What happens if a PC doesn't HAVE to appear (that is, she isn't at the top of the List) but someone points out that she's in the oracle, but then no one actually chooses to play her?  Should she just not appear since no one is taking that strong of an interest?<br/>related, can PCs become NPCs or vice versa?<br/><br/>ummm... i think that's it for now.  I appreciate any input any experienced IaWA players/GMs can give me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154194/#Comment_154194" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T13:30:37+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  1:30PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Yes, NPCs can come back. They are redone from scratch. Although, I guess it's up to you with particular strengths. I'd do it on an NPC by NPC basis. Some of my NPCs never get particular strengths.  But, if the NPC is returning, chances are she's central enough that she'll have a PS, and she' strong enough that I'll bump it or set it to 2. But most of them I'll leave at 1.<br/><br/>2. You are right, the assumption is that PCs stay with their players. I don't like the idea of letting people switch characters at all, but if your players want to change them up, go ahead. There's nothing wrong with that. However, I emphasize "players" and "want". Don't ask anyone to. If you have people switching, then it's up to you whether the Owe list means Player or Character.  Generally, I think it means player. That is, if Kirk is playing Hobjob, and Hobjob tops the Owe List, Kirk can say "I hate Hobjob, take him off and let me pick an oracle for a new character". Hobjob stays on there for any other appearances, but Kirk can use them for his current character (including advantage dice). If Kirk can't play the next chapter, then just skip his character on the list and go to the next person.<br/><br/>3. Just because you get the same oracle that produced a certain character, doesn't mean that character has to appear. It might be a different warlord, or another region with a beautiful girl, whatever.  Tie in other oracles to make it a different character. Each card doesn't have to be isolated. I got the virgin to be married result one time, and the four travellers in the way house. The player who picked the virgin decided that she was one of the travellers. And she didn't even know the other three guys (it doesn't say that they must be travelling together).<br/><br/>4. I'd avoid making PCs into NPCs unless the player has made it clear they aren't interested in the character anymore. Like above, if a similar result comes up, but this time isn't a PC, make the NPC a new character.  I'm cool with NPCs becoming PCs, though, if the player really was excited about an NPC, then sure. They start the character from scratch and make it their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154199/#Comment_154199" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T13:53:34+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  1:53PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alvin's answers are good. I'm just going to hit a couple of details.<br/><br/>When NPCs come back, make their sheets up from scratch, exactly the same as for new NPCs. You might understand this NPC warlord (for instance) to be the same NPC warlord as from a previous chapter, but the rules just don't care. Ruleswise, a returning NPC is exactly the same as a new NPC.<br/><br/>Starting with chapter 3, yes, you can give your NPCs significance-2 particular strengths.<br/><br/>The game doesn't allow PCs to switch players. A given PC will be owned and played always by the same player. Some groups play differently, but I don't endorse it and I'm not responsible for it!<br/><br/>You should never read the oracle as <i>requiring</i> the presence of a particular PC. If Mitch is playing a blemishless virgin, and the oracle calls for a blemishless virgin, but Mitch doesn't want to play his blemishless virgin tonight - it must be some OTHER one. Huh! There are TWO blemishless virgins? It seemed unlikely, but here's another one, so it must be true!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154210/#Comment_154210" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T14:31:03+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  2:31PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the responses, Alvin and Vincent!

It seemed obvious to me that if (par example) a PC was not on the owe list and was not guaranteed to recur, if someone said "I think that character is THIS person from this next chapter's Oracle", they were perfectly free to "re-generate" the PC (perhaps changing things to reflect the new situation in the new  chapter) and introduce them again, or the PC might be an NPC this time around. In other words, it would be the same character in the fiction, but would not necessarily have the same sheet in our real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154230/#Comment_154230" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T16:18:55+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  4:18PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>Maybe what I was asking came across more strongly than I intended.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  What I meant was that, it seems possible that when reading off the oracles someone says, "Oh!

Also, how does the option to improve a particular strength when a character recurs affect this?  As an example, imagine the strength Exorcist.  it's an example in the book, and it was also taken by a character in the first session I GMed.  Fine and good, right?  But I foresee a couple potential problems.<br>For one thing, if another character comes along who wants to be able to exorcise ghosts and demons, does he HAVE to take the version of it already created?  The first one was attached to the For Others form, which works pretty well if you're a wondering mercenary priest sending spirits to their rest in the service of others who are probably paying you.  But suppose Hypothetical Exorcist Number Two says "I want to vanquish ghosts by beating the holy bejeezus out of them!  I want to link it to With Violence!"  If no one had made the Exorcist particular strength yet, as a GM I'd be included so say "Sounds cool!  Go for it."  But Exorcism is already out there.  Is the way it works now set in stone?  In creating it for the first time, is this not just defining "How My Guy Does Exorcism" but also "How Exorcism Works For Everyone In Our World"?<br>As a more thoroughly hypothetical example, when we ended our second chapter the guy at the top of the owe list picked an oracle element about a "girl with the soul of a leopard."  When I was thinking about this later, I was imagining possible particular strengths based on having the soul of a leopard.  At first I was thinking it would be neat to make it somewhat general, calling a strength based on that "Animal Soul" or something.  I thought that, among other things, one thing that might be cool to do with the power would be shape-shifting.  But then I thought, <br>"Wait.  Someone who can turn into a leopard is going to do very different things with that power than someone who can turn into a rat.  Those two things might both be due to an Animal Soul, but it's unlikely you'd want them tied to the same forms... hmmm..."<br><br>Also I'm a little confused about the option to increase the significance of a particular strength.  What if the player of the exorcist character really digs that power and cranks it up to significance 4 or so?  What happens if another character with that strength is in a chapter?  Does his version have all those bells and whistles too?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157708/#Comment_157708" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-21T11:50:19+00:00" title="July 21, 2008 11:50AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian the particular strength represents "how this particular kind of Exorcism works for everyone in our world" if you have a different kind of exorcism also, that's fine too.  But what it means for you is that any appropriate NPC from now on can have Exorcism that works exactly like That Other Dude.  Beyond that its all your setting color.  Does that mean these are rival schools?  Different traditions from different cultures? Is one an innate ability and another has to be "taught".  Any or all of which can be established in play and become part of the description of the Strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the signifigance applies to everyone who takes that particular strength.  This not only is a game motivation to encourage reincorporation, but its also important to the nature of Particular Strengths.  Its extremely relevant that the game term "Significance" is called "Signficance" not "Power Level".  Choosing to increase a Particular Strength's Significance is not "I get more powerful".  Instead, its "This thing has just become more important in our stories and so there's more stuff we're going to define about it"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157718/#Comment_157718" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-21T12:40:54+00:00" title="July 21, 2008 12:40PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All those unresolved questions you have?
