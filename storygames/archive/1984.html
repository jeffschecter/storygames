<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1971" rel="nofollow">Timfire says:</a>:<br/><br/>"Without getting into it (too much), improvisation is more about moments of expressions, rather than a coherent flow or progression. Obviously, in the normal writing process, you can go back and edit your fiction, making everything fit tightly together. You can't really do that in improvisational artforms like RPGs. You can try, but it's really difficult and it doesn't take advantage of the main advantage of improv, to be able to tweak the fiction to fit the mood of the audience/author."<br/><br/>Which makes me wonder.  OK, thought experiment:<br/><br/>Imagine an RPG that embraces iteration.  It is divided into three acts.  You play the first act, get a general feel for where things are going and who the characters are, then you play it again with a clearer idea of the core elements.  Then you play act two.  Then you play acts one and two again, this time with act one informed by the cool stuff to come in act two.  What worked?  What was exciting?  Then you play act two again, then act three, and finally the whole thing all together in final, polished form.  It'd be sort of like workshopping a theatrical piece, or sketch comedy, or a short story.  <br/><br/>On the surface it sounds like it could get real tedious, real fast, but perhaps it's a starting point for conversation.                </div>

<p>I think you can do this, effectively, in the shorter form. As soon as you start imposing excess structure (like the three acts above), it's going to start getting unwieldy.</p>
<p>But see <em>Waiting for the Queen/Tea at Midnight</em> for a successful implementation.</p>

                            I don't know if this helps, but it reminds me of Groundhog Day. There is this part where he lived a day that he thought was perfect. He was upset that he wasn't able to make it go forward but he was in love with the way things ran. He did it again but it worked horribly because his love interest could tell that something was artificial and it ended horribly.<br/><br/>So, I guess my comment is that I agree with the imagined tediousness of it all.                        </div>

                            Well, as a thought experiment, I'm not sure.  <br/><br/>My initial notion was that after a complete iterative round, you'd have a very strong, compelling, satisfying narrative.  There's no reason the goal couldn't be to shake the fishbowl in a different way and see how things turned out after each iteration, though.  You might get an interesting "choose your own adventure" structure from that.  I could see it working well for a combat-heavy game.  Maybe you play the same scene three times and move forward with the most dramatic and interesting of the three.                        </div>

I've been running a one-shot scenario based on the latter option (incidentally, inspired partially by the mentioned <i>Groundhog day</i>), which worked out pretty well,  though the repeating part of the scenario did not happen the same way on every iteration, since players and characters knew roughly what was going to happen and acted accordingly, trying to save themselves (and innocent bystanders) from an impeding doom.<br/><br/>Also, it reminds of some of the JeepForm techniques - I'm not sure if they're written it down anywhere, but I think I've seen or witnessed a mention of them repeating scenes.                        </div>

                            It's hard to say whether it would be fun or tedious. I believe Michael and Kat Miller said they use to (still do?) play with a sort of... "reset" option. *If* I remember right,  they would sometimes say like, "I reserve the right to replay this scene." If they didn't like the scene, they would replay it. But Michael said they rarely replayed the scene, it was more of just a safety. But they did occasionally replay the scene.                        </div>

                            I will have to dig up the place I posted about this in more detail, but I ran a Paranoia adventure that worked sort of like this, with each iteration altering or subverting the previous run-thru of events. (Groundhog Day and Run Lola Run were two touchstones.)<br/><br/>And on one of the "what are you working on" or "what game would you like to see" threads from a couple months back, I got excited about the idea of a JFK assassination game in which you keep replaying the last sixty minutes before Kennedy is shot, retroactively adding more and more baroque conspiracy backstory to his death.                        </div>

                            Some ideas Mo and I have kicked around about such ideas: <br/><br/>Dry runs/Practice Scenes: Play out the same scene multiple times, trying different conflicts and resolutions each time. The game mechanics then give a way to decide which of those scenes becomes "the scene" that is used to build forward continuity. You could mix this up in lots of ways: Playing the scene different ways up to the moment of crisis, taking parts of the different runs and integrating them into the final scene you play out, and so on. Pretty much you do the try and retry that screen writers do all the time, playing out each attempt at the scene (or part attempt at scene). This could get tedious, but if people skip their go when they have no better ideas it could keep flow going. Also, it could give a good understanding of the final dramatic impact and meaning of the scene -- as you'll have seen how differently it could have turned out. <br/><br/>Save Points: When you're coming to something dangerous, hit a "save button" and go forward. If people dislike what happens, or if it just isn't working, or if you get a TPK, or whatever -- you reboot from the save point and go forward again. Hopefully this time you can do it right. This is a lot like the stuff Katt Miller did that Tim talked about. <br/><br/>Invisible Cities of the Mind: Memory is a tricky bitch, and all our post-modern authors play fucking hell with it. Why shouldn't we do the same? Have a system where a scene goes down as it goes down, but once it is part of history (and thus memory) it can be changed in flashback scenes. You get the whole "That isn't what I remember" and replay the scene, but this time with different endings. Bonus points for games with relative reality setups where doing so allows you to edit the present in more or less subtle ways.                        </div>

                            Since, Shreyas mentioned <i>Waiting/Tea</i>, yeah, the game runs in 20 minutes and the real fun is in doing it multiple times in a row and watching different stuff happen each time.  Also, in the few demos I ran at GenCon, players "took back" an action in almost every single instance of play.  Sometimes they rewinded a few actions.  This kind of think works really well in turn-based play, where you have steps to rewind.<br/><br/>See also <i>Code of Unaris</i>, which I can't believe no one's mentioned yet.  Hacking previously established facts is iteration if I've ever seen it, though limited in that you're not hacking previously established things usually (though I suppose you could if they were brought up again).                        </div>

Hacking needs to be used way more as a game mechanic that what it is.  It's something that people have done almost since the begining of RPGs.  It was just never formalized before.  I'm really kinda dissapointed that this mechanic has made a bigger splash.  I think it's fabulous.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>
