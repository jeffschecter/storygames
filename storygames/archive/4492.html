Care to spin off a thread?</blockquote>\nand:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>And I'm really curious about how you'd adapt 9W for Mage.</blockquote>\nWell, here's the thing:<br/><br/>1) I think that Nine Worlds, mechanically, is awesome. There's also a lot of love and thought in the setting.<br/>2) But the setting doesn't do much for me. I get it (especially as seen like some Neil Gaiman thing) but I just am not all that interested in Greek Mythos. <br/><br/>So, what to do?<br/><br/>After a while, it became evident that the answer was Exalted, specifically Sidereals. The Sidereals part of the Exalted world is a background rich in "saving existence", "plots within plots", "save a life, or save the world" style dramatic stuff (plus: Kung Fu!). But Exalted (which, honestly, I dig) covers that up quickly with charm rotes and large dice pool combats.<br/><br/>Nine Worlds seemed to me to be a great game to use for this setting. Set your Arete up high, and you're all kung fu, weapons and cold logic. Set you Hubris up high, and you're all magic, fate reading, fate manipulation, etc.<br/><br/>Everything else is setting gravy. Chaos would be fate manipulation IMO, but otherwise it would look very much like straight up Nine Worlds with Sidereals clumsily nailed to the side of it. I'm hoping to find another first edition corebook on eBay (now that we've hit second edition) for cheap to size up how hard it would be, or other factors.<br/><br/>But all the above can be summed up as "Ditch setting. Use Exalted. Teh Endz".<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101662/#Comment_101662" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T10:04:36+00:00" title="October  8, 2007 10:04AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for Mage the Ascension, I played a big in college and I'm really familiar with the setting. I'm interested in all the people and broad adventure issues, and not in pencil-pushing lots of new magic rotes to do stuff. Solution: Another System! WGP has been a recent favorite, but I'm kinda played out on superhero style play for a bit. So I was thinking about Nine Worlds when Snyder posted on another thread here somewhere recently that Nine Worlds was written with Mage in mind.<br/><br/>So I thought about it, and the thing I couldn't get over was this:<br/><br/>In Nine Worlds, you can be a total magical badass, or a total physical badass.  In Mage, it really supported only magical badasses.<br/><br/>My thoughts:<br/>I just came to the House Rule that fixes it when writing the above post:<br/>When making characters: All characters have to have a higher Hubris than Arete. Boom, that's it. You can be a moderate physical badass with some magical skills, or a weakling who can move mountains. Plus, with magic, you can amp your physical stuff like the Akashic (sp?) Brotherhood.<br/><br/>As for "making magic mundane", "the veil" or whatever... no houserules for that, really. Probably just use description to make it happen.<br/><br/>Simple, and kinda dull really. But if folks have thoughts to make it better at emulating Exalted or Mage, I'm all ears!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101666/#Comment_101666" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T10:57:08+00:00" title="October  8, 2007 10:57AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the fan-service, Andy!<br/><br/>I'll dig up some juice about 9W on the Codex to see what about the system would support an oMage game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101667/#Comment_101667" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T11:08:02+00:00" title="October  8, 2007 11:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite><br/>I'll dig up some juice about 9W on the Codex to see what about the system would support an oMage game.</blockquote>\nAhhhh, I'm sorry, I didn't catch that undertone of your question: "What about 9W makes it a good fit for Mage?"<br/><br/>For me, it's the following:<br/><br/>* Magic is totally freeform and descriptive. It involves four factors and four factors only:<br/>Creation - Transmutation/Manipulation - Destruction - Statis<br/>So it's really easy to have Mage dudes do their thing without a lot of paperwork: If you're a Virtual Adept, load up on Transmutation ("of time and space"), possibly Stasis, and a little of the other two just for show.<br/><br/>* Magic has gamey mechanical stuff. You can't just cast a destuction spell and say: "I destroy the Big Bad Guy's Flesh!" You have to basically Destroy their attributes, all down to 0, for them to die (IIRC). There's stuff like that for all four attributes: Creation lets you add points, Transmutation lets you move points, Destruction lets you remove points, Stasis allows you to lock down and shield attributes with points. And since it's all descriptive, you can pretty much do whatever. <br/><br/>One thing I do realize is that most Mage traditional magic would fall under Transmutation/Manipulation. That would tend to be higher in most "pulled straight from Mage" characters.<br/><br/>* You have these Muses, basically spiritual attributes/stuff you care about. You beat someone to death with your "I am looking for the Lost Princess", and it's also a campaign goal as well. With these in play, it'd be hard to get distracted from the stories of the characters (ie sublimating them for the GM's Story).<br/><br/>That's why those two settings in particular leap to mind.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101748/#Comment_101748" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T20:07:42+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  8:07PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/><br/>In Nine Worlds, you can be a total magical badass, or a total physical badass.

As magic *is* a quality of human excellence in the setting, divisions between them don't really support its main idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
