Testing your game is critical!  That brilliant idea you had on the way to work might not work well in practice.  Having other players and developers will help you work out the kinks and inspire you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you've been itching to run a specific game/story, we can do that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSign up for our <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://groups.google.com/group/NoVA-Game-Smiths" rel="nofollow">mailing list</a> and get involved!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
