However, I know that there were folks here who were interested in the game, and since I don't know what the cross-over audience is, I thought that I'd post the links here:<br/> <br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23527.0" rel="nofollow">[Dirty Secrets] Initial Playtest Process </a> <br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23527.0" rel="nofollow">[Dirty Secrets] A Sad Old Man </a><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23587.0" rel="nofollow">[Dirty Secrets] Resolving a Crime, or "Look! Look! I have a Grid, too!"</a><br/><br/>At the rate that I'm going, I'm pretty confident that I will have a beta in place by Forge Midwest, at least to demo to interested players.  After that, I'll probably begin soliciting blind playtesters.  If you want to beat the rush, feel free to give me a whisper or something.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
