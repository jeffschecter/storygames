Rather than just randomly dishing out rewards, you are saying "look, this place is cool, go there and I'll make it worth your while". It steers the characters without having to be obvious or egregious. At the same time, if players want to tie locations to their respective backstories, this is a really easy way to add zest. The locations need not even exist in a traditional sense beforehand. "Hey, Thomas, isn't your character from Wayne's Hollow?" "Yep." "Cool, it's 500xp/one advance/5 training points per character if you guys go there." "Really? Because I had an idea for my character's family..."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247800/#Comment_247800" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T09:50:28+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  9:50AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 9:51AM by Marshall Burns.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many, many years ago I made a Roadwarrior-esque RPG in which you got EXP from only two things: living through harrowing or edifying situations, and travelling to new places.

In those stories, wandering around in the woods plays a huge part, so I wanted to make that part of the game. So, we'll have a lot of the game going on inside this uber skill challenge, inspired in part by the "Wilderness Travel" suggestions Mike Mearls made in <em>Dungeon</em> (<a href="http://wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/dursc/2009July" rel="nofollow">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/dursc/2009August" rel="nofollow">Part 2</a>). You have a map; when you make the check, you move in the direction you intend. When you don't, you move at a slight angle. So, you can get yourself horribly lost.<br/><br/>I grabbed a map of Cormanthor, divided it into a grid, and I had my map\u2014to scale, no less. And since Ed Greenwood has charted this forest out in Tolkien-esque detail, I even have different forest regions, color-coded, with different DC's and different random encounter tables. See ,because once you accumulate three failures, something happens. You run into someone or something interesting. It goes on the map; so, if you run across a random troll's cave, the cave remains there and you can return to it later.<br/><br/>This adds a nice extra element. Each location on the map can net you some XP. Give each location a level, and going there gives you the XP equal to one standard monster of that level.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jrients</cite>Please pardon my ignorance, but how is this concept implemented in World of Warcraft?</blockquote>\nRichie mentioned the achievements, but you also get XP just for entering each new zone, achievements aside.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247935/#Comment_247935" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T19:44:21+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  7:44PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Jason said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247936/#Comment_247936" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T19:59:38+00:00" title="December 21, 2009  7:59PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jaywalt</cite>Wait, but doesn't the setting only exist where the players choose to investigate / explore it?<br/><br/>(If a tree falls in the GM's mind, does it make a sound?

TSOY and Burning Wheel have some kind of GM flag mechanic (key scenes in TSOY, deeds artha in Burning Wheel). The value it has is that it ties into the feedback mechanism of the game so there is mechanical support for "doing cool things."<br/><br/>I'm not sure you have to explicitly say up front "hey, if you do this, it's worth 10 points." GM excitement for something can be signaled in many ways, a cool name may be all you need. The mechanical reward is then confirmation, and completes the feedback circle. I think all that needs to be clear up front is what the mechanical reward looks like, and the GM making it clear that he has things he's excited about, and then of course the GM has to start flagging them by being genuinely excited, and giving in fiction reasons for the PCs to engage his "cool thing."<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248263/#Comment_248263" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T08:44:37+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  8:44AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why does there need to be a mechanical reward?

Mostly, it deals with combat. You can have some very exploration-heavy games of D&amp;D, but you do that by interrupting your game of D&amp;D to play a free-form game of narrative description for a while, and then go back to D&amp;D.<br/><br/>If you want to play a <em>game</em> about exploring, though, you'll need rules and mechanics for that. It doesn't <em>need</em> to use rewards, though that would count as one kind of mechanic you could use, but you would need <em>some kind</em> of mechanics. Otherwise, you don't have a game about exploring; you have a game, then you have some description, and never the twain shall meet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248347/#Comment_248347" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T15:46:07+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  3:46PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The TSoY / Solar System approach is my favourite for this sort of thing, provided that I don't want the whole game to focus on exploration to the exclusion of everything else. The basic premise (as my Solar System booklet has it) is that only things prepared by the GM in advance are worth xp when encountered in the game. This encourages the GM to prep (can't give out xp rewards without doing it) and it also encourages the players to explore prepped material instead of haring off to other directions. There's also no need to calculate the rewards in advance, as they're automatically set by the nature of the prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248355/#Comment_248355" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T16:40:19+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  4:40PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2009 4:42PM by D-503.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>People presumably are there to play the game, if the goal of the game is exploration, why does that need rewarding? Surely that's what people are there for.</blockquote>\nIf we want to play a game about exploring, why don't we play<em>a game about exploring</em>? D&amp;D doesn't deal with exploring. Mostly, it deals with combat. You can have some very exploration-heavy games of D&amp;D, but you do that by interrupting your game of D&amp;D to play a free-form game of narrative description for a while, and then go back to D&amp;D.<br/><br/>If you want to play a<em>game</em>about exploring, though, you'll need rules and mechanics for that. It doesn't<em>need</em>to use rewards, though that would count as one kind of mechanic you could use, but you would need<em>some kind</em>of mechanics. Otherwise, you don't have a game about exploring; you have a game, then you have some description, and never the twain shall meet.<br/><br/>Well, possibly you do, that's a matter for you.  I don't though.<br/><br/>Fruitful void.  You mention D&amp;D, that depends which edition.  Early editions have no rules for exploration, the game was where the rules weren't.  Later editions (3e and after) follow a fundamentally different design ethic, where the rules are intended to govern what happens in play.  For early editions, that assumption reflects a fundamental lack of understanding of the game's design goals.<br/><br/>The idea that mechanics should actively support the focus of play is simply a preference, not a rule of good design.  Edit:  Not a rule for all sorts of rpgs rather, for games that seek to actively promote story now, it probably is a rule of good design.  But that's only one kind of gaming among many.<br/><br/>But as for D&amp;D, I play and sometimes run a game of Swords and Wizardry, based on the original D&amp;D rules.  The idea that when we explore we stop playing D&amp;D, interrupt it, then go back to D&amp;D later is just so off I struggle to follow it.<br/><br/>Besides, why are you assuming the game is only where the game engine is?  I don't think that necessarily follows at all.  Again, fruitful voids.  Also, some games are built with the assumption that certain forms of social contract and group fiat will be used in certain situations, those are mechanics, they're just not written down (which I grant, with D&amp;D in particular, led to a lot of later confusion as people picked up the books blind, but I'm not in the business of defending early designers' failures to state what they viewed as obvious but in fact wasn't).<br/><br/>Edit 2.

So, I guess my question would be what games make exploring mechanically interesting in and of itself.  Jason's 4e idea, though rooted in reward systems, gets closer to that but I don't think (though I'm happy to be corrected) 4e makes exploration in itself interesting.<br/><br/>So, there's a mountain range, nobody's ever been to the other side.  What game might make the challenge of mapping the passes mechanically entertaining?

A fruitful void still needs mechanics. You don't address the issue directly, but you have a whole bunch of mechanics that address it tangentially, so the rules create an emergent dynamic that drives towards the issue.<br/><br/>I've heard people say before that earlier editions of D&amp;D had this, though I don't understand how. I also didn't play a lot of D&amp;D until 3.5, so that may be why I don't understand how. To give 3.5 or 4E a fruitful void centered on exploration would mean completely rewriting the game, so for those, you'd have an easier time just adding some mechanics. In my case, I didn't want a game <em>about</em> exploration, I just wanted exploration to play a role. I think the bits I bolted on do a good job of that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Besides, why are you assuming the game is only where the game engine is?

That would include all of the other, unwritten systems that you added to the written one. By "D&amp;D" I mean only the system of the written rules and the dynamics that emerge from them. Again, fruitful voids don't emerge from just a lack of direct mechanics; those are just plain old voids. Fruitful voids arise when you have a point that has many different mechanics leading to an emergent behavior. I don't know what mechanics in D&amp;D point you towards exploration. From what I remember playing early D&amp;D, it felt like a tactical war game. We had exploration, but it involved us narrating. We had no support from the rules, and there was nothing in the rules that asked us to do it, prompted us to do it, made us want to do it, or rewarded us for doing it. We did it if we wanted it, for no other reason than because we wanted it. In other words, we interrupted our game of D&amp;D to narrate for a while, and then we went back to playing D&amp;D. At no point did playing D&amp;D impact our descriptions, and at no point did our descriptions impact our character sheets, our die rolls, our XP, or anything else in the game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Jason's 4e idea, though rooted in reward systems, gets closer to that but I don't think (though I'm happy to be corrected) 4e makes exploration in itself interesting.</blockquote>\nNot generally, at least in and of itself. Skill challenges seem like fertile ground, but that would mean designing a clever skill challenge. I wouldn't call that 4E making exploration in itself interesting, so much as designing an interesting skill challenge about exploration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248453/#Comment_248453" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-24T11:07:03+00:00" title="December 24, 2009 11:07AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2009 11:07AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's more than a "fruitful void" (jesus christ, whatever the hell THAT is - no, I've read many definitions and I still don't get it) for exploration based games in D&amp;D3: the Survival skill, 3 gigantic "terrain type" books all about getting around in different terrains, druid and ranger wilderness-oriented classes, a bunch of spells that help with exploration, some good stuff in the DMG about exploration, wilderness travel, supplies and whether and how to keep track of them, etc. Not a ton of stuff but not nothing either.<br/><br/>If you want to look at earlier editions, why is everyone skipping AD&amp;D? There were two big settings published for AD&amp;D that were all about exploration: Maztica (adding in, no shit, some teenager-level questions about colonialism and imperialism) and the Hollow Earth. The premise of both of these games was that your adventurers, combat monsters though they may be, were needed to figure out what the hell was over there. The combat was needed because naturally in a D&amp;D world where there's lots of monsters, they tend to run away from civilization and so exploration is very dangerous.  Two thoroughly developed exploration-centric settings is pretty cool.

You describe what they see. They say what they do. Sometimes it's "I learn the local language as best I can" or "I visit the local market to see what kind of goods are for sale or wanted" or "I look for what sort of gods or spirits the people here seem to venerate" or "Do they have any kind of library or archives?" or "I take samples of the flora, what sort of plants are we talking about here" or "Let's go hunting, I wanna bring back the head of the biggest, meanest monster around these parts" or "I visit the leader of the community and demand tribute in the name of the king"...and that's even WITHOUT there being an actual plotline based around the exploration.  That's just with explorers being explorers in a new place. <br/><br/>It ain't rocket science. They say what they do and you say what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248582/#Comment_248582" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T07:35:20+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  7:35AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so that's pretty much exactly what I meant by, "I deliver a lecture, and if I'm lucky, they ask some questions."

What you want is to have characters that are highly motivated to explore and engage with exploration.  If you don't have that, no exploration game will ever work in the history of ever. Let me give you an example from a Maztica campaign I ran (koff koff) years ago.<br/><br/>Maztica is a pseudo "New World" for the Forgotten Realms. It includes Mayan-a-like, Aztec-a-like and other native-culture-a-likes on a rich continent far from the main Forgotten Realms continent. Several kings and nations have funded expeditions there and even small colonies. Heck, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/downloads" rel="nofollow">Check it out for yourself</a>, it's the first download and completely free.<br/><br/>So I decided, this is badass, this is totally new, nobody else in my group has this, let's have an exploration game. Here's what I suggested at the beginning:<br/><br/>* Your characters all have some motivation to explore and/or exploit Maztica. Share that motivation with everyone.<br/>* Your characters will all be sent by a powerful Amnian noble family to explore and report back. Scientific or magical discoveries will enhance their prestige, discoveries of gold and silver will enhance their pocketbooks. They prefer the latter but the exact mixture will be in your hands. Don't come back with nothing but plants and animals, don't come back with nothing but gold. They intend a well-rounded exploration.<br/><br/>I also gave them a summary of Maztica that was about four sentences long and said "That's what you know for sure, there's a ton of other rumors, but you have no idea if they're bullshit or not."<br/><br/>The characters we got were:<br/><br/>A ranger guide and trailblazer who was always looking out for the best place to build or improve roads<br/>A half-wild-elf wizard proto-naturalist who was constantly having the ranger trap little beasties for him and had a huge chest full of plant samples<br/>A cleric of battle who wanted to find out what the natives worshiped and report back on their suitableness for missionary work<br/><br/>And another one I can't remember. I think a paladin who suspected a demon or devil had fled his sect for the New World several decades previous and wanted to find them and send them back to hellllll.<br/><br/>In this way the answers to those questions were not a "lecture" (I still don't understand how you would even deliver a lecture, like, at all, when playing an exploration game), they were vitally important to the characters.<br/><br/>Now, D&amp;D's an action game, so it was an action exploration game, with lots of chases and fights and magic and stuff, but there's no question it was an exploration game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248599/#Comment_248599" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T10:57:08+00:00" title="December 26, 2009 10:57AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>What you want is to have characters that are highly motivated to explore and engage with exploration.

I've seen this group engage a lot of stuff they'd otherwise never bother with, once I tied it into the rest of the game. Sure, I've seen lots of games that used the approach you outline here\u2014I've even tried it myself, many times over. But inevitably, they don't care about the descriptions I give, they don't care what else is going on. If it's not going to affect their GP, their XP, their HP, or what they can do\u2014in other words, if it doesn't plug into the game at some point\u2014they don't really care. They don't explore any more of it themselves than they feel will give them some advantage, and they don't ask questions about it, because they don't care.<br/><br/>With your setup, I'd expect them to look for treasure, because it affects their gold, and they'd probably say, "Oh, and I go collect some animals, or whatever it was they asked for." Maybe I can make that more complicated by putting a few encounters in their way, but they're not going to engage that part of the exploration on their own, because at no point does it tie back into the game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>In this way the answers to those questions were not a "lecture" (I still don't understand how you would even deliver a lecture, like, at all, when playing an exploration game), they were vitally important to the characters.</blockquote>\nLike you said, "I also gave them a summary of Maztica that was about four sentences long." That's what I would call a "lecture." It really doesn't matter how well-worded, how descriptive, or how evocative your language is; if it goes on for more than 30 seconds or so, eyes glaze over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248604/#Comment_248604" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T12:22:52+00:00" title="December 26, 2009 12:22PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>But inevitably, they don't care about the descriptions I give, they don't care what else is going on.

You've gathered these players together and enthusedly said "Let's play a game of exploration" and they say "Yeah, cool, except no exploration please" and you dejectedly conclude that they're only interested in what "plugs into the game." No, they're not! They don't want to play the game!<br/><br/>Second of all, yes, if the players aren't interested in exploration stuff, then you're absolutely right, nothing you do with respect to exploration will ever work ever.  My whole list of suggestions assumes that you've got players who want to do exploration stuff. If you don't have that, no system you pick will ever succeed at delivering a good game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>With your setup, I'd expect them to look for treasure, because it affects their gold, and they'd probably say, "Oh, and I go collect some animals, or whatever it was they asked for."

There is no one who does not like to draw a map...), cast spells, get in fights with poachers, get chased by hostile natives, then, for less intense stuff, they might do some dissection on one of the animals, or keep one in captivity for a while to see how it might survive the voyage back, cast some spells on it and write down what happens, etc.<br/><br/>I don't even understand what you mean by "engage that part of the exploration on their own".  That doesn't make any sense. Do you mean independent of you, the GM (how would that work in a game with a GM?)  Or independent of each other?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>Like you said, "I also gave them a summary of Maztica that was about four sentences long." That's what I would call a "lecture."</blockquote>\nOh, sure. You have to give them the premise.  Polar exploration into a frozen land where life is rare is very different from Amazonian exploration into a dangerous jungle land full of cryptic natives and ancient temples, after all. It matters which it is.  I wouldn't call four sentences a lecture, ever, but there's always a temptation to go on and on and on. This is actually playing the game before playing the game. Why tell them "the city of Monhotton is the main colony" in a pre-game statement when you can say "Your ship glides into the bay of Monhotton" and describe it a little bit, and let them put a dot on their map marked "Monhotton" and so on. You're right, it's not a good idea. But the easiest way to avoid it is simply not to do it ever.<br/><br/>You know, that actually reminds me of another technique I used in this game which was to have the "smart characters" (the wizard, the cleric), write down and collaborate on the things they learned. This created a set of physical artifacts, as well as a challenge. The blank spot on our map is THERE, we're sure as hell not going back with that big blank spot on our map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

You set up the game so that it simultaneously mandates and encourages engagement with the thematic content. The easiest and most fun thing to do on every level \u2014\xa0from rolling dice and writing stuff down, to what you say to the other players, is in line with the thematic content of the game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
