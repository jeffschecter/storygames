Even though Apocalypse World probably wasn't "her thing", she killed it and found her own enthusiasm in it. While people around here often celebrate being selective about what we play, and exercising the power of preference, there's also something magical about <i>finding your own joy in someone else's joy</i>.<br/><br/>Noelle played this really awesome androgynous, germaphobic brainer (in AW). And while she created a largely-asexual character, she was careful not to create a character that was sexually inaccessible. So, cue the 16-year-old girl who runs the camp, and has a freak fetish. Cue the best creepy relationship I've ever seen in a game.<br/><br/>And finally, she's a really friendly and fun person. I feel joyful gaming with her, and unpressured, and social.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289421/#Comment_289421" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T15:17:06+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  3:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2010 3:17PM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I should've called it "Fuck yeah, Gamers!" instead of "Fuck yeah, Gamemasters!" but I didn't plan ahead enough when I founded it.

(He hasn't, as far as I know). Some of his choices are based on what's best for the story, some of his choices are based on what's best for the tactics half of the game. Whether it's tactics or story (he's good with both) he really knows how to make the game shine, and usually leaves me stunned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290718/#Comment_290718" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T02:56:27+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  2:56AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ping is evil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290772/#Comment_290772" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T07:13:46+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  7:13AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2010 7:15AM by cwilbur.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I knew Ping before <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">she was evil</span> it was obvious to the world that she is evil.<br/><br/>She introduced me to GURPS and is probably responsible, more than anyone else, for me continuing to roleplay past my teenage years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291006/#Comment_291006" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T21:13:30+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  9:13PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>She introduced me to GURPS and is probably responsible, more than anyone else, for me continuing to roleplay past my teenage years.</blockquote>\nThis is really fucking cool.
