It's an attempt to work out the implications of the feedback I got.<br/><br/>Some caveats:<br/><br/>1. This version is even less stable than the previous one. Literally *no* playtesting has gone into it.  It's more an attempt to just to get the ideas out on paper and try them out when I get the chance.  Example: the values for Item Risk are pulled out of thin air.  Proceed at your own risk (heh).<br/><br/>2. It's incomplete - the rules for how the GM converts Advantage to opposition for the party is left completely blank.  There'll probably need to be some sort of cost table (like Item Risk) -- probably dependent on relative difficulty.<br/><br/>Actually, now that I think about it - there's a rule missing regarding initial opposition Advantage set against a party trying to achieve a Goal.  I came up with it last night: it starts equal to the Goal Level.  The party starts out with the deck stacked against them and struggles towards victory.  That's the idea anyway.  Plus, it gives the GM the ability to throw opponents and/or obstacles at the party even if their initial rolls are made of pure win.<br/><br/>Also, the way I envisioned it, the party can have several goals going on at the same time (something like a 'Current Quests' screen in an CRPG).  Though, couple that with the previously mentioned rule and a party that's really splitting its attention can get themselves into *serious* trouble.  Which is kind of neat.<br/><br/>3. Individual rule clarity might be at an all time low.  I did the rewrite on a couple of all-day train rides.  Not the best of circumstances, by an means.  Please ask me what I meant if it's not clear. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks again.<br/><br/>-d-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140831/#Comment_140831" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T12:49:38+00:00" title="April 22, 2008 12:49PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, here we go again...<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I the only one interested in this, or do people shy away from threads where I'm commenting on games. More folks should add to the discussion, if possible. Having just one or two opinions about the rules isn't optimum. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI found whole new things to grouse about:<br/>\n<br/>\n - Starting Chargen at 4 base for stats, but havning that just be the middle of a spectrum is simply comfusing. Instead have a chart with costs, and explain how they're generated so that people can get on without the chart if they like. That is you start with 50 points, and pay the costs below:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - 1<br/>\n2 - 3<br/>\n3 - 6<br/>\n4 - 10<br/>\n5 - 15<br/>\n6 - 21<br/>\n7 - 28<br/>\n8 - 36<br/>\n9 - 45<br/>\n10 - more than you start with (55). <br/>\n<br/>\nPractically speaking a character can't take a 9... he'd have to have other scores of 1, 1, 2 and have no points for skills, or 1, 1, 1, and two points for skills. Not really practical, is it? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Generally I think you are going in a good direction, but it seems to me like you're doing it inelegantly. That is, I'm not seeing there to be any difference at all in the description of a round as an "Engagement" round, or such. Rather, what's missing is the set-up of the conflict in question. How do we know to start rolling for "Engagement" and such? Basically I'm seeing rules for "Encounters" set up that structure all of this. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for instance, you encounter a pit trap... you do a "combat" - call it an Encounter Resolution - to see how that ends up. Or another trap might be part of a larger encounter that also deals with goblins. In this way you resolve everything using the same set of rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it this way, each turn in combat is a drill-down into the Encounter overall. Looking at it closely to see how it comes out overall. Which also means that, if you want to shortcut an encounter, you can simply roll one roll to see how it came out. <br/>\n<br/>\n"Whew, those goblins were tough, and we're a little banged up, but we got through it!" <br/>\n<br/>\nAllow either side to force the drill-down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - If two players on the same side both want to decide on set-up (which is still not well defined, by the way), and they are tied in terms of Wit, who gets to decide? If your rule on ties is always roll lower on a D10, you may want to simply note that somewhere. But, again, I find ties to be interesting in that it's a mechanical opportunity to allow for something else to happen. And, generally, if you want something that another character wants, I find this to be a conflict, and try to use the regular resolution rules to adjudicate. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -  Similarly, if we two have three advantage to distribute to our fights, then if we can't decide who gets what, and we have the same Wit (not unlikely) how do we distribute? The "most even distribution" in this case is 2, 1, not very even. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about if the side can't decide how to distribute it, then everybody gets the average rounded up. Thus, in the example, we'd both get 2 if we can't decide. Gives incentive to work together to figure it out. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - You have the concept of a "Group Leader".. if multiple characters are in a fight, then are they automatically a "group?" Or can they be individuals, and each get their own round? If both are possible, does the same person decide as the one that decided on who was in the fight to begin with? Or can players have their characters opt out of groups?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a group, who decides on who the group leader is? Same assigner again? If a player can opt out, can he do so after seeing who the assigned group leader is? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Characters not involved in fights (interesting concept, btw) go last. If there are two of us, and one wants to go before the other... you know where I'm going with this... consider ties again, too...<br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140832/#Comment_140832" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T12:49:51+00:00" title="April 22, 2008 12:49PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again, having one method for resolving any such question is probably best. Like if you can make it so that it's always "agree, or the worst case happens" that would be great...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - "The side with the highest skill level gains an amount of Advantage equal to the difference between its skill level and the next-lowest skill level." There can be more than one lower skill level? I thought there were always two sides? If only two sides, then simply say the opponent's skill level. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Following the general logic that your own side's numbers cap risk as a multiplier, shouldn't the cap on AOE be a multiplier equal to the number of opponents? I mean, after all, AOE isn't really all that more effective against a single opponent than any other attack, right? OK, sure, it's easier to hit with perhaps...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - The Maneuver cards are full of awesome, as the hep kids say these days. I really like that presentation. Then again, I'm wierd, so somebody else should comment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - I just noted that the Kill Damage definition seems to have an inherent contradiction. If I'm using sword at level 6, and I have spear at level 7, and you do 6 Kill Damage to me, can I continue fighting with spear? Or am I out? The rules say both, it seems to me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Heck with it, I know it's more traditional, but... how about instead of skill, you have to simply do the opponent's "Toughness" (A muscle skill) in damage to take him out? Modified by armor? In other words, Kill Damage is Skill Damage to Toughness. This solves the problem of double accounting on fighting skills. It also means that for other sorts of encounters, you can have other abilities as the "goal" ability to reduce. If/when the skill is the same (target skill and active skill), then reductions to it in terms of kill damage count as skill damage. ??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - I still think that the Alter is multiple other actions being called something. The trap example is just a normal Kill Damage attack. The example of using tactics to stop attacks against you is still "Maneuvering" or whatever. Using an ability to enable another one, as in the case of finding a boulder to use with AOW push, is interesting, and I'd call that "scouting" or such. <br/>\n<br/>\n - What's the mechanical result of move? Is the character now in a different fight, or out of the fight if he likes? That should be noted. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - For Gain Item, it never fails, no matter the cost. How about the player can simply decline to get the item, if he doesn't want to take the consequences of the failure? Or, perhaps, he has to make another roll to do so? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -  As for how to purchase stuff to oppose the characters, start with the simplest conversion rate... one advantage becomes one level of skill for some opposing force in an encounter. This is a very sensible currency, as it makes sense in terms of how skill differential converts to advantage, one for one. Basically you either use the skill to create advantage, or you use advantage to create skill. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat might need tweaking so that it's easier or harder to create one or the other. Like perhaps it's easier to create skill from advantage for the GM, so he gets enough points. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, it doesn't have to be non-combat advantage, either. If you get 4 advantage, perhaps the GM can have another skill 4 orc appear, spending the advantage to have that happen. Or something like that. It's cool because it means that the party retains the advantage, while the other side can have lots of numbers. Fits the source material (D&amp;D). <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140840/#Comment_140840" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T14:02:16+00:00" title="April 22, 2008  2:02PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moving to Game Design Help                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141064/#Comment_141064" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T08:16:15+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  8:16AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>More folks should add to the discussion, if possible.

You start with (Level * 10) + 10 points.<br/>2. PCs are generally going to start at Level 4 (50 points) to represent your average adventurer.  1 is total Mook, 2-3 is NPC/local villager level, &gt;4 is getting into higher heroic levels.<br/><br/>Everything else stays the same.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Generally I think you are going in a good direction, but it seems to me like you're doing it inelegantly.</blockquote>\nAgreed.  The basic pattern I've been following is constantly moving from specific to general systems.  <br/><br/>That said, I rather do like the "Engagement" phase.<br/><br/>As soon as I finished the rules, I envisioned using them for a completely non-combat conflict: dueling lawyers! (Yes, I've been playing Phoenix Wright *waaaay* too much).<br/><br/>The setup: Two sides on a case, with a couple of weeks leading to trial to prepare.  Each lawyer has an assistant.<br/><br/>Engagement:<br/>\t1. The two lawyers (A and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> decide to make W:Law rolls to Gain Advantage.  The each succeed, gaining +3 Advantage for their side.<br/>\t2. A's assistant does a Find maneuver, declaring that he wants to find a key piece of evidence - basically a 'vessel' of Advantage that they can produce later at an important turn in the trial.<br/>\t[Side note: the way I envision all this narratively is that as players we don't know what the evidence is.  We'll narrate what it is when it's produced/user].<br/>\t3. The calculated Risk is 1 (object) + 2 (to produce X advantage later? I need some sort of conversion -- I was thinking something like 5 points) = 3 Risk total.  He then proceeds to fail his roll.  His side finds the item, but the other side knows about that particular piece of evidence and can prepare for it.  A is now at 0 Advantage, B at 6.<br/>\t4. B's assistant decides to pull an Alter Battleground maneuver, using P:Psychology.  He sets the Risk at 3 and declares that he's looking into A's background trying to find a personal weakness that they can exploit. He rolls successfully.  He works with A's player to narrate a weakness: this case is *just* like the *only case he's ever lost*.  The established change to the fight is that B can use a W:Law roll at some point during the conflict to do a Skill Attack by referencing that previous case, shaking A's confidence.<br/>\t5. B's assistant's action costs him 3 Advantage, leaving the final score as: A=0, B=3.  B enters as the winner of the Engagement and gets to set the initial situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141065/#Comment_141065" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T08:16:26+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  8:16AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [On generalized conflict resolution]<br/><br/>I can write specific rules for this, but yes, the system is supposed to be as deep as you need it to be.

That is, have that be an action. The opposition, if they want to move on from engagement to actual fighting has to take a successful action (Move or "Engage" or something) to force it to move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me it's just another round of conflict, but with the action selected being pre-fighting stuff. Just like when you move out of combat while it's going on, you can then do actions that you can only do when disengaged like recovery. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome fights may occur when both sides stumble across each other, and neither side takes any time to prepare, but instead just charge in at each other. If it's not mandatory on the front, and it's not mandatory that you move on from it immediately after the "phase" then it's just another action. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the point I'm trying to get at. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - In terms of Generalized rules, the way I'd like it personally is if you have the general conflcit rules, and then have combat simply be a specific application of those rules. But, then again, that's just me.<br/>\n<br/>\n - On using conflicts to resolve which player gets to decide things, I ran two ideas into each other:<br/>\n  -  Either state that the rule is always to roll lower on a D10 when ties in stats come up for deciding. Or<br/>\n  -  When something like this comes up, and the players want to contest each other, don't compare stats, instead have a conflict to see which gets his way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - My mistake, I meant round in favor of the opposition, in the example. So if there's 3 disadvantage, each player gets 2. If there's 3 advantage to split, each player gets 1. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - For the grouping thing, then, are you saying that I can't be part of a group, selecting you as the leader, if I so like? What I did for HQ was to have everybody declare if they wanted to be a leader. If they did not, then they had to declare which leader they were following. So each player decides what team he's on for themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - So, for turn order, it's:<br/>\n  -  First the engaged characters from high to low.<br/>\n  -  Then the disengaged characters from high to low. <br/>\nIs that it? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not just do all characters in skill order from high to low, regardless of engagement? Isn't that simpler? And doesn't it make for more interesting dynamics? I mean it then makes a difference if you get away whether or not the opponent can re-engage you before you recover. Or is that the point that you always want to allow for interruptions of such actions? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141134/#Comment_141134" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T12:38:18+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 12:38PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>"The side with the highest skill level gains an amount of Advantage equal to the difference between its skill level and the next-lowest skill level."

There can be as many sides in a fight as you like.<br/><br/>Again, this might not be totally clear in this version... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Following the general logic that your own side's numbers cap risk as a multiplier, shouldn't the cap on AOE be a multiplier equal to the number of opponents? I mean, after all, AOE isn't really all that more effective against a single opponent than any other attack, right? OK, sure, it's easier to hit with perhaps...</blockquote>\nWell, capping as a multiplier against opponents would imply a max damage to them. Does that follow? AoEs were supposed to represent really huge presses against the enemy.  It seems valid to me to spend 7 Advantage and push a giant boulder on an enemy and do 7 Kill Damage in that one move.  Or spread that 7 out amongst multiple enemies.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I just noted that the Kill Damage definition seems to have an inherent contradiction. If I'm using sword at level 6, and I have spear at level 7, and you do 6 Kill Damage to me, can I continue fighting with spear? Or am I out? The rules say both, it seems to me. </blockquote>\nNot a contradiction, but it's probably unclear what I meant.<br/><br/>If you're using M6:Sword and I do 6 Kill Damage, you're out.  If I do 5 Kill Damage and you switch to A7:Spear before I hit you for 1 more Kill Damage, then you're fine until I get two more hits in.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Heck with it, I know it's more traditional, but... how about instead of skill, you have to simply do the opponent's "Toughness" (A muscle skill) in damage to take him out? Modified by armor?</blockquote>\nMy reaction to this is "Not so much."  The Kill Damage represents how long you can stay in a conflict.  Since I'm trying to generalize it, I'd say that for something like the law case in the previous post, the amount of Kill Damage would be based on the lawyer's Wit (W:Law).  It represents the strength of your case.  If I take it out, I win.<br/><br/>Armor would be based on the Item creation rules ("Add +1, Add +2"), increasing the Kill Damage you can take.<br/><br/>Also, I think I need to clarify something.  Skill Damage doesn't actually affect skills *individually*.  It affects a *catagory* of skills by lowering your effective Stat.  I hope the character sheet makes that clear (Stat - Skill Damage = Effective Stat).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141135/#Comment_141135" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T12:38:32+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 12:38PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I still think that the Alter is multiple other actions being called something.

That last example is an Alter maneuver using P:Scout as the skill.  Since I want to generalize this as much as possible, it seems fair to me that the same maneuver does this and the lawyer example (find an opponent's psychological weakness) above.  The only difference is the skill you use.<br/><br/>Alter in all three cases does actually change the battlefield.  The trap may cause Kill Damage, but only if the opponent enters that area.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>What's the mechanical result of move?

If you moved to a different fight, you're in that fight.<br/><br/>If anyone followed you, they're where you are.  Either in a new fight with just you (if you tried running away) or as part of the new fight you were trying to reach.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>For Gain Item, it never fails, no matter the cost.

Neat idea. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  That said: would it still cost you the advantage you'd spent on it?  Interesting dilema: I lose the advantage either way - do I take the item and help my enemy, or do I cut my losses?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>As for how to purchase stuff to oppose the characters, start with the simplest conversion rate... one advantage becomes one level of skill for some opposing force in an encounter. This is a very sensible currency, as it makes sense in terms of how skill differential converts to advantage, one for one. Basically you either use the skill to create advantage, or you use advantage to create skill.</blockquote>\nAs I wrote my response to the character creation rules, I came up with something:<br/><br/>1 point to create an enemy of the same level.<br/>+2, +3, +4 for each additional level above.<br/>Mooks (lower levels) come in sets of multiples for the same cost.<br/><br/>Or the GM can create Items/Objects as obstacles using the same costs as already in the rules.<br/><br/>In other words, it seems relative levels would be the way to go, rather than absolutes.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Anyhow, it doesn't have to be non-combat advantage, either. If you get 4 advantage, perhaps the GM can have another skill 4 orc appear, spending the advantage to have that happen. Or something like that. It's cool because it means that the party retains the advantage, while the other side can have lots of numbers. Fits the source material (D&amp;D).</blockquote>\nThis is exactly how I envisioned it working: Advantage from opposition to Quests would be spent in this manner: an obstacle is an obstacle, whether it's a minotaur or a particularly evil grand vizir. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks again for all the feedback!<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141243/#Comment_141243" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T07:01:42+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  7:01AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - I think I was probably just reading in the "two sides" thing, having understood that from the previous version. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Frankly I think that any notion that AOE is any more "risky" or "potent" an attack form is largely just a statement of preference. I mean, if you want to emulate the feel of the fireball, it might make sense to do it this way. But there's no real right and wrong here. I could argue, in fact, that somebody could charge headlong into a group of bad guys and threaten to kill them all off in one sweep of their sword. Basically if AOE can do as much damage as you want, I could argue that any other attack could, if ramped up, do as much damage as you want, with commensurate risk. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point being that I understand if you want to have some variability here between these things, as it's interesting in terms of tactical depth and exploration. But I don't see any particular way of stating how these things work as inherently better than another, thematically. Cap it at 3 per enemy seems to be just as effective at making this discrimination than not capping it. Again, if in fact you're trying to emulate D&amp;D, which did cap damage done by a fireball such that one of them could not kill certain very powerful monsters (but could damage many of that monster), then your version doesn't do that well. And a cap is more rich tactically. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I remain unconvinced there that an open cap is neccessarily better. But I think it's probably a pretty minor thing. The argument against my method is that mine requires a small math step to calculate the cap. If it's not really useful, then getting rid of that step makes sense from that POV. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - I get the weapon change thing now, and how it affects durability. That said, it seems to suffer from several potential problems:<br/>\n  -  Is there ever any reason for a character to not use their best weapon ability? Mechanically? Why would I ever use my sword, if my spear ability was one higher? <br/>\n  -  Worse, can you actually see players spending points on having both sword and spear skill? What's the possible use? If it's to have a backup weapon, why not carry two spears? <br/>\n  -  If it's the ranged attack argument, then I'll arm myself with a bunch of javelins. A weapon that I can use both as a ranged attack and melee. Weapons all do the same damage, so there's no downside to this, right? <br/>\n  -  If you allow this, to make it mechanically sound, you have to be very specific about when the weapon skill can be changed. It might even become important to have a way to determine who gets to declare first. Again, all presupposing we can come up with a mechanical reason that this would ever happen. <br/>\n  -  In HQ, no matter what skill you switch to, you always use the same pool of points. Switching skills just changes your rolls, and doesn't affect your distance from losing. <br/>\n  -  And, in fact, a common criticism leveled at HQ is that basing your pool size on your skills is actually somewhat problematic. For a couple of reasons. First, it's a double whammy. Skill makes you both better at whittling down your opponent, and makes you harder to whittle down. Second, since the bids are relative, there's not a lot of difference no matter what size pool you have. Lots of people play where the pool is always 100 points, in every contest. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not advocating giving everybody the same pool, actually, but instead, as I've said, basing it on some ability that represents the ability to take a hit. Since your attacks are not, in fact, relative. In your law case example, the lawyer's Law skill determines how well he does, and his Will skill stat determines how long and hard he's willing to fight. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis adds complexity to play because now you have more skills being pulled into conflicts. Not complexity that's going to make things more difficult, just a richer feel. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, it's just an idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141244/#Comment_141244" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T07:02:01+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  7:02AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Change the name of Skill Damage to "Stat Damage." Since that's what it is. No?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - With regards to Alter, you're including multiple mechanical effects in the same action. That's the problem. The inputs don't matter, like if multiple skills can be used. That might be true for every action, if they're generalized. But you don't lump move and damage into "fight" action, because they have different sorts of mechanical effects as a result of using them. As such, you want to take every single mechanical effect identifiable, and make it into it's own action. It seems to me. It's a consistency thing. All of the other actions have only one effect, why does "Alter" have more than one? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow this all assumes that you are going to have rules for all of this. What it sounds like to me is that you're handwaving and saying, "There are some actions which we don't have mechanially defined that a character can take, which could have any number of mechanical outcomes. When a player tries one of these, simply make up the mechanical outcome you feel best represents that action's success." <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a crucial question... is your intent only to allow the listed actions, or can players basically make ones up, requiring the GM to create a rule as to it's effect? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf, in fact, that's the case, then you need to state this more clearly, and give guidelines on how to create the mechanics. If it's not your intent, if you intend that all actions declared by a player be fit into a set of mechanical action options, then you need to have every one of those mechanical effects be defined as it's own action. <br/>\n<br/>\n"Changes the battlefield" is the in-game description of what the actions in question do. Again, I could say, "Attacking" is an action, and throw both Skill Damage and Kill Damage under it, explaining that both are the results of "Attacking." But you segregate them both out by mechanical effect, instead. To be consistent (and, I'd argue, effective) you should do this for every mechanical option. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is called "Effects First" design. Instead of looking at the in-game action, and defining how they work in mechanical terms, we look at the mechanical options available, and then say that they can be employed with any in-game description that fits. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for instance, "Kill Damage" in a courtroom is not, in fact, a physical attack. Delaying your opponent in a courtroom won't be "Altering the Battlefield" in any but a metaphorical sense. Though, if you throw a storm of paperwork at them, it might well have the same mechanical effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet the players select from the mechanical effects, those they want to employ, and then get as creative as they want in describing what their character is doing in-game to cause that effect to happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - See how important it is to list the actual mechanical effect of a move. Until now I had no idea that people had the optuion to "follow" you. This is mechanically problematic, however. Because how do you get away from people then, if they don't want to let you? Apparently you can't? Or do I misunderstand? <br/>\n<br/>\n - Yes, absolutely, the player has to pay the overhead to attempt to get an item. If they don't want to take the repercussions of failure getting the item, then that sunk cost is lost. Otherwise players will just try over and over until they get what they want. There has to be a limit. Once they've squandered their advantage looking for treasure, the orcs are back on their tails, and it's time to address other issues. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Your shedule for creating adversity is interesting. Looks good prima facie, but is definitely something to playtest. There could easily be an optimal strategy for the GM to use in spending (many small enemies, one big enemy, being the most likely). <br/>\n<br/>\n - An obstacle is an obstacle, yes. Whether it be the Grand Vizier, or a clever pit trap, or the Vizier's Lawyer facing off against you in court. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141268/#Comment_141268" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T09:03:06+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  9:03AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>How long between levels?</blockquote>\nI gave this a bit of thought and then realized you could directly connect it to Goals.  Group Goals by type (based on the cost you have to put into them), and then have a system where you gain a level when you complete so many Goals.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I like the idea of an engagement phase, too, but I like even better that there could be multiple such rounds. That is, have that be an action. The opposition, if they want to move on from engagement to actual fighting has to take a successful action (Move or "Engage" or something) to force it to move on.</blockquote>\nI'm seeing your point.  So the new system would be completely generalized - any sort of conflict and you're using Maneuvers.  You decide up-front whether it's a single action or if you're drilling down to turns.<br/><br/>The examples of ambush, etc, work exactly the same.  The advantage of this is you drop all the specialized rules for applying rules from Engagement, etc.<br/><br/>So it would work something like this:<br/><br/>* Something happens!  We're going to conflict rules.  Doesn't matter if it's a trap or an ambush or whatever.<br/>* If you're actively in conflict, declare what skill you're using to fight (to set up Kill Damage limits).  <br/>* If you're in what used to be called Engagement, then it's exactly as the rules laid out before, except no one starts in a fight.  Easy.<br/>* Everybody takes action in reverse Fight skill order (simplifying things as per your later comment: rather than going one fight at a time, just go in order of skills).<br/>* On your action, you could do something like trying to actively engage the enemy by Moving towards them to fight.<br/>* If you're actually close enough to fight, just declare *who you're attacking*.  This makes it much easier.  Sides are defined by everyone attacking a specific target/side who agree to work together.<br/><br/>Does that make it any clearer?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>On using conflicts to resolve which player gets to decide things, I ran two ideas into each other:<br/>Either state that the rule is always to roll lower on a D10 when ties in stats come up for deciding. Or When something like this comes up, and the players want to contest each other, don't compare stats, instead have a conflict to see which gets his way. </blockquote>\nThe first case is just Counter Rolls which there are already rules for.  The senond could be left as an option, with the first choice the default.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>For the grouping thing, then, are you saying that I can't be part of a group, selecting you as the leader, if I so like? What I did for HQ was to have everybody declare if they wanted to be a leader. If they did not, then they had to declare which leader they were following. So each player decides what team he's on for themselves. </blockquote>\nSee above.  Making this part of declaration makes it easier.  Choose targets, like targets are grouped into sides if the members agree.<br/><br/>As for grouping players into groups with a single leader -- that's fine.  That's the same as just saying they're not making any active Maneuvers this fight.  A follower is basically someone who gives their stats as part of a side, but doesn't do anything on their own.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>- So, for turn order, it's:<br/>- First the engaged characters from high to low.<br/>- Then the disengaged characters from high to low. <br/>Is that it? </blockquote>\nThat's how it used to be.  I like the idea that you just go in order from high to low, regardless of state.  The previous version was a hold over of the 'deal with each fight individually as a single module before moving to the next on' concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141308/#Comment_141308" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T12:24:01+00:00" title="April 25, 2008 12:24PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to suggest one goal per level, but my inner min-maxer came out and said, "Set your goal as crossing the street!"<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about this... you can turn in your advantage points - maybe twenty - to get your goal?

If it's to have a backup weapon, why not carry two spears? </blockquote>\nSince we're abstracting weapons to that point, if sword and spear both use Muscle then there is no reason to have the two skills.  You might as well say you're carrying a giant battle-axe.  It's all color unless it uses a different stat or gives you some other effect.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>If it's the ranged attack argument, then I'll arm myself with a bunch of javelins. A weapon that I can use both as a ranged attack and melee. Weapons all do the same damage, so there's no downside to this, right?</blockquote>\nExcept if Javelin fighting is Agility for both melee and distance (which I would declare it would be).  Then I hit your Agility for Skill Damage and you're screwed in melee.  A fighter who can switch to his sword and use Muscle would have a better time of it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>If you allow this, to make it mechanically sound, you have to be very specific about when the weapon skill can be changed. It might even become important to have a way to determine who gets to declare first. Again, all presupposing we can come up with a mechanical reason that this would ever happen.</blockquote>\nYou define what skill you're fighting with at the beginning of every round, which determines what order you go in.  Everybody declares at the same time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Skill makes you both better at whittling down your opponent, and makes you harder to whittle down. Second, since the bids are relative, there's not a lot of difference no matter what size pool you have.</blockquote>\nYes, there's a double whammy, but considering there's only 10 levels of skill from Mook to Master, I think I'm ok with that level of progression.<br/><br/>Second, from what we have above, bids aren't relative - the most you're going to get on an individual hit is 3 per enemy.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>In your law case example, the lawyer's Law skill determines how well he does, and his Will skill stat determines how long and hard he's willing to fight.</blockquote>\nThis is precisely how the system works now.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the 'battle' in court, we realize that we're fighting with words and that the skill we're using is W:Law.  Our will to fight (how much Kill Damage we can take) IS our Will Stat.<br/><br/>But when I attack you using a Law roll, *I roll against Will*.  They're the same thing.<br/><br/>If I do Skill Damage to you, I'm messing up your ability to be a good lawyer, but not directly attacking your case.  Your *effective* Will (what you use to roll) goes down, but I still have to do Kill Damage equal to you *original* Will value to take you out.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Change the name of Skill Damage to "Stat Damage." Since that's what it is. No?</blockquote>\nWell, yes and no. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'm lowering your effective Stat with regards to how you use it with Skills.  Your Stat stays the same with regards to Kill Damage.<br/><br/>So I'm messing with your Skills - just one Stat at a time, rather than individually.<br/><br/>And I really like the alliteration. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141318/#Comment_141318" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T13:08:26+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  1:08PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [the Alter Battleground maneuver]<br/><br/>I understand the points you're trying to make here.  I would have preferred to leave some mechanical ideas up to the GM/players, but they can always do that anyway.<br/><br/>Here's another way to approach it, using the Item creation rules to leave things open while pinning down mechanical specifics:<br/><br/>Set/Create Trigger <br/><br/>Effect: Create an if-then trigger where the result is an effect from the Item Risk table, and/or the established Risk in Kill or Skill Damage.<br/><br/>Cost: The established Risk<br/><br/>Skills: Any applicable to the situation: P:Observation, P:Scout, and skills such as W:Set Trap, W:Tactics<br/><br/>Success: The trigger is created.<br/><br/>Failure: As above, but the element or its creation somehow works against you, increasing the Advantage of an opposing side in the same conflict by the established Risk.<br/><br/>The "if-then" trigger would be explained as:<br/><br/>A trigger has two parts, a state and an effect.  Example: "If someone enters this area and fails a P:Observation Counter Roll, a one-time trap goes off doing [Risk] Kill damage."  (You could up the number of times it goes off by paying Risk: +1 for each use, according to the Item Risk table).<br/><br/>The trigger for the Psychology roll from the court case would be: "If my side makes a successful Law roll, it can do [Risk] damage to the opposing side in Skill Damage."  (The cost would be 1 for "use of a skill not normally permitted" - basically the assistant is helping the attorney to do something he normally couldn't).<br/><br/>You can set up triggers for bonuses to rolls by scouting out areas: "If anyone makes an Agility-based attack in this area, they get +1 to their Stat."  (Cost of 3 Risk for "+1 on Stat").<br/><br/>The giant boulder trap would cost 3 Risk (+3 Use acts as Area of Effect attack).<br/><br/>I would have a seperate Maneuver called Delay, which would explain what it is seperately (just like Kill and Skill Damage is).  "Funneling" with W:Tactics is a form of Delay.<br/><br/>That would cover all the examples we've spoken of, yes?  And seperate the mechanics cleanly?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>See how important it is to list the actual mechanical effect of a move. Until now I had no idea that people had the optuion to "follow" you. This is mechanically problematic, however. Because how do you get away from people then, if they don't want to let you? Apparently you can't? Or do I misunderstand?</blockquote>\nThe mechanical effects of a Move haven't changed since the last version, and I thought they were clearly enough laid out, but apparently not.<br/><br/>When you Move, everyone fighting you in your immediate area can make a Counter Roll (Agility) to see if they keep with you as you run away.  All of those you beat stay where they are.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Yes, absolutely, the player has to pay the overhead to attempt to get an item. If they don't want to take the repercussions of failure getting the item, then that sunk cost is lost. Otherwise players will just try over and over until they get what they want. There has to be a limit. Once they've squandered their advantage looking for treasure, the orcs are back on their tails, and it's time to address other issues.</blockquote>\nOr, they've found it and it has all sorts of *other* consequences.  Yeah, that was the idea.<br/><br/>[RE: Goals]<br/>Well 'spending Advantage for a goal' is the Advance maneuver.<br/><br/>I was thinking something like a classification of Goals.  Small, medium, and large or the like. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  So many points equals a small goal, etc.  You need so many points to go up.  I think it'd be a multiplier of your level -- the better your are, the more you need to be challenged.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142038/#Comment_142038" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T12:01:48+00:00" title="May  2, 2008 12:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2008 12:02PM by peccable.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't know if anyone's still following this, but...<br/><br/>I'm going to try playtesting the latest [0.0.3] version, based on the feedback I've gotten here.
