Similar to the sorts of exercises that improv/acting troupes do on a regular basis, but I'm specifically interested in those that work best in the context of storygaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431550/#Comment_431550" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-24T12:33:12+00:00" title="April 24, 2014 12:33PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2014 1:16PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, I wasn't saying that wasn't the case. I just think it would be helpful to decide whether you want to consider choosing limited techniques one at a time and mastering them, or to jump in head-first and see what sticks.<br/><br/>Each approach has upsides and downsides!<br/><br/>If there's a third way (other than mixing the two), I'd love to hear about it.<br/><br/>Edit: I'm writing as an artist here (I'm a professional musician), so I'm approaching this from the angle of someone who's serious about improving a new or different skill. I like to alternate very methodical work/practice ("Let's pick an improv scene framing technique, and use it in five different ways until it's second nature") with a looser, jump-into-the-water-until-you-learn-to-swim approach. I think both are very valuable. However, it's very important to agree on which approach you're taking as a group, so you don't miss each other altogether! ("Today, let's throw all our assumptions out the window and try *this thing*." "Tomorrow, we'll play game X as we normally do, except let's all try to be mindful of/experiment with technique Y.")<br/><br/>And I still recommend those two games! Both are 2-3 pages and challenge your improv skills in very different ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431552/#Comment_431552" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-24T13:09:39+00:00" title="April 24, 2014  1:09PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2014 1:10PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about <i>A Penny For My Thoughts</i>?

The whole group clap hands three times and, timed with each clap, say "three things that", then one person turns to the next and says something made up on the spot, like "three movies you like". The next person answers with three things as fast as they can. What they say doesn't have to be true, but it should at least be related to the question, so "Casablanca, Star Wars, Moomin". Is Moomin the title of a film? It doesn't matter. Then you repeat the clapping and "three things that" and the next person say, for example, "three reasons to kill a person". The answer may be "love, hate, jealousy". How do you kill for love? It doesn't matter. The exercise should be completely non-judgmental, and you don't stop and laugh at, or question, any answers. Just keep going around the table, trying to keep the rhythm going. It's important to *not* try to be clever or funny, but to just say the first three things that pops into your mind. The point is to let them out unfiltered, and not care about how they will be received. You can do the same thing without the clapping and just go around the table asking for three things.<br/><br/>The second one is Story Spine; telling a shared story based on specific phrases. One person starts and then the turn moves around the table. The phrases are:<br/><br/>- Once upon a time...<br/>- Every day...<br/>- But, one day...<br/>- Because of that...<br/>- Because of that...<br/>- Because of that... <br/>- Until, finally...<br/>- And, ever since then...<br/><br/>So the first person might say "Once upon a time there was a princess who lived in a castle." The next person continues "Every day she watered the flowers in her garden." The next person continues "But, one day all the flowers were gone!" And so on until all the phrases have been used. It's fun to see what the others come up with, and the phrases make the story follow a dramatic arc. This can give an idea of how to use a similar arc during an RPG session or for a specific player character. More information here: <a href="http://improvencyclopedia.org/games/Story_Spine.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://improvencyclopedia.org/games/Story_Spine.html</a><br/><br/>The third one is Alphabet Game, where you play a scene together where each line of dialog must start on the next letter of the alphabet. You decide a situation, say employees preparing the office Christmas party, and then someone starts with A and you go around the table saying a sentence each:<br/><br/>- And here we are again; same old thing every year.<br/>- But I LOVE the Christmas party!<br/>- See, we can't even agree on whether we like the party or not.<br/><br/>And so on...<br/><br/>I cheated on C; the point is not to be super-strict, but to have fun. When you start talking, you can't go back and start over, so you have to finish the sentence in some way.<br/><br/>To recommend an improv-enabling RPG it has to be <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/17891/InSpectres?manufacturers_id=548&amp;it=1" rel="nofollow">InSpectres</a>. Ten bucks for that game is a steal! I could teach a group the basics of the game, create characters and a ghost hunting franchise, and play a 5-point mission in an hour, if we don't stop and discuss every aspect of the characters. Neither the players nor GM knows the story before it starts. On successful skill rolls the players decide what happens and on failed skill rolls the GM decides. This makes the story a shared improvisation exercise, where you have to build upon what has been established, while you add new wrinkles to the mystery. When you have created the PCs and their franchise it would be easy to run a short 5-point mission before the regular game in future sessions. The risk is of course that InSpectres is so fun it becomes the main event.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431704/#Comment_431704" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T08:58:52+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  8:58AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>To recommend an improv-enabling RPG it has to be <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/17891/InSpectres?manufacturers_id=548&amp;it=1" rel="nofollow">InSpectres</a>.

You can come up with some pretty serious stuff that way if you let the story flow in that direction. Most important bit of advice is, don't plan. Be willing to just let whatever is in your head come out, and trust that it'll be good. It won't always happen, but when it does it's that much better. We'd be about to start an exercise, the 'director' would say "right, have you got an idea? Yes?

But thinking about it <i>did</i> lead me to an idea for an exercise, which is basically to use the game's core mechanic and toss out everything else...<br/><br/>Player 1: tells a memory, stops at the point where she is about to do something decisive<br/>Player 2: says what happened next version 1<br/>Player 3: says what happened next version 2<br/>Player 1 chooses one of those versions and says "yes and..."<br/><br/>I think if we did that exercise a number of times, we would be much more prepared to actually play PFMT!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431737/#Comment_431737" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T06:06:42+00:00" title="April 28, 2014  6:06AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Penny is an odd one, it's basically the "yes and..." exercise you have above, made in to a game and is very much an improv exercise (which I think is mentioned near the back somewhere). The first time I played it we knew nothing about it at all (including the person pitching it) and played it straight from the book. It played well, but long as we were second guessing too much. It's a bit of a victim of its own marketing in my mind as it hides what it is too well. In the games I've played in the UK it's run at around 4 hours in for 4 players, I've not tried it with different numbers.<br/><br/>When I facilitate it I have a print out of the notes from the PDF which I have highlighted for who reads what when. This is pretty simple to do, but helps take out the 'second time round' notes from the middle of what you have to read which is handy. I also like how this document is becoming an artefact in its own right as it ages from repeated, if occasional, use. You could just do this to the book, but I hate writing in books...<br/><br/>To stop the second guessing situation we ended up in first time, and to emphasise the nature of the game I have also written an intro letter from the doctor in charge giving the players a little bit more information as to what is happening (largely, trust the game, it's not a trick).<br/><br/>Finally, be aware that because it's based on 'yes and' it actually gives players carte blanche to be dicks if they are so inclined. While the version 1, version 2 stage gives you the out that one of the players is going to suggest something you are interested in, the memory trigger stage allows players to just outright state things that you are supposed to run with and add to. You know your players, which is a good start, and it sounds like they won't revel in making other players uncomfortable. But if there's any doubt, this is probably a game where the X card would make a lot of sense (rather than a lines and veils approach).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431765/#Comment_431765" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T14:02:54+00:00" title="April 28, 2014  2:02PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2014 2:03PM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>... but I'm not sure I'd suggest 'Whose Line Is It Anyway' /.../ because they were much more likely to be instantly funny.<br/><br/>/.../<br/>Most important bit of advice is, don't plan.

The best ones are not from a TV studio, but from a theater stage. It's even better if it's an improv course group performing and not professionals, because it's easier to see what they're doing when they're not super quick thinking and totally synchronized. It's refreshing to see an actor go totally blank and then find something to say that keeps the scene moving. In Who's Line, even when they go blank you almost think that they're acting, because they're so good.<br/><br/>You probably need some understanding about improv basics ("say yes", and so on), but as long as you keep reminding yourself that they haven't planned anything it's quite amazing what a group of people can come up with on the spot. Sometimes there's a hidden structure about who sets the scenes or which characters return in which scenes, but the actual content when two or more people are on stage is of course created on the spot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua" title="Joshua"><img alt="Joshua" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joshua">Joshua</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431962/#Comment_431962" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-02T05:05:45+00:00" title="May  2, 2014  5:05AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Games-Actors-Non-Actors-2nd-Edition/dp/0415267080" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Games-Actors-Non-Actors-2nd-Edition/dp/0415267080</a><br/><br/>All of Augusto Boal's works are challenging and good for developing powerful improvisational muscles.
