There are phases for adding technology, organizations, and philosophies and connecting them together in weird ways. This is one formula for a post-modern cyberpunk setting. Every playtest I have ever run has produced a setting that had cyberpunk flavor.<br/><br/>What drives me is how ideas bang into each other in the dark in cyberpunk literature, with a heavy dosage of paranoia and conspiracy poured on top.<br/><br/>The rules for play also encourage players to use things in the setting as tools.

(Ben Lehman had a neat hack for Empathy: you used it for the characters mentioned in your lifepath. That meant that Empathy wasn't a cybernetics tank that you used up, but an actually useful thing that, as you used it, you found yourself relying on "Cool" more than "Emp".

But here goes.<br/>\n<blockquote>- The example for a technology has detail that is disallowed when creating character names. Why? Is there something that could be changed in how one or the other is built to create a better network?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure what section you're referencing. Can you tell me explicitly what you're talking about? Do you mean the examples in the Overview chapter?<br/><br/>If you mean the "just names, not titles or roles" rule, that is intended to prevent creating implicit relationships within a single node. "Bali Logan, CEO of Megasoft" implies two nodes ("Bali Logan" and "Megasoft") and relationships ("runs" or "leads" or "employs"). Since the game is about changing and using relationships, you want to avoid hiding relationships in a node's name.<br/>\n<blockquote>- you might want to suggest safety words under Determine Limits in the Compile section</blockquote>\nI don't think that's necessary, but maybe. People don't need to say "red" or "safeword" or "aardvark" to get fellow players to stop doing something that bothers them. Safewords are useful in BDSM play largely so that you can safely yell "No!" and "Stop!" without meaning it, and because the level of risk is higher than normal sexual activity and needs absolutely clear signals not just to enforce trust, but to build it. I would only consider adding safewords to the rules as a means of building additional trust, but I don't have much faith that it'd work in an RPG the same way it works in the bedroom.\n<blockquote>- you rely on examples from cyberpunk literature to inspire people, but I wonder if a few guiding questions might be a better way to get people working on ideas</blockquote>\nProbably. I've been concentrating mainly on getting the core rules to work before fine tuning. The finished thing, whenever that happens, will have tons of examples and lots more play advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205302/#Comment_205302" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T05:25:05+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  5:25AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2009 5:25AM by madunkieg.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><br/>I have to admit I'm surprised to see you derail your own thread this way!

Neuromancer, which essentially defined the genre, was written 25 years ago, and was a speculation on how a worldwide network of computers would impact society.  Now, a quarter-century later, we actually have examples of how these things work.<br/><br/>Especially considering the relatively recent focus on "Web 2.0"; that is, websites that focus on user-created content, as opposed to the static pages of yesteryear.  So, we've got everything from YouTube and it's recent symphony orchestra, to 4chan's Anonymous and their Scientology protests.  These things are in some ways completely different, and in other ways exactly the same, as the ideas presented in the cyberpunk genre.  Anonymous, for example, reminds me of the Panther Moderns from Neuromancer: just as chaotic and unpredictable, but less violent, and with a certain sense of righteousness.<br/><br/>So while I'm not designing a cyberpunk game, methinks that any new cyberpunk literature would probably have to take into account the current state of things, if it didn't want to feel "retro".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205324/#Comment_205324" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T07:44:20+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  7:44AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that what I'm working on is really cyberpunk, but it's close.<br/><br/>Twenty to twenty-five years ago when cyberpunk was really strong as a movement, it looked to our current era with a eye toward a dystopian future with high technology and corporate monopolies rather than nationalistic governments.<br/><br/>In a way, we're living in that world. My game reflects our current world with advanced technologies and ancient belief paradigms fighting to control reality while the mortal masses are fighting back through reality television and freedom of information through the internet.<br/><br/>The characters within this game take on the roles of modern day corporate sponsored heroes fighting against supernatural criminals and paranormal forces of nature, while trying to avoid the paparazzi and their fanatical fans.<br/><br/>Twenty years ago it would have been an interesting Shadowrun campaign, now it's just reality with a supernatural twist.<br/><br/>Posting up what I've done on this game has been a slow and ongoing process over the last couple of weeks, getting the game to it's current point has taken a few months (because I'm working on a companion comic for it at the same time).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205332/#Comment_205332" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T08:24:08+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  8:24AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see the original Cyberpunk movement as suburban white kid reaction to the Eighties. Government was sorta too clean to be that clean, then Iran-Contra showed us the reality. Computers were moving out of the white rooms and into the living room. A kid could own a computer. The Cold War was ending and Balkanization was starting. Corporations were getting more powerful and less regulated (and more deregulated). It was a bizarre time and I think it had a profound effect on fiction. You cannot discount Philip K. Dick's influence on the genre, either, though he's usually classified as science fiction. Dick's largest contributions to Cyberpunk are paranoia, distrust of reality (or altered states), and the megacorp.<br/><br/>During the mid- to late-Nineties, Cyberpunk seemed sorta trite and quaint. Life was pretty good in the suburbs. The genre sorta went to sleep for a while, though it had a sort of second life as Hollywood discovered PKD's short stories in the early 2000's.<br/><br/>I think the last two Bush terms caused a resurgence in Cyberpunk interest. Corporations are bigger than ever -- and imploding. The government was more Big Brother than ever (can you say "extreme rendition" or "fiber optic wiretapping"?). Technology continues to advance at a mind-blowing rate.

I also used to be very dissatisfied with cyberpunk rpgs. To me the characters were all corporate sellouts, not punks. The problem was, there was little the genre had to offer in terms of alternatives, so the best characters could be were rebels without a clue.<br/><br/>That's where neo-tribalism comes in (these are not like the tribes of <i>Cyberpunk v3</i>). There is often a cultural influence in cyberpunk, with the Japanese being a big inspiration, but for a variety of reasons I think that tribal cultures are more relevant than ever. We face a growing awareness of the world, but when faced with this mass-scale community, more and more people are turning to or creating smaller scale communities, something on the scale where people feel they can matter again. These communities often start from the most insignificant of social practices that overcome minor life inconveniences, as minor as borrowing and lending novels. The social ties reinforce a sense of personal worth (someone tells you they liked the book you lent them) and the ethics behind the practice (such as sharing) expand to other parts of life, at least within the trusted micro-community. At some point the group gains a sense of identity. What you've just built is a neo-tribe.<br/><br/>I also look at how technology is starting to change. Chips in various items, even clothing, make them "smart." Cellphones leave people talking to themselves. We sit down and search the internet for information and wisdom. Computers are controlled by software, the specialized realm of programming languages and programmers who may even interfere with the lives of others by damaging the data a person relies upon. Animism. Channelling. Dreamwalking. Shamanism and curses. Tribal metaphors can provide ways of functioning within an increasingly complicated technological world, in part because they're used to dealing with the idea of an invisible world beyond our own. It's just that technology has made this superstition into a reality.<br/><br/>Speaking of technology, 80s cyberpunk heralded the hacker, someone who had the ability to crack the locks sealing information away. 00s cyberpunk heralds the researcher, someone who can sift through all the data that is freely out there to find the relevant pieces and put them together (much like bloggers), which is more of a social, rather than technical practice. The other individual of importance is the media pirate, someone who engages in the sharing of media, a social practice rooted in sharing oral stories, but one that disrupts economic practice. As liberal capitalism struggles to find ways of understanding and describing the social patterns around these, other cultures have an opportunity to step in with their understandings.<br/><br/>Of course, punk had a streak of primitivist revivalism in it, both aesthetic and, for some people, practical, so it all ties back in, except this time the punk isn't just a rebel, this time the punks can rebuild the world, not in a new image, but in a diversity of images. The cyber is a way to connect the characters to the world of data. The old cyberpunk was dystopian, but the new cyberpunk is much more satirical of its corporate tyrants, and much more hopeful to boot.<br/><br/>This is all very fragmented, I know, but I wanted to keep the post to less than twenty pages. It's also only a fraction of the ideas I'm sifting through right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Since Shock is out of print and probably no copies exist within 200km, it will likely be Verge. I also know that the world-built-on-the-fly approach held in common by those games is pretty much the opposite of what I want to do with my project, which will offer a very detailed setting.<br/><br/>(I tried to take a bit of time before editing this post to expand upon that last statement, as my knee-jerk reactions can sometimes emphasize the jerk.)<br/><br/>I see pre-written setting as one more mind, the game designer's, contributing to making the gameplay fun. It's a way to bring well refined ideas into the story when the speed of gameplay doesn't allow you the time to refine your own ideas. I even find a good, detailed setting inspiring; those ideas I do come up with on the fly are a lot better than when I only have a few vague bits to inspire me. By taking the time to build and refine a detailed setting, I can make the story more subtle, more complex, and I know I've got good resources to fall back upon when the story gets tricky. That's something I think is necessary for the incredible diversity I'm going to try to evoke in this project.<br/><br/>So, while I may appreciate what Verge and Shock attempt to do, I don't foresee using anything like them to do the game design I'm going to attempt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205809/#Comment_205809" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T17:34:07+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  5:34PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2009 6:01PM by madunkieg.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vulpinoid</cite>I don't know that what I'm working on is really cyberpunk, but it's close...</blockquote>\nYour ideas certainly hold some themes in common with cyberpunk. I get the image of <i>Mystery Men</i> in my head when I read what you've got in mind, but <i>SLA Industries</i> might be a closer match. That game was definitely a love/hate relationship for me; I loved some of the ideas and feeling it put forth, but I hated its execution.<br/><br/>What made you decide the corporate hero was the way to go?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205846/#Comment_205846" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T22:00:34+00:00" title="May  6, 2009 10:00PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite><br/>What made you decide the corporate hero was the way to go?</blockquote>\nThe game has a strong connection to the current reality television vibe happening. I don't know what things are like over in the US (or around the rest of the world for that matter), but I'd imagine things are pretty similar to Australia in this regard.<br/><br/>You sit down to watch a bit of TV at night and half the shows are game shows or some type of reality television (Big Brother, Idol, So You Think You Can Dance, Televised Sport, Home Makeover Shows, People Makeover Shows, the original reality TV show "Cops" and it's various spin offs that focus on the trials and tribulations of a specific profession).<br/><br/>A decent chunk of the rest are cop shows or some type of forensic/investigative drama (whether medical, crime scene, or something similar).<br/><br/>Many of the remainder are sitcoms or teen-drama but that's not what I'm interested in.<br/><br/>What grabbed my attention was the real development of the reality TV genre over the last couple of years. I was actually watching our national television awards the other night with my wife and was fascinated by the fact that a few years ago no one would have considered a non-scripted television show as worthy of an award. The news and current affairs programming was noteworthy and had the potential to be awarded, but that was something quite different; it was serious, not pre-packaged entertainment. Then a single award for reality TV was awarded for a couple of years, and this year there seemed to be three or four awards for different types of reality contest, light reality entertainment, best reality presenter...<br/><br/>I've been thinking of this growth of the phenomenon for a while. Personally I think most of these TV shows are crap and I'd rather create my own entertainment than watch something like this (hence I game), but there's no denying the presence that these shows are having on western culture. It seemed that the most newsworthy story in the English speaking world a few weeks ago was the lady singer from "Britain's Got Talent" with the looks of a demon and the voice of an angel. Just a regular person who had the guts to take a risk and get exposed on international television in the process.  <br/><br/>It reminds me of the "Rockerboys" and the "Medias" in Cyberpunk 2020. Character concepts that were often ignored in many of the sessions I played, but in the modern world they are the true heroes to the people.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say that these individuals are deserving of the hero status, but they are idolised by millions and easily become the focus of office banter and teenage adoration. If they link to a sponsor, then that sponsor's products gain recognition (even if it's only through hype). If they choose to associate themselves with a charity, then everyone suddenly thinks it's fashionable to sponsor a child, save a puppy or recycle their old CRT television...<br/><br/>I'm fascinated by the spin. Especially when the whole western world has become so enamoured with it that they didn't realise the financial crisis was on it's way. <br/><br/>At one level the game is about the use and abuse of people. Corporations trying to hook into the next big thing, they make a media superstar, burn them out and then move onto the next one.<br/><br/>At another level its about people trying to use the power they're given to make a stand for the right reasons. They know that their fame comes from revealing the supernatural truth of the world, but they also know that most people think it's only a TV show. They are risking life and limb for a bit of fame, glory and hopefully enough money to retire...the jaded citizens of the world see them as glorified sports heroes and actors (a la Gladiators, or WCW wrestlers)...the teenagers see heartthrobs and sex-kittens.<br/><br/>Too long I've seen roleplaying portray the underdog, the outcaste, the rebel. What if we could portray the troubles that a company insider faces? Characters who spend one scene killing demons, the next scene justifying to their boss how they damaged the company APC, and the next scene explaining to their wife why they didn't make it home last night (again).<br/><br/>The characters will burn out quickly in this game, unless they've got something strong to hold onto, a belief structure, a moral integrity, an inner truth. But the harder they hold onto this stabilising influence, the more complicated it will make their lives.<br/><br/>Mystery Men was definitely one of the early concept models for the game, especially the corporate logos scattered across Captain Amazing's uniform. But as indicated in the "What are you working on?" thread, some of the stronger influences come from David Mack's Kabuki, the cult TV show Max Headroom, current trends in reality television and even the Guide to the Technocracy expansion book for Mage:the Ascension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
