This will be a barebones account, as so much happened. As the GM, I only see your Goals, etc., after the fact. I'd like to know how you all planned and plotted to carry them through.<br/><br/>This game had a fairly high body count. But that wasn't what made it sad. 2 PC's died, 1 NPC, and as a result of the death of one of the NPC's, one PC just lost all will to continue.<br/><br/>The story took place in New Orleans, around 1800.<br/><br/>Our cast of characters:<br/>Plymouth (played by Mark), born in New Orleans, about 15 years old, a cooper, son of the wine merchant, believes in spirits and oaths, speaks his mouth too often, and viewed as a turncoat. His Goals were to "Establish an Underground Railroad", and to "Become a Conjurer"<br/><br/>Camille (played by Joe), born in Shreveport, about 35 yrs old, a cook. Bilingual in French and English, she had burns all over her, she was an awesome cook, and she had twin daughters whom she hadn't seen since they were toddlers.<br/>Her goals were to "Establish an Escape Route" (in order to run off with her children), and to "Marry Phillipe", a young slave who worked with Plymouth.<br/><br/>Coal (played by Dave), born in Africa, in his 50's. He was the blacksmith and the conjurer. He had only one eye, his owner (correctly) thought he was a trouble maker, other slaves feared and respected him, he was a real conjurer, and he looked about 30. His Goals were to "Establish an Escape Network", and to "Convert Rebecca". <br/><br/>Rebecca (played by Daniel), also born in Africa, about 45 years old, a midwife who worked for a doctor. She knew stories for children (both African and European), couldn't read, other slaves thought she knew magic, but she just knew herbs to help with childbirth, her owner told her she was old and ugly, and every time she helped a white child, she thought she should strangle it, but then she fell in love with it. Her Goals were to "Establish an Underground Railroad", and "Convert my Fellow Slaves."<br/><br/>Ned (played by Dan), a carriage driver, "middle aged", born in Jamaica. The master believed him to be slow, he was afraid of returning to the plantation, but longed to escape, the father of two sons, both sold away, and superstitious. His Goals were to "Establish an Escape Route", and "Get Plymouth Sold to Mississippi".<br/><br/>As you see, they all had a common goal, which never panned out, but steered the story. I didn't pick up on it until about halfway through the story.<br/><br/>Some NPC's of note:<br/>Philippe, about 21 years old, a slave<br/>Robert Soileau, Philippe's free cousin<br/>George Lirette, a French man with too much money and time on his hands. Lirette liked to try new things, like start a rice plantation and a hair salon/brothel, and he saw the slaves as ants in an ant farm. He liked to stir the sand and watch them run around.<br/><br/>More in a sec.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123463/#Comment_123463" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T13:11:54+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  1:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about running all SAJ convention games with lots of supernatural elements. The supernatural serves as a good emotional buffer for the potential brutality, and it's more universally "fun". Then I play games like this, and I reconsider. In this game, the magic was only real to the characters.<br/><br/>I'm going to give my observations more than the story (sorry, I'm really bad with details!). The best scenes were between the PC's. Their masters, other than Charles Lirette, had little to do in their every day lives until it came to punishment. Because the setting was in a city, they all came from different households, and they had more freedom of movement than slaves on a plantation would. <br/><br/>Incidents of note: Ned successfully badmouthed Plymouth enough that he was punished by branding. His master got carried away, and killed him. Coal died by an anvil falling on his head. He never convinced Rebeccah that his root magic was real. <br/><br/>Characters lent their worth to help others in conflicts. I love when people do this. <br/><br/>And why this was the saddest SAJ ever. Charles Lirette made a deal with Camille that he would find her children. He made good on his deal, but he waited until he had established his hair salon/brothel before he told her. When he finally brought Camille to the shop and introduced them, the girls didn't recognize Camille, so we rolled a Major Conflict to determine if she could convince them that she was their mother. Rebeccah, the midwife, who had occasion to talk to Camille about her children lent a hand to Camille. Camille rolled against one daughter, who helped the other not to recognize (both NPC's, so Joe rolled against me.) First it was a tie. We rolled the skull dice. One more tie. We rolled it again. I rolled the skull. The daughter died, and did not recognize her mother.<br/><br/>The table went terribly quiet.  I had never met any of the players before, some I'd chatted online with, but I was afraid I had crossed the line of fun. I wanted to ask Joe if he was okay, he looked so upset. And this is why I didn't want to play games without the supernatural. I personally like to play high emotion games, where really sad things happen and affect me, but I know not everyone plays that way. As far as I can tell, the other players were on the same high emotional level as me. Whew! That moment was one of the best gaming experiences I've had. As the designer of the game, it was validation of sorts, that the subject matter *and* mechanics are playable and fun. So yay for me.<br/><br/>But really, yay for the players for creating characters they cared about, and for taking the risk to play them fully knowing that they could die with a roll of the die.<br/><br/>I hope Mark, Joe, Dave, Daniel, and Dan will jump in and talk about their characters and how the game went for them. Thank you guys, for playing and making my day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123487/#Comment_123487" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T14:30:00+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  2:30PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

Wow.</blockquote>\nI like to think of it that way, too.<br/><br/>John, you bring up an interesting point. I first met you playing Land of 1000 Kings, and the next day we played an incredibly intense game of Poison'd. There was a similar tension and cohesion between the players in that Poison'd game in this SAJ game. Both games were really only as sucessful as the engagement and participation of the players. At the end of both games, despite their harshness, I felt like I had experienced something intimate and positive with the players. <br/><br/>I asked the players how much supernatural they wanted, and where they drew the line (violence against women and children). I tried to warn then that when magic isn't real, the brutality has no filter. They were okay with that, although one player wanted a little more supernatural. I suggested that the magic for his character could be real. <br/><br/>IIRC when Coal died, Dave decided to play his ghost, which allowed him only to lend his dice in conflicts. <br/><br/>Here are some of the "happier" things. The PC's acted in community. There were enemies and allies, and the players utilized their relationships to try to get their needs met and desires fulfilled.<br/><br/>Charles Lirette, perhaps as a reflection of how I, as GM, was affected by Camille's loss, freed his slaves, including the surviving sister. He financed her move to France. He also treated Camille with respect and dignity (he was leasing her).<br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD: Another happy thing--Dave gave me an awesome die, which totally needs to be used as a SAJ house rule: A red die with the state of Alabama as the 1 pip. It's a perfect alternative to the skull die. Roll it, and you're automatically sold to someone down in Alabama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123504/#Comment_123504" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T15:23:22+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  3:23PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>It even jars with the word "play"; I should probably say "face" or "experience".</blockquote>\nThanks for that.

For me, actually, what really put the hook in was after the daughter had died, Joe decided that Camille didn't care whether or not the other daughter recognized him any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that may only have come out partially at the table, but that I think tied into the emotional resonance for all of us, was that we'd come to consensus that we wanted family issues to play a fairly large role.  Not only did Camille have the lost daughters plot, but a big part of the motivation for Rebecca to try to help set up an underground railroad was to keep slave families together.  Speaking only for me, I've got a daughter on the way, so it's on my mind - and the whole notion of losing someone that has already started to rearrange my whole life and set of priorities... well, it really struck me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can chime in with my *other* favorite scenes, though they pale compared to the Camille scene...<br/>\n<br/>\nDave and I got the first death die roll-off during a scene where Coal was trying to put a (beneficial!) spell on Rebecca - it wasn't initially shaping up to be a huge scene, I don't think, but escalated very quickly into a real spiritual/ideological battle.  Part of what made it sing for me was that Dave had done such a good job leading up to it bringing Rebecca around to recognizing that, though possibly a Satanist (in her mind), he wasn't such a bad guy and really cared about helping the others escape.  We ended up with a pretty tense scene of both of them staring at each other, Rebecca chanting her rosary, and then Coal falling over dead from the stress - and naming her his successor as conjurer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also really liked a little scene that Rebecca had with Plymouth, trying to convince him that he should accept Jesus' forgiveness and then the community would forgive him for his perceived transgressions.  Actually, both Rebecca and Coal placed a tremendous amount of faith in Plymouth's basic goodness... Of course, at the end, to escape being punished, he ratted us all out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver" title="Dave Cleaver"><img alt="Dave Cleaver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dscleaver.googlepages.com/avatar_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver">Dave Cleaver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123574/#Comment_123574" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T20:43:51+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  8:43PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel Levine</cite>Of course, at the end, to escape being punished, he ratted us all out.</blockquote>\nOh I had forgotten about that. I really wanted Plymouth to do well. Also, the way Joe played Camille made me empathize with her almost immediately. That made it extra hard when the world came crashing down around her. <br/><br/>I set out to make Coal very selfish and out for his own personal gain. None of that really came out strongly in play, and I think it all worked out for the best. I wonder what would have happened between him and Rebecca, if we had dragged their issues with each other across a few more scenes. As it is I think we were aware of the short time frame and so we really drove for the heart of the stories. It was the kind of game that I really get a lot of satisfaction from, and it was a great start to the weekend.<br/><br/>P.S. - As much as I would love to take credit, I didn't give you an awesome die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123577/#Comment_123577" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T21:33:55+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  9:33PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2008 9:35PM by Parthenia.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Cleaver</cite>P.S. - As much as I would love to take credit, I didn't give you an awesome die.</blockquote>\nYou didn't?

I'm glad it didn't shy away from the pathos because I'd've never gotten over the touchy anxiety about it with a light-hearted game. Now I feel confident I'd recommend it to people.<br/><br/>I played Plymouth. I enjoyed pretty much everything about the character in the fact that he was a great engine of emotional highs and lows. I planned him to be manipulated from the beginning and everyone jumped in as necessary (although I don't think I had a single scene with Joe's character). I also knew at the end that I'd earned enough cred to betray everyone there and not feel dickish about it.<br/><br/>Julia: I think the greatest thing about this game is unfortunately where you aren't present. Our planning session at the beginning was an awesome way to really get a chance to help set up our situations to maximum effectiveness. With more play, I could see a group doing some rapid fire set up. (Side note: Another great thing is how the scene framing was really tight; you could watch your plans crumble before your eyes. I'd encourage people to roll with it and change their goals as necessary. I hope that the way we played is how it is recommended in the book.) The neat thing about the planning is that when we took a break (and all the male players went to the bathroom simultaneously) we were able to plan anew and keep the pacing and knife-twisting at a frenetic pace. Julia - this halfway point reincorporation of the planning session was truly golden. I'd recommend it be available to the table whenever they want, but maybe not too often.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for giving time to bring such a great event to bear.

Our planning session at the beginning was an awesome way to really get a chance to help set up our situations to maximum effectiveness. With more play, I could see a group doing some rapid fire set up. (Side note: Another great thing is how the scene framing was really tight; you could watch your plans crumble before your eyes. I'd encourage people to roll with it and change their goals as necessary. I hope that the way we played is how it is recommended in the book.)</blockquote>\nThat's not unfortunate, that's awesome! The plotting without the GM is really important. The GM is meant to be the outsider, and she can plan her own agenda or roll with the players. I didn't have much of an agenda for this session. For the previous sessions I did (including a plot and a mystery to solve), and both ways worked.<br/><br/>Yeah, you are encouraged to change your goals where needed. I think I bring up the fact a few times that the GM doesn't know what you want, so you have to seize the moments when you can.<br/><br/>Mark, the last scene where Ned stood at Plymouth's grave and talked about losing his children just rocked, and brought everything full circle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123750/#Comment_123750" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T11:36:27+00:00" title="February  1, 2008 11:36AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True.

Ned's motivation was actually a last-minute inspiration--before then, my character's desire to see his sons again didn't seem to fit with what he was really doing. And honestly, I wouldn't have gone for it if you hadn't been so willing to play Plymouth as such a fallible character.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn SAJ, I think it was a good idea ultimately to play down the supernatural, and if I played it again, I would want to do it that way again. I can understand why your average dungeon crawl shies away from emotionally sticky issues, but a game about slavery should freaking be about slavery. I think initially I was afraid that unvarnished, the brutality would lead to four hours of victimization, which I don't think anybody would enjoy; but I didn't realize how goal-oriented the PCs would be, which really makes the game work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
