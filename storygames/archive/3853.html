However, my original question stands: What, in a political/social/intrigue LARP is better handled with rules than without them? Even given that the purpose of the LARP is not necessarily immersion?

We're taking kind of a narrativist approach:  each player has authority over her character, but also receives a set number of Story tokens at the start of the game.  If a player wants something to happen in the story that affects something other than her character, she spends a Story token. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, Biff the football player wants to pin Jackson, the shifty loner, to a wall so he can force answers out of him.  Biff's player spends a Story token, now Jackson is pinned.  Nice and simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, this will only work well if you clearly define the limits of what a player can do.  For instance, you can spend a Story token to knock someone out or immobilize them for a scene, but you couldn't spend a token to kill someone.  Or you can spend a token to find a clue or add a useful prop to the game: "Look guys, I found a bloody knife under Biff's bed!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tricky bit is when two players want different things to happen.  Our solution is, you can't just spend a token to simply say, "No, that doesn't happen."  Spending a token gives the player a brief moment of absolute authority.  To change an unfavorable situation, you have to embellish on the situation.  For instance, for Jackson to escape Biff, Jackson's player might spend a token and say, "The lights suddenly go out!  I escape in the confusion!"  Further, you can't spend a token to do the same thing twice, so the next time Biff comes across Jackson, he'll have to think of a new approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
