The show's original intent as described in this series bible reminds me of a session of Dogs.<br/><br/><b>2.</b> I've run Dogs 100+ times for 200+ different people and I still love it. But after 2-3 intense sessions, many players retire their characters by using fallout to burn their "I'm a Dogs" Trait or Relationship (which is why i suspect it's mandatory to have one). Most players I've run for enjoy playing but it has a limited shelf life for them. I know many of those 200+ players are also BSG fans, so I'm excited by the idea of going back and running Dogs for them again in a new way.<br/><br/><b>How?</b><br/><br/>- Town = Ship<br/>- Cylons = Demons, Possessed People, Sorcerers <br/>- Conflicts are less about "demons" and more how people react under pressure<br/>- The "Dogs" are people without the required leadership experience elevated to ultimate power as decision makers who must make sharp judgements to keep everything together when there is no time and the only hope they have is the hope they bring.<br/><br/><b>Thoughts?</b><br/><br/>Has anyone done this? Or how would you?<br/><br/>I've only run Dogs for Dogs. Never re-skinned it for anything else. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310385/#Comment_310385" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T09:09:56+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  9:09AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BSG is mostly the same relationships over and over, rather than the "planet of the week" of Star Trek.

Dogs strikes me as, essentially, episodic in nature: how do the characters come to grips with their own understanding of their place in the world by exposure to the problems of this town, that town, and that other town over there. The game seems to come pre-rolled with the understanding that the only really explicit links between the situations described by any two "adventures" are the PC/Dogs themselves. If you want to take a TV-SciFi series and Dogs-i-fy it, then it seems to me that you're looking more at Star Trek or Farscape as more likely models.<br/><br/>But I suspect that Apocalypse World is ideally suited to the BSG setup. There is no central authority in the background; there is no "place to repair to for comfort and replenishment". The world has fallen to hell in a hand basket; most near everyone is dead; you pathetic train of survivors are being dogged by a poorly understood and seemingly implacable foe; and, of course, "something weird" is going on that's not really rationally explainable.<br/><br/>I suspect it wouldn't be hard at all to BSG-ify the player's sheets/moves, and some characters leap out as nearly auto-translating:<br/><br/>Angel == Doc Cottle, Fours<br/>Battle Babe == Starbuck, Sixes<br/>Brainer == Baltar Six, Twos<br/>Chopper == Chief, Helo<br/>Driver == Lee Adama, Eights<br/>Gun Lugger == Anders?<br/>Hard Holder == Bill Adama, Ones<br/>Hocus == Roslin, Baltar, Zarek, Ones<br/>Operator == Gaeta, Ellen Tigh, Tory, Fives, Threes<br/>Savvy Head == Chief, Cally<br/>Skinner == ?

Or PTA for a less rules / prep heavy game.<br/><br/>For my personal goal, I'm thinking I would run a 1-2 shot game that would deal with "a day in the life of BSG". We would start in the middle of the action and deal with the repercussions of their situation. You would have a ship where there is a problem. Maybe someone is a Cylon? Or pro-cylon? Or thinks they can do a better job running the ship? Or is using the misfortune of the situation to profit? Or wants to giveup? Or wants to launch a full out suicidal war? Or thinks we're heading in the wrong direction... away from earth? Or disagreements on how to deal with supply shortages? Or corrupt leadership? People are victimized. Victims lash out. People break into sides. And the cylons inch closer.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>Who would the characters be?

I'm thinking just like Dogs are teenage virgins with minimal life experience and ultimate power entrusted to them... the main characters would be decision makers that normally wouldn't be making these decisions... a school teacher, a retired military person, a drunk, a specialist who's morally questionable but we need their skills... put in charge because there is no other choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310396/#Comment_310396" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T10:50:16+00:00" title="February  1, 2011 10:50AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>BSG is mostly the same relationships over and over, rather than the "planet of the week" of Star Trek.

I suspect Smallville would work as well or possibly better. But for my purposes neither work unfortunately.<br/><br/>I'm specifically looking to run 1-2 shot games and many of the players in question are already familiar with and like Dogs. That said, if a system does not fit the premise, even if the players have familiarity, I wouldn't use it. But I'm thinking (possibly wrongly) that Dogs can fit. Especially after reading the BSG series bible. <br/><br/>That said, I think Apocalypse World would make for a fun take on BSG from a different and possibly really cool perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310404/#Comment_310404" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T11:12:58+00:00" title="February  1, 2011 11:12AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sticking with using BSG to play DitV - (AW sounds really good, too, though - but it might require more work reskinning, adjusting custom moves and gear...?)<br/><br/>So ... different Battlestar, separate from the BSG fleet?<br/>Or ... your dogs are on a different ship in the BSG fleet?<br/><br/>I'd probably go different Battlestar with its own tiny rag-tag fleet.

Even relatively low-ranking officers like Starbuck (a lieutenant, right? It's been awhile) were entrusted with responsibilities that they probably wouldn't have been during the normal course of duty. The higher ranking officers were also somewhat compromised in terms of authority -- not a lot of characters on the show were conspicuous about wanting Colonel Tigh to make their decisions for them. Galactica wasn't a plum assignment in the fleet. I'd say keep the ranks relatively low, and work in various possible backgrounds (e.g. regular military just joined before the attack, regular military that had been on the slow track serving time till retirement, reactivated veteran, fresh recruit from the civilian fleet). Various combos of age, rank, officer/enlisted, etc. could muddy the waters enough that players aren't eager to buckle under to the technical chain of command.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I'm not sure if faith ends up being the fruitful void in most of our Dogs games.

I'm surprised that's not spelled out more clearly in the Bible, because for me that's what the show was About.<br/><br/>The fundamental concern in BSG is survival.  The moral question is this:  What is worth sacrificing in order to survive?  The Dogs are the characters like Lee Adama, Starbuck, Billy, and Tyrol, who are officers, crewman, or civilians given the authority to intervene in the affairs of ships in the fleet to keep it flying.  Their job is to go into places where there are problems and fix them.  They have the authority to, if necessary, draw a gun and shoot the troublemaker, but no one wants to let things get that far.<br/><br/>The really interesting thing about the ladder of sin in DitV is that, often, the players decide that, in some cases, some level of sin is okay.  That's exactly what happens all the time in BSG.<br/><br/>BSG isn't really about finding Cylons.  Any rules that focus too much on the cylons really lose out on the appeal of BSG, I think.<br/><br/>In this fleet, all we can do is survive.  We keep going and jumping and looking for some place called Earth that may or may not even exist.<br/><br/>But something's wrong.<br/><br/>Someone LOSES PERSPECTIVE.  They forget that the needs of the fleet outweigh anything else and that nothing matters more than the survival of the human race.  They start to think that their personal needs, or tradition, or democracy, or comfort, or anything else, come before the needs of the fleet.<br/><br/>This leads to...<br/><br/>IRRESPONSIBLE ACTIONS.  They start to act out these unrealistic feelings.  They withhold fuel shipments.  They riot.  They demand that the president resign and hold immediate elections.  They show up to fly a watch drunk.  In some way, they interrupt the necessary operations within the fleet.<br/><br/>These interruptions lead to fleet to being exposed to...<br/><br/>Cylon Attacks.  The halts to smooth operations distracts the fleet and leaves it vulnerable enough for the Cylons to make some kind of attack, whether that means raiders, terrorist attacks from sleepers in the fleet, or other threats.  These, like Demonic Attacks in regular DitV, shouldn't really take center stage.  They happen and are resolved, but it's mostly about avoiding and recovering from them.  They should more be backdrop for what the characters do.<br/><br/>Eventually, these attacks, the worsening situation, and these bad beliefs lead to...<br/><br/>UNHEALTHY PHILOSOPHIES.  These ill-advised beliefs become well-formed coded.  Feelings about fairness lead to demands for labor benefits and a true representative government.  Desire for control become assertions that individual ship captains, not the Commander, decide where to go and how to fly.  These doctrines are incompatible with smooth operations of the fleet and can lead to disaster.  Weariness over running from the Cylons leads to beliefs that Human-Cylon peace is possible<br/><br/>Left unchecked, individuals become RENEGADE LEADERS.  They attract followers and destroy their resolve with their poisonous thoughts.  They make problems even worse.<br/><br/>Eventually, these splinter groups gain enough power and contemplate...<br/><br/>CESSATION.  The splinter group grows large enough to take control of one or more ships and threatens to leave the fleet, making themselves and the fleet itself weaker.<br/><br/>The scale of escalation is essentially the same as regular DitV.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310499/#Comment_310499" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T18:09:41+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  6:09PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brenton, you're awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310503/#Comment_310503" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T18:44:35+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  6:44PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2011 6:46PM by Deliverator.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How to keep 100% not being a Cylon exclusive to the PCs?<br/><br/>Easy... the testing equipment is incredibly fragile and bulky and cannot be removed from the Galactica aka Central Falls.  :-)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310505/#Comment_310505" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T18:50:21+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  6:50PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooooh, in fact!!!!

In terms of traits, it isn't useful like "I'm a Dog" because the majority of NPCs aren't cylons either (from their own perspective) so they won't be impressed by the PCs not being cylons -- you can't hit them over the head with this trait the way you can with "I'm a Dog". I think it also shifts the focus of the game from solving problems to hunting cylons. In Dogs, executing sinners is a tool in a Dog's toolbox, not the main purpose. The unifying trait should be about the recognized authority of the PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310535/#Comment_310535" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T23:35:42+00:00" title="February  1, 2011 11:35PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2011 11:36PM by Joli.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brenton</cite><br/>Someone LOSES PERSPECTIVE.<br/><br/>This leads to...<br/><br/>IRRESPONSIBLE ACTIONS.<br/><br/>These interruptions lead to fleet to being exposed to...<br/><br/>Cylon Attacks.<br/><br/>Eventually, these attacks, the worsening situation, and these bad beliefs lead to...<br/><br/>UNHEALTHY PHILOSOPHIES.<br/><br/>Left unchecked, individuals become RENEGADE LEADERS.<br/><br/>Eventually, these splinter groups gain enough power and contemplate...<br/><br/>CESSATION.</blockquote>\nI wish to subscribe to your newsletter.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310540/#Comment_310540" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T01:45:45+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  1:45AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wierd.

In the series military officers take the decisions. Only one civil authority seems to have power over them, which is the President herself and her council.

That said, "I'm the captain of this ship" trait also wouldn't usually work on people planning to blow it up. It's very situational. That said, I could see the "I'm not a Cylon" trait working on many people, because even if you know you also aren't a Cylon, you can NOT be sure that your family isn't... but you can be sure I'm not. So it's effective in a "you can trust me 100%". Plus even people who think they aren't Cylon aren't actually sure. There is often nagging doubt because you could be a sleeper agent.<br/><br/>But Dan also makes a good point that BSG is not about hunting Cylons. Cylons are the pressure to reveal what the human characters are made of. Many of the episodes deal with people as the problem, not Cylons. Just like the undead put pressure on people in Zombie movies. It's not really about the zombies. And in many great Dogs towns, it's not about the demons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310579/#Comment_310579" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T07:22:59+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  7:22AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quotes from BSG's series bible:<br/><br/><i>Our show is, first and foremost, a drama.

Knowing that someone isnt a cylon drains potential tension out of the game.  I think it's more interesting if it's possible the PC's are cylons and dont know it.  What a bit of fallout that would be!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want a "I'm a dog" statement make it "I'm a colonial warrior".  Still holds a lot of sway and power but people wont always give in just because you are part of the military.

Replace the actual characters from the show just use the situation, last great warship defending a rag tag fleet of civilians.  Every "town" is a different situation, a different crisis that you need to resolve.  I'd have to go over town creation in dogs but I'd try to make it similar.  The Cylons are attacking but this ship is down harvesting supplies.  The captain of the ship wants you to stay and defend his ship meanwhile the other captains of the fleet want you to jump.<br/>\n<br/>\nBattlestar is a little more difficult because of the rank structure involved in the military, then again that never seemed to bother half the characters when it came time to ignore an order or make there own decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brenton" title="Brenton"><img alt="Brenton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brenton">Brenton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310725/#Comment_310725" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T21:43:56+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  9:43PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we are going to look at the characters in the show and say, these few are the kinds of characters that are "Dogs" in the game, I'd have to say that these are my favorites:<br><br>Lee Adama<br>Starbuck -- Both of these characters are military officers who often get assigned to solve fleet problems.  But, at the same time, they have strong personal feelings about civil liberties and morality that lead them to decide that some things are not worth sacrificing for survival.<br><br>Billy -- He is not military, but he is the President's closest adviser and is given a lot of authority to adjudicate problems.  His feelings toward survival are much more liberal than either Lee's or Starbuck's, and he is a lot like the "redeemed sinner" kind of character in regular DitV.<br><br>Chief Tyrol (especially in some episodes of seasons 3 and 4) -- The Chief is a character that really empathizes with the plight of the non-military citizens of the fleet, and he has difficulty separating his personal emotions from his duties as an enlisted military personnel.  Everyone, civilian and military, feels they can rely on him, and that pulls on his conscience strongly.<br><br/><br/>The equivalent to a "I'm a Dog."-type trait, which I'll agree seems most important when the player burns it as Fallout and retires the character, is something that describes the troubleshooter role the character holds in the fleet.  For the characters above as examples, Lee ("I am the Commander of the Air Group" or "My father, the Commander, trusts me above anyone else."), Starbuck ("I'm the best damn soldier in the fleet."), Billy ("I'm the President's personal adviser."), and the Chief ("I'm the only crewman from a poor colony." or "I'm the Chief Deckhand.").  The Cylon-type traits, while interesting, change the focus of the game from problem solving to Cylon hunter.  While this is a perfectly valid game to play, I don't think it really captures the feel of (at least the first season of) BSG.<br/><br/>For towns, I think Vernon hits it right on the head with towns being problem situations.  The clearest example I can think of right now is season 1, episode 2 (or 3?), where Tom Zareg leads a prison break and demands a new government.  Here, a survival problem in the fleet is revealed to really be a dispute about the necessity of democracy, and Lee, especially, is challenged to choose between neat order and fair representation.  Another good example is the season 3 episode where the fuel ship laborers refuse to work until conditions are improved.  The Chief is sent in to force them to work, but he instead decides that oppression is not a price worth paying for survival, and joins the strike.<br/><br/>[Spoilers]<br/>The Chief also presents a cool example of the character's "I'm the deckhand everyone trusts." trait being burned.  At the end of Season 3, he finds that he is a Cylon.  Here, as Fallout, the Chief replaces his Troubleshooter trait with "I'm a Cylon 1d4."  Later "towns" deal with him trying to handle problems while hiding and struggling with this fact.  Eventually, he upgrades this trait to "I'm the liaison between the Cylons and the Fleet 1d6."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
