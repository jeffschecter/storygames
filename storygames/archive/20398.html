This first episode was about Ben Robbin's Microscope (Surprise!).<br/><br/>Our concept was about discovering magic in music in a early dark age England.<br/><br/>This session of Microscope was, to me, exceptional. I think the 4 of us wound up on the same page very early on and immediately and never left. I think this led the game to being very scene heavy early on (scene heavy in my experience.) In the final half of part 3, we conclude the session and speak about our thoughts on the game.<br/><br/>I personally love Microscope as a game and other than a few production issues, I was very happy with this actual play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
