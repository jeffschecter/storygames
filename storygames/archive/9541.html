What sort of preparation is rewarded in play, and what is a waste of time?  How can players push the game in the best ways?  What is tricky to get right?  What's confusing?  What should be assiduously avoided?<br/><br/>You've played The Mountain Witch a bunch, now please share your hard-earned wisdom!<br/><br/>Love,<br/><br/>O-Yanma<br/><b><br/>YOUR COLLECTIVE WISDOM THUSFAR</b>\n<ul>\n<li>GM:  When fishing, prompt multiple players to create a composite answer instead of having one player answer the question.</li>\n<li>Be flexible about how your Dark Fate enters the fiction.  Allow yourself to be surprised!</li>\n<li>Player Vs. Player conflict is to be expected and perhaps encouraged.  Be OK with this.</li>\n<li>GM:  Have some strong initial bangs prepared, and then modify later ones based on how the players react.</li>\n<li>Don't be coy about your Dark Fate.  Telegraph it early and introduce it when appropriate.</li>\n<li>Everybody needs to be aware of their responsibility for helping pace the game.</li>\n<li>GM:  Consider using the unused zodiac signs as prominent NPCs.</li>\n<li>GM:  Consider not using the duel rules for PVP duels to the death.  Instead:  The character of the player with the lower roll dies. Period. If there's a tie, then both characters die.</li>\n<li>GM:  Players splitting themselves up is better than you splitting them up.  But they should totally split up.</li>\n<li>Make sure the player characters are talking to each other.</li>\n<li>The mountain, the castle, the monsters and even O-Yanma are just a mirror. Present everything in such a way that it reflects back at the characters and their choices so far, and how they're being presented. If you can highlight differences, so much the better.</li>\n<li>At the outset, remind everyone that you are both creating and observing a drama, and there's no harm to mingle the two. This is mostly a heads up for the folks who are used to "thou shalt not mix the OOC and the IC" play.</li>\n<li>Use your power for evil. Don't just wait for the dark fates to bring the characters to conflict: point out opportunities for discord and strife.</li>\n<li>Tailor your mountain not just to the group, but to each character. If the group splits up, that's an great opportunity to present them with 2 completely different views of O Yanma, or two different routes up the mountain. If one group is fighting tooth and nail for every foot, and the other is halfway up the mountain wondering what the problem is, that's gold.</li>\n<li>Use the creepy supernatural stuff. Use it some more. Then use something completely normal. Blink innocently when they give you the fishy eye.</li>\n<li>Read everything Tim has to say below</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211672/#Comment_211672" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T12:56:08+00:00" title="June 11, 2009 12:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2009 1:00PM by timfire.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's this <a href="http://soulmuseum.googlepages.com/themountainwitch" rel="nofollow">page with a bunch of clarifications</a>, which was copied from my old website.

Yes, really. But a few things I've learned I think apply regardless of how long you take to get it done.<br/><br/>Since I often run this with strangers, I always state that by the end of the game, some of the characters are quite likely to be dead by another's hand. Everyone needs to be cool with the idea of PvP conflict and what it means for the game and the relationships between everyone at the table. <br/><br/>Make it clear that the players are responsible for bringing their Dark Fates into play and not to be too coy about it. In a 4-hour game, I really stress this, and every few minutes, ask straight out if anyone wants to foreshadow their DF in some way.<br/><br/>Have a nice list of bangs to drop on the characters at the beginning. Once you see which way they start to jump, modify the others on list to fit the characters' responses.<br/><br/>Uh, there's more but I can't think of them at the moment...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211806/#Comment_211806" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T20:18:42+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  8:18PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps the most important bit I can give is to be aware and take seriously your role in pacing the game. The other players can't perceive nor majorly influence whether this is going to be one of those 6-session campaigns or a quick one-session hike up the mountain. Find out which it is (either by considering your schedule or by looking at how the game is shaping up) and pace accordingly.<br/><br/>The Finnish edition of the game has some interesting stuff in the back index, I might as well throw out something for kicks...<br/><br/>One thing I've done in longer games is to take all the zodiac cards (I use cards for these) the players didn't pick and use them for important non-player characters. It's a sort of relationship map thing, as well as a pacing device and roleplaying guideline for myself: when I introduce such an important character, I'll also throw down one of those unused zodiacs to let the players know how important the character is. Furthermore, whenever the zodiac matches with a player character's, the NPC takes an immediate liking to that character, even in a dramatically unlikely situation. And of course when they are opposed, the NPC hates the PC's guts. Sometimes these first takes even have backstory reasons revealed by somebody, but otherwise they're just the sort of thing that happens in drama - people are not lukewarm and neutral towards each other, there are great hates and loves in there. The players can make use of this as well, and it's much easier to keep the cast distinct when you have an animal related to the guy you can draw on.<br/><br/>A bit random, but at least it's a tip nobody else is likely to give.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211844/#Comment_211844" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T04:41:27+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  4:41AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everybody.

As such, I'm going to take this as an opportunity to distinguish between how <i>*I*</i> run one-shots vs long games. Maybe its just my own personal bias, but I think there's a significant difference between the two (IMO as a player, not as the official designer). I think this deserves some discussion, because GMing the two types of games (IMO) kinda requires opposite strategies in some ways. There are three big difference that I see:<br/><br/><b>First is the way that Fates play out</b>. IME of one-shots, Fates tend to get revealed at the end of the game as part of the dramatic climax. In long games, however, Fates tend to get revealed maybe 1/2 or 2/3 of the way through. This makes Fates much more like Kickers, and requires that the GM shift gears in the second half (or whenever the Fates start coming out).<br/><br/>IME, the first half of a long game is much more about, umm, "sowing seeds". The GM just throws out lots of stuff and waits to see what the players grab on to (or create on their own). In the second half, the GM takes hold of whatever elements have "blossomed" and just starts twisting and tying until it's all just one big giant SNAFU. I tend to use fishing-type stuff in the first half, before I have an idea of the characters' Fates. In the second half, I mostly stop asking the players for input, and just start taking whatever the players have already given me and using it for my own purposes (while maintaining the thematic lines that the players already established, of course). If I'm going to start weaving stuff together, I usually wait for the second half.<br/><br/>IME, one-shots don't shift like that, and tend to focus more on fishing-type stuff.<br/><br/><b>Second is the timing of morally ambiguous or complicated situations</b>. In one-shots, things tend to work better if situations/conflicts start off morally ambiguous, and then simplify as time goes on. In long games, though, I usually start the game with simple situations/conflicts, and then build the moral complications as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The reason for this is that in short games, moral questions tend to get used as fodder for the development of characters' Fates and inter-party tension. In long games, moral complications become a way for the GM to exaggerate or extend pre-existing dramatic tensions.<br/><br/>This issue affects how the GM should prep. For one-shots, the GM really needs to come to the table with a number of strong and grabby bangs already in mind. Then, as the players start introducing Fate stuff, the GM backs off and just lets the players do their thing. For long games, however, I usually start with a number of generic and simple conflicts. Then, for subsequent sessions, after the players have started introducing Fate stuff and inter-party tension, I start tailoring the bangs to hit the emerging dramatic issues.<br/><br/><b>Third is the level of GM aggressiveness</b>. This issue is more than just pacing, though pacing is part of it. One-shots work better if the GM is more "proactive", while I like to run long games in more of a "reactive" mode. There are a couple things that play into this, though it's something that's hard for me to articulate, so bear with me.<br/><br/>IME, one-shots work better with an in-your-face GM who creates complicated situations and then tells the players, <i>"Choose, NOW!"</i> With one-shots, I try to go from bang to bang to bang, one right after another.<br/><br/>For long games, it depends a bit on whether we're talking first half or second half. In the first half, I just sorta present the players with interesting situations, wait to see how it plays out, and then ask the players what they thought about it. As such, "breather" scenes and quiet talk-y scenes become <i>very</i> important. You sorta get into a cycle of action -&gt; reflection, action -&gt; reflection. The cycle is still usually present in the later sections of the game, but the ratio of action to reflection goes up.<br/><br/>IME, in one-shots it usually helps if the GM, uh, "suggests" Fate-related stuff. Like <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=211703" rel="nofollow">Matt's "horseman" example</a> (which is pretty good, BTW), which basically "suggests" that there's some sort of connection between the characters. Furthermore, in one-shots I find it works better if every single scene has the <i>potential</i> for some sort of Fate-related or PvP tie-in. There's kinda the idea that the GM is presenting the players with holes for them to plug with their Fate stuff.<br/><br/>But in long games---in the first half, I mean---I take a much more "hands off" approach to characters' Fates. Rarely do I "try" to ever tie any of the early situations to the characters' Fates. If the players want that, they can do it themselves. The early scenes are much more about just defining the characters' personalities, relationships, and foreshadowing their Fates---and the players handle all of that. As GM, I view it as my job to just provide raw fodder, which may or may not end up getting used later on.<br/><br/>As such, there are a couple things I do in the first half. I usually focus on "soft" choices, that is, choices with minimal, if any, immediate consequence. Again, the idea here is to let the player define/express their character's personality &amp; such. Next, I focus a lot on more generic questions of morality and loyalty. It's mostly in the later half that I start directly addressing the characters Fates.<br/><br/>I should also say that I, as GM---especially in long games---tend to use weaving sparingly. It can be useful in one-shots when the GM needs to "suggest" Fate-related stuff, but in longer games, I find that players will usually take care of that on their own, if that's what they want for their character.<br/><br/><b>OK, one last thought</b>. A long game, much more than a one-shot, is all about emergent play. While the first half might have a generic, almost experimental feel to it, it's during the second half when things start to coalesce that the game really starts to pop. I suggest everyone keep an open mind in the beginning, and just build on things as they happen.<br/><br/>As such, if you follow the advice I give here and in the book, the pace of the game tends to escalate exponentially. That is say, the first two sessions will probably be pretty mellow, as the players define their characters. The game will start to pick up around the third session, when Fates start getting revealed. And then all hell will break loose in the fourth when everything finally comes to a head.<br/><br/>Could everyone follow me through all that?<br/><br/><i>(Also, give me a bit and I'll try responding to some of the stuff in this thread.)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211955/#Comment_211955" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T10:39:59+00:00" title="June 12, 2009 10:39AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff, Tim, keep it coming!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211982/#Comment_211982" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T12:14:47+00:00" title="June 12, 2009 12:14PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2009 3:19PM by timfire.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sean Musgrave</cite>An important factor when I've played is the flexibility that a player uses in developing their Dark Fate.<br/><br/>High flexibility = rewriting your dark fate in your head a bunch of times to adjust to cool new connections to other players and the situation = Awesome good time.</blockquote>\nIf you wanted, for a long game you could go so far as to tell the players that they don't need to decide on a Fate right away, that they can wait a couple Chapters to see how things pan out.

The witch doesn't get one, and there is a certain scarcity - while I haven't ever run out, it's clear that we can't waste the things on too minor characters. If there are many players, then the scarcity is of course even stronger. It also seems that only humans get them, not monsters or animals. The assignation is random, except if the character already has a relationship that determines something: if the character is supposed to be friendly towards a given character, for instance, then that might determine his zodiac if suitable ones are still available. Players can request a zodiac, but the GM is the one who decides who gets it and who doesn't. There is certain status in having a zodiac; it even seems like when I'm using this practice, I don't assign high strength to a NPC unless I also give him a zodiac.<br/><br/>So in total it seems that the technique is relatively unformed as of yet.

It's especially important for the characters to hint at their Dark Fates through their interactions with each other.  I think that's something that players are reluctant to do, especially in one shots.  My plan for next time is to firmly prompt players for this kind of thing if it doesn't come up naturally.  Something like "Nakamura and Mori are sitting up, keeping watch, and they get to talking.  What do they talk about?"<br/><br/>I've found players are always much more wary about giving hints than they should be - the secret always seems much more obvious when you know all the details.  Tim's comment that in one shots the Fates always come out right at the end is true to my experience, and I'm not sure the game is better for it.  It's probably good to reccommend that players be a little more obvious than they think they should.<br/><br/>This thread is making me want to play a long-form Mountain Witch game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Present everything in such a way that it reflects back at the characters and their choices so far, and how they're being presented.  If you can highlight differences, so much the better.  Example: In one game, I had a ronin who was all driven and "the world is an obstacle between us and heaven" and another ronin who was all easy-going "take the chances you're given".  When they reached the foot of the mountain, I said "There's two paths up from here; one is narrow and steep, but more direct.  The other path is easier, but will take longer."<br/><br/>At the outset, remind everyone that you are both creating and observing a drama, and there's no harm to mingle the two.  This is mostly a heads up for the folks who are used to "thou shalt not mix the OOC and the IC" play.<br/><br/>Use your power for evil.  Don't just wait for the dark fates to bring the characters to conflict: point out opportunities for discord and strife.  If one ronin is doing well in fights, then start the next fight by saying "A whatevermahosit jumps out of the woods.  The Ox is probably just going to cut it down like the last three things, but the rest of you are welcome to take a shot, if you care."<br/><br/>Related to the mirror bit above: tailor your mountain not just to the group, but to each character.  If the group splits up, that's an great opportunity to present them with 2 completely different views of O Yanma, or two different routes up the mountain.  If one group is fighting tooth and nail for every foot, and the other is halfway up the mountain wondering what the problem is, that's gold.<br/><br/>Use the creepy supernatural stuff.  Use it some more.  Then use something completely normal.  Blink innocently when they give you the fishy eye.<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212649/#Comment_212649" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T11:29:07+00:00" title="June 16, 2009 11:29AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff, James!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212682/#Comment_212682" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T13:03:04+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  1:03PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2009 1:09PM by timfire.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, it's almost too obvious to say, but: "<i>Read the book.</i>" I know there's not a whole lot in the "Playing the Game" chapter---which is the big reason I want to edit the book---but I discuss the basic strategy and a few good techniques. I'll add a few things here:<br/><br/>First, the book assumes that most of the adventure will take place in the fortress. That's fine, though <i>*personally*</i> I've taken to splitting it 50/50. Maybe the first half of the game is spent on the journey up the mountain (Acts I &amp; II, if you're following that), and the second half inside the fortress (Acts III &amp; IV). I've also taken to spending a good bit of time in the (haunted) forest before moving on the formal ascent. It's just a little easier to come up with spooky and weird shit when you're working with a forest, rather than a barren mountain side. But that's all just personal preference.<br/><br/>Speaking of the "Four Acts"---you can use them if you want, but nowadays I usually just divide the game into 2 phases: a) before Fates are revealed and b) after. Basically the "first half" and "second half" I've been discussing.<br/><br/>The GM shouldn't be afraid to be tough on the players, mechanically-speaking. Given that the players have Trust to spend, Aiding will always overcome. In longer games, I really like to wear down the group's Trust point levels before breaking for a new Chapter. (If I always did that in one-shots, I would probably end up with only, like, 2 chapters.) You can be a bit easier in the early parts of the game, if you want, but I try to be pretty tough in the later sections. Sometimes, I'll even push a Conflict or two beyond the point where the characters have run out of Trust to spend, if I want them to feel a little pain.<br/><br/>For a "medium" difficulty Conflict, I usually present one weak enemy for every character involved. Such a fight will probably require 3-4 rounds of rolling, depending on whether the players are Aiding and how they group themselves. Such a Conflict <i>*should*</i> also still be winnable if the players aren't using Trust, though it'll be a bit tough.<br/><br/>Since this will be Joe's first time GMing the game, I would advise that he start off with a couple Conflicts that are slightly easier (# of characters - 1 or 2), to give him a baseline feel for difficulty. Then he can start playing around with the numbers and enemy Strengths. He'll probably need to experiment a bit to get a feel for what makes an "easy" or "hard" Conflict.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>The mountain, the castle, the monsters and even O-Yanma are just a mirror.

When they reached the foot of the mountain, I said "There's two paths up from here; one is narrow and steep, but more direct. The other path is easier, but will take longer."</blockquote>\nYep, that's good advice.  It also reminds me of something else I do---I'll commonly throw in a couple characters that spout pseudo-Buddhist spiritual rhetoric. You know, like "life is suffering", "reality is an illusion", "there is no good and evil, only balance and imbalance", karma and reincarnation, "there is nothing but the moment", etc. You probably have to actually know a bit about Buddhist/Taoist/Shinto/Zen thought to make it work, though. Sometimes I'll be more "honest", and just talk Zen-ish talk. But often, I'll twist it and imply that the Witch isn't so bad, or that the mission is meaningless, etc.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, I realize this is an example of the "sowing seeds" idea I mentioned earlier. Like, in my Nerdly game, I presented the characters with an old man selling food at a stand on the side the forest path. He was harmless, he really was just an old man... well, maybe he was a spirit, I never decided... Anyway, the ronin started talking to him, and he said that he used to have a lonely, hard life (like the ronin), but then he realized that there was no good or evil, honor or duty---there was only one man trying to control another. With that "enlightenment", he moved to the mountain side, where he now lived in peace. <br/><br/>When I do something like that, I wait to see what kind of reaction I get. If it seems to peak the players' interest, then I'll later introduce a different character (or maybe the same one) that starts spouting similar talk, but refining the speech/action according to the thematic line(s) that seem to interest the player(s). But if I get a lukewarm reaction from the players, I just forget the pseudo-spiritual talk and leave it as color. In my Nerdly game, I got a mild reaction to the old man, so I left the spiritual talk alone. However, one of the players did pick up on the "honor" theme, so I added some comments about honor and duty when that player's character had a dream sequence about his father.
