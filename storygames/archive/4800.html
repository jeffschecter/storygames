Quick and lean -- dare I say Risus-like in some ways, but using descriptors in a way not entirely unlike Aspects in Spirit of the Century/Fate 3.0.    If I had to boil it down to someone, I'd say "a quick dice randomizer with Fate's Aspects wrapped around it to tweak the numbers", and I would consider that both an accurate and positive review.<br/><br/>Sidenote: A friend of mine played in one of the two games that you used this system for at AmberCon, and had a lot of good stuff to say about it.<br/><br/>It's interesting, because it ties into something that I'd been pondering with regards to mechanics over the last couple weeks.  That 'thing' is this:  \n<blockquote>There are really two things that an "edge" in a game can do (by "edge" I just mean "that thing on the character sheet that lets you tweak things in your favor" -- Aspects, Edges, Traits, Supporting Characteristics, etc., etc.).<br/><br/>1. They can be used to give you a intial, pre-roll boost to your chances of success, increasing your odds of being awesome.  Primetime Adventures does this.  Spirit of the Century pretty much does this.  I think your system does this.  <br/><br/>2. They can be used to stave off or lessen the sting of failure.  Galactic's "Edges" do this.  I think that any traits you narrate in after a conflict has started in Dogs in the Vineyard do this.  "Doom" in Conspiracy of Shadows does this.  I know there are others.</blockquote>\nNow, my point is this: numerically, your end result using these 'edges' in either of the two ways above might be exactly the same, but they *feel* different, and that feeling probably seeps into the tone of the game, pushing either toward adventure-heroic or the survivalist-gritty.<br/><br/><b>I'm not talking power level here.</b> It doesn't matter if you're giving folks one 'edge', or five, or ten -- I think if they're implemented in the style of Mode 1, above, it's going to have a kind of "let's be awesome" feel, and if you're using them in Mode 2, it's going to have a kind of "let's survive this" feel.<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm saying is that the game system itself is sort of built toward a "let's be awesome" <i>tone</i>.<br/><br/>My friend mentioned, while talking about the action-adventure game you ran, and explaining the system to me, that you'd used the same system for a gritty 'world war two tank story', and my first thought was "I wonder if the system will be subtly fighting that tone."<br/><br/>He said "but I think they're using it at a lower power level", and I replied that I didn't think it would matter, for the reasons mentioned above.<br/><br/>I noticed that you've posted about that 'tank' game in another thread, and mentioned that it was a little more Kelly's Heroes than Johann's Panzer, and I wonder if maybe ... at least in <i>part</i>, if that wasn't because  the system was whispering "let's be awesome" instead of "let's survive this."<br/><br/>Maybe, for a gritty game with the same system, the thing to tweak to help you with tone isn't the number of 'edges' -- what you call Supporting Characteristics, but <i>the way in which they can be invoked in the game</i>.  In other words, for 'gritty' -- you can only invoke them after the roll, if the roll wasn't in your favor.<br/><br/>Or something; just random brainstorming on my part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108251/#Comment_108251" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T10:32:00+00:00" title="November 14, 2007 10:32AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I quite liked that the system would fit on the back of a postcard.

At the moment, 6 is always a negative consequence and 1 is always a positive; the negative number gradually counts down the longer the conflict goes on, so it becomes more and more likely that you'll get a negative consequence, even on a success.<br/><br/>That's not much direct use for you but it may possibly spark an idea in some lateral way. (Basically, I looked for something that wasn't going to directly depend on whether you got a success or not, but was strongly correlated.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108350/#Comment_108350" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T22:30:59+00:00" title="November 14, 2007 10:30PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really interesting, Mike.

In the Professionals game at ACNW we had "Takes a Licking and Keeps On Ticking", "Calm, Cool, Collected" and "Unshakeable" which came into play mainly after the characters had taken hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could make it grittier by allowing SCs like "Takes a Licking--" to enable characters to act as another Effect Trait box. For a while, until they can get fixed up or a temporary ET wears off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Professionals game the Reroll awards were aimed squarely at the action movie genre. We got them for cool action bits and character bits -- interesting shots or scenes in our movie. Award them for furthering the grit -- or whatever feel or genre you're shooting for -- and it should help things along.<br/>\n<br/>\nPower level/ SC number may not help per se but it more SCs does allow you to use them for gritty, tough bastard characteristics.<br/>\n<br/>\nTone is also set by level of opposition. If you're scrambling to win your conflicts and watching your ET boxes fill up, that sets it on Gritty/Survival to my mind . <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might add in more of the tappable SotC scene Aspect thang to give the game more of a tactical feel. Mods to Effect die rolls against you for taking cover, mods for smoke, fire, polka music, whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
