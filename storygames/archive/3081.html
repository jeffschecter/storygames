I am contacting several friends who are within a few states of me asking if I can run a playtest session for them. I have been compelled to write up a "what the hell are you asking me to play?" statement, so I figured I'd share it here:<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Misspent Youth is a roleplaying game set in the near future. The players collaboratively create a world and an antagonist, called The Authority, which seeks to destroy what your characters value. Features:<br/><br/>* Two kinds of traits: selection from archetype and open creation<br/>* Conflict resolution in a craps game, rigged for thematic appropriateness, where you risk your youthful purity to be victorious<br/>* Narrative control economy which encourages the introduction of thematic elements<br/>* Rule bias toward player cooperation, but with short term advantage for betrayal<br/>* Spotlight character rules<br/><br/>How far are you willing to compromise your ideals for the greater good or your personal glory? Find out.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>After I run this series of playtests, I'm going to see if I can get some real writing done (assuming major rules surgery isn't needed and my classes this summer are as un-hectic as I think they will be). I may be able to ashcan soon, maybe by DexCon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
