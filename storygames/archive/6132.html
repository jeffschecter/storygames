I've had Dogs in the Vineyard games where the NPCs were tools to be used and discarded, to be rolled over in order to get to the Demon.  I've had compelling NPCs in D&amp;D 3e and L5R that have been central to the players' actions in the story. It all depends on the focus, setup, and that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Some games, and by "some" I mean specifically Inuma and In a Wicked Age among others, have a setup where all the characters are just laid out. They're charcaters. Then the players come along and pick which ones they want to play *this time*. Those characters, protags or antags, become "special" (and are owned, like PCs). The rest become NPCs. When the story is over, the PCs get returned to the pile and become "characters" again. So while they are treated differently than other RPGs, they are truly not "special", any more than any other character (well, they become Owned, so that is special I guess. I think I mean at the Beginning of the session, they are not "special"). But in games where NPCs can become PCs, they become something more than objects to trample over.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136643/#Comment_136643" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T08:50:43+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  8:50AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you want them to be?

So I can have a game with no props, but a game with no characters (save those played by the PCs) tends to be rather dull. <br/><br/>The things most folks call "NPCs" may be characters or they may be props. All depends on what I'm doing.

Are there different rules for living people generally than for example items?<br/><br/>I mean in DnD an NPC can have the same traits as a PC. Wich I think is a problem, because an NPC should be easier to use, not as complex as a PC.<br/>But if I read The Lord of the Rings, than the even trees and mountains can have an own will or inversely, fighting a human being is not different than fighting a droid or fighting a meteor shower. In terms of traditional RPGs: if a meteor shower can be represented by a simple difficulty number without combat statistics, etc., than an enemy soldier can be represented too by a single difficulty number.<br/><br/>I mean an NPC (wich is not to be controlled like 'my character' at any time, but is controlled as an 'extra' or a problem for the players) is just a prop, just like a mountain in the setting.

The most radical examples are PrimeTime Adventures and Trollbabe. In both of these, NPCs have no traits or even character sheets. They are defined only by their name, their relationships to the player characters, and what they do in actual play. This is my favorite approach because it eliminates a lot of GM prep.<br/><br/>In many other games, an NPC is only as detailed as his or her part in the story demands. So for example in Spirit of the Century, there are major opponents who are defined just like player characters, but there are also companions and minions who have only one or two traits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136726/#Comment_136726" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T17:41:36+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  5:41PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite>I mean an NPC (wich is not to be controlled like 'my character' at any time, but is controlled as an 'extra' or a problem for the players) is just a prop, just like a mountain in the setting.

NPCs are active agents, so that justifies having special rules for them.  But it varies by game.  HeroQuest NPCs and props are treated the same (althougha GM can choose to make NPCs as complex as PCs there's absolutely no reason to or instruction to do that).  In In A Wicked Age, there's no rules for props at all, and NPCs have simplified stats. HQ is close to what you describe, as it aims for something very mythic.  Trees and meteors<br/><br/>I'd venture to say in most (at least many) story games treat NPCs with similar rules as PCs, but simplified. They're not as complex, but they operate under similar systems. But the mechanics in general are usually simplified. In A Wicked Age a player has 7 stats total, NPCs have 3. And one set of conflict rules that uses them in different ways.  In HeroQuest, PCs can have dozens of stats, each describing a different ability or personality trait or relationship or magical spell, but they boil down into a single number you use to roll.  NPCs, props, whatever it is you are struggling against has a number that you roll against and its the exact same system whether it's combat, a legal debate, or a cooking contest.<br/><br/>So, if you have been unhappy with games that treat NPCs just like PCs, then I think you will be pleased by the variety of options that is found in story games. But it's hard to generalize since most of them avoid being general.  Is there something specific you are looking for or displeased about as far as how NPCs have been treated in games you've played?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136733/#Comment_136733" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T19:24:20+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  7:24PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where's the character/furniture thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown" title="Vasco Brown"><img alt="Vasco Brown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/720dbb7653b3d0bf450544cf2959a255.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown">Vasco Brown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136738/#Comment_136738" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T21:58:51+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  9:58PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>They are more important than props, since they can be used to drive conflict and props rarely can. <b>And Brand is right, games with only PCs tend to be dull</b>.
