I knew Joe and Calum from playing with them at Nerdinburgh \u201908, and had played The Shab-Al-Hiri Roach with Debbie, Joe, and Calum the previous night. I had never played with Stuart before, but had met him briefly at Nerdinburgh, and was happy to have him along. Rather than playing in this game I sat to the side, facilitated, and nudged when necessary.<br/><br/>We sat down at the table, and I handed out the character sheets. The Dystopia Sheet is placed at the centre of the table. I briefly reviewed that everyone was relatively comfortable with the definition of dystopia provided by the game, and I started to read off the list of dystopia \u201cTypes\u201d so we could establish our setting. After quite a bit of discussion I interjected, and asked if they would rather randomly determine the setting. We rolled a one for the primary Type, which was good old Totalitarian Dystopia. The group decided that was a little vanilla, and so we rolled for a secondary Type and got a four, which indicates an Alien Dystopia. So we wrote, on the Dystopia Sheet \u201cTotalitarian / Alien.\u201d This stimulated a massive chat about possible settings, which eventually resulted in a Human Theme Park on an alien planet. The park is a bad vision of earth in the year 2008, with constant humorous and sometimes unsettling historical inaccuracies. The aliens are in actuality only around 3 inches tall, and they fly through pneumatic tubes to go through the park and observe the specimens. Despite their size, the aliens are capable of killing a human with only a thought.<br/><br/>We launched into character creation, and while there were areas of difficulty it ended with some very interesting characters. Calum ended up playing an enforcer of the alien overlord\u2019s dictates \u2013 a human oppressing humans. Debbie created a woman bred to play the part of Princess Diana, First Woman On The Moon. Joe ended up a lowly fry cook, just going through the paces. Stuart was playing one of the Aliens, a Manager of the park and a pretty ruthless, sadistic bastard. Some choices in chargen I found really interesting included the Emphasis choices. Emphasis determines whether the story will concentrate more on your character\u2019s struggle with the dystopia itself (Spotlight Emphasis) or an internal struggle somehow mirrored and thrown into relief by the dystopia (Backdrop Emphasis). Only one character ended up choosing Backdrop, and that was Calum. It was made more interesting when he won the Hope \u201cA Person Who Comforts Me and Makes Me Confident\u201d \u2013 which was in direct contrast to the way he had acted thus far, merely an ultraviolent thug with no family or friends. (I have great thoughts for what his next scene, which is known as The Turning Point, would have been.)<br/><br/>This is already pretty long, so I won\u2019t give a blow-by-blow as I often can. Suffice to say that everyone brought excellent ideas and play to the table. I loved many moments in the narrative \u2013 adored the opening scenes from each player in particular, which were establishing shots that give us a feeling for the character\u2019s lives. The system revealed flaws, as you might expect from a first-time design and first-time playtest, but also strengths \u2013 the system seemed to push things towards dystopia even better than I had hoped. The new addition to the system incorporating real-life player Hopes worked well, I thought. Likewise the dice system worked at least as well as I had hoped.<br/><br/>I\u2019m really looking forward to working further on this game. I\u2019m possibly more excited than I\u2019ve ever been about writing it.<br/><br/>It kinda <i>worked</i>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wow</span>.<br/><br/>I can\u2019t thank Joe, Calum, Stuart, and Debbie enough. You guys kick ass, you rocked my game and gave me more assistance and food for thought than you can conceive of.<br/><br/>Thank you, thank you, <i>thank you</i>. I hope I can return the favour one day.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136242/#Comment_136242" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T05:35:08+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  5:35AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here were the cool bits:<br/><br/>The alien middle manager describing how he was a little stressed, with a heartrate of 850. Stressed because his rival had developed an improved breeding program, with humans popping out after three months instead of a tardy nine! But how?! The players realised all that was going on was a bunch of premature births, and that the proto-humans weren't going to be working any shifts soon. But as a piece of misguided alien politicking... ick.<br/><br/>Diana, First Woman On The Moon describing how she was one of a long line of quality reproducers. And that she wore an electro-collar that paraylsed her when she tried to resist breeding. In a later scene, she was subdued and brought to the breeding hall, which of course was a reproduction of Saturday Night Fever. Ick.<br/><br/>My severely brain-damaged, illiterate, fry cook (with a Hope of <i>Freedom of Movement</i>)returning to his 6 x 6 x 6 bubble apartment. Punching a wall and looking through to see an adjoining apartment. Reaching through and carefully strangling the girl next door. He now had a 12 x 6 x 6. But how to get rid of the body? Well, he worked in the kitchen...<br/><br/>The thug returning to his team's quarters after successfully putting down a protest at the pool. I explained how a fax came through:<br/><br/>* Good news! There's double rations tonight!<br/>* Bad news! The team needs to be cut down by 50%. Right now.<br/>* So in a sense... there's the same amount of food as usual.

Capable of turning on it's head in a moment from surreal humour to being truly dark. But we've had input on the story so far, so a few thoughts from me on the system itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopes vs Ideals threw us off a little. Like all description-based parts of a character sheet it can be a bit tough to catch on to what fits. Really all that would help here might be a couple more examples, and a clearer understanding by the players of what the point of them is.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaining new hopes randomly. Awesome. Throws a real twist, makes even the player wonder who their character really is. The only danger here is that since it's drawn from what the players care about we all sat there and tried to come up with things that aren't simply family or partner. I know this had me stumped and I wasn't particularly happy with what I did come up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the other players jump in as NPCs is good, though maybe I shouldn't have come in so quick to be a voodoo doll, I think I just wanted to test it out and see how it worked. <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting the player opposite you kind of "gming" for your character was good, though I didn't feel their opposition (or whatever it was called) came into it much, though that could just be because we only did a couple of scenes each.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Calum                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
