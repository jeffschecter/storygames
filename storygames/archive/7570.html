We finally sat down to get started last night with a couple of hours going through the game creation process, character creation and experience scenes. <br/><br/>Spending a short session doing this is always beneficial for a game of Hot War: it allows people to get to grips with setting elements, lay down the groundwork for the game and ease themselves in to the way the game plays.<br/><br/>The group is made of me (GMing), Doug, Lucy and Stu. We've all played in various games together before, mostly single session games. So it's nice to have the chance to all participate in a slightly longer game, perhaps two or three weeks of play sessions (not including this initial session). It was a pretty relaxed session, round the kitchen table, with a selection of cold meats and crusty bread to snack on! I always find that decent food really does enhance a game.<br/><br/>All my preparatory stuff aside, the meat of the first half hour was in the game creation which everyone chipped their thoughts and ideas in to. Handy tip: the Player's Primer from the back of the book only takes a couple of minutes to read through and really does help people get to grips with stuff.<br/><br/>Here's what we created (most of this will just summarise the notes I took during this part of play):<br/><br/>Closed or Open Game: Doug was keen for the game to be closed (in that the hidden agendas and secrets of the character are kept hidden from the other players until they are revealed in play). It's been ages since I've run a closed game, so it'll be very interesting to see how this develops.<br/><br/>Tone: Not full-on survival horror, there is structure to society, elements of horror, gritty, washed out colours like 'Children of Men', political elements.<br/><br/>What are the characters doing?: Nothing gung-ho or gun-toting, political stuff, mundane job to do as well: guarding barges of refugees getting taken down the Thames to the internment camps. They have been approached by some faction to do something with the refugees. No tedious bureaucratic stuff!<br/><br/>Who are the antagonists?: 'Someone' outside of London who is gradually trying to disrupt the Government and military by various means (espionage, sabotage etc.). Pro-refugee 'terrorists' or 'freedom fighters'. A defector to 'our side', but are they really on our side? Group within the refugees who extort from and brutalise their own kind, like a prison gang.<br/><br/>Who else is involved?:]Martin Darby MP, a politician. A loud, brash American refugee who is being sent to the camps for a lack of proper papers. A military police 'Redcap', Corporal Phillip 'Big Phil' Carter. Black marketeering gangsters.<br/><br/>What scenes would you like to see (described in the form of a single, black &amp; white photograph):<br/><br/>Doug: A fuel silo, 2 people appear to be having an intense, heated conversation. There is another person slinking around in the background. They are clutching a knife.<br/><br/>Stu: A crowd of people pressing against an electric fence. They are clutching bundles of belongings and it looks like things are verging on a riot. fear and terror are written on their faces. Something off-camera is terrifying them.<br/><br/>Lucy: Trafalgar Square at midday. It is busy, lots of people around. The photo is focussed on someone standing under one of the lions. They do not fit in, they are waiting for someone.<br/><br/>And that was the game set-up. It produced some elements really ripe for conflict and engaging story and everyone got to put in stuff that they wanted to see. Then it's on to the characters!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167944/#Comment_167944" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T09:00:41+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  9:00AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2008 9:04AM by Malcolm Craig.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The characters that were created were:<br/>\n<br/>\nBen Slater (Stu): A 'broken hero' and former fireman. A trustworthy, honest man, he seems perhaps a little too affected by all that he saw during the war.<br/>\n<br/>\nExperience scene: During the first days of the war, Slater is in the fire-engulfed <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ormond_Street" rel="nofollow">Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital</a>, desperately trying to fight the blaze. He has heard the cries of children and rushes towards a locked room, battering the door in. The cries are actually coming from a horrible bio-mechanical creature with some strange voicebox attached to its chest. It has recorded the cries of dying children and is playing them back. Two kids are still alive. In the conflict, Stu wins and gets to narrate how he gets the kids out, but maybe the creature is still around...?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis scene establishes the fact that during the war, the innocent were most certainly not spared.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Sanderson (Doug): A troubled RAF officer who is cool in a crisis, but troubled by things in his past.<br/>\n<br/>\nExperience scene: Sanderson is flying a Vulcan above England. The bomb bay doors are jammed and his friend is down in the guts of the aircraft trying to get them open. He gets an order to run an emergency jettison procedure so the failing aircraft and its bomb load won't hit an intact village. Doug won the dice rolling, the bombs missing the village but his friend falls through the sky. As an interesting note, the music that was playing in the background at this point was redolent of soaring flight. It was commented on that it gave the impression of the Vulcan soaring through blue skies, with green fields beneath, a stark contrast to the grime and dirt of the other two experience scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis scene establishes the fact that there are still some areas of England that were unaffected by the war.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine Stevens (Lucy): A former political journalist who had her faith in the system severely tested by the events of the past year.<br/>\n<br/>\nExperience scene: Stevens is in a heated confrontation with the aide of a prominent Cabinet Minister. The Minister is being hurried away from Westminster in an Army truck that is being loaded with valuable and foodstuffs. Soldiers who could be better used elsewhere are assisting the politicians. In the background, a column of badly wounded soldiers, who have greater need of the truck, trudge past in the pouring. The aide tries to get it through to Stevens that nobody cares any more, there are no more news outlets, nobody is listening. The conflict goes badly, Lucy loses the dice roll and Stevens is pushed into a deep puddle and her hefty, reel-to-reel tape recorder destroyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis scene establishes the fact that the free press has been completely suppressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's an interesting thing about the scenes in that they all involved different elements in a prominent way: The one with Slater had fire, the one with Sanderson had air and the one with Stevens had water. And all the characters surnames begin with S. Huh, I never even thought about that last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, this was a very worthwhile session that laid the foundation for what looks to be a very interesting game. And all in under two hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore to come next week as the game proper gets going.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167952/#Comment_167952" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T09:17:38+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  9:17AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope you all capitalize on the elemental connections moving forward.

It was kind of strange: none of us picked up on it during or after the experience scenes, but it was really very obvious (rain and puddles in one, a burning hospital in the next and flying through blue skies in the last). It's something I'll certainly raise before we get in to the first session of play and see if we can draw it further in to the game.<br><br>Cheers<br>Malcolm                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
