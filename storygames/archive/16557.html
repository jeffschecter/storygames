(Thanks again to those of you who playtested the first draft.) Here's the elevator pitch:</p>\n<p>Heroine is a game for 3+ in which you tell the story of a courageous girl is far from home. The game is inspired by Labyrinth, the Wizard of Oz, and Alice in Wonderland. In Heroine, one player plays the young girl who is magically transported to the Other Land. The other players take turns playing the Narrator and one of the Heroine's quirky new Companions.</p>\n<p>The game requires no prep by the Narrator, and can be played in roughly one or two sessions.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you are interested in playtesting. I am willing to play over Skype, but I am most interested in how the game goes when you run it.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshJordan" title="JoshJordan"><img alt="JoshJordan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6AKy_z4Epr0/TIfoTVksbnI/AAAAAAAAABg/OlTRzNj-YcA/s320/Icon.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshJordan">JoshJordan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380385/#Comment_380385" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T18:27:56+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  6:27PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Arpie,</p>\n<p>Please whisper me your group's names as you want to be credited in the book as playtesters.</p>\n<p>Thanks again.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380403/#Comment_380403" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T02:14:34+00:00" title="June  1, 2012  2:14AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2012 7:45PM by Arpie.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've already whispered my results to Josh, but here's the outcome of the playtest, for those who are interested:<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I had expected three players, only Antonio and I showed up to the game session (and Antonio mostly helped out because he felt sorry for me.)<br/>\nWe still managed to play a quick game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story that evolved:<br/>\nWe choose to center our story around a heroine named Jenni with an "I."<br/>\nShe is a 16-year-old spoiled brat who is denied her chance at being homecoming queen when her athletic date does not show up for the dance.<br/>\n-- Note: I was drawn to this game because I was looking for a whimsical, GMless experience, perhaps one I could play with my neice when she gets old enough. The game has a list of basic character types, but Antonio suggest that perhaps each character type should have a corresponding suggestion for a good problem and allegorical otherworld she needs to visit (certain of the character types are challenging and unpleasant, but most of them are familiar to lovers of this kind of literature.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe homecoming crown is instead awarded to Jenni's runner up (and gloating rival - whose name I did not write down.) Mr. Lumpley sides with the homecoming committee in denying Jenni her coveted crown.<br/>\nIn a rage, she kicks a clock and time stops for everyone but her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the frozen world outside of time, Jenni's first temptation is to mess with her homecoming date (who it turns out was in a car accident enroute.) <br/>\n-- failed initial challenge (she Took a Chance)<br/>\nShe plants evidence in his cell phone while he's frozen in time that makes him guilty of ditching her.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe then meets Billie Winkie (my character), an ugly bird-like creature that claims to be the son of the Sandman.<br/>\nBillie warns Jenni that she's a target for the Sandman, who will pour sand in her eyes until she rubs them out (and then feed said eyes to Willie, who secretly loathes the taste of eyeballs, but is too afraid to tell his scary dad.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBillie offers a simple choice: all she has to do is restart the hands of the clock and Jenni can return to normal time, none the wiser.<br/>\n(Billie is in trouble for telling her about the danger she's in, even talking to a human with such tasty eyeballs, but rolls well, giving Jenni a 5.)<br/>\n-- Note: Up until this point, we've only had one problem with the game as written and that is that it's a three player game and we only have two players.<br/>\nThe game has a specific role for the heroine outlined, but we made due by passing the heroine duties back and forth, thus idealizing the character and making it more of a shared experience. We passed these suggestions along to Josh (along with a .pdf we hope he got.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--Note: We hit the only real big problem in the playtest at this point when we were unsure how to resolve the role of the Companion-class characters. We made a guess that seemed to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Jenni ignores Billie and goes on a rampage of revenge, planting naughty photos in Mr. Lumpley's desk, torturing her rivals and playing other cruel practical jokes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately, Jenni cleverly ties some gauze around her eyes so that Billie can claim (to his approaching father) that he's gobbled them up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Jenni again has the chance to return to normal time, she feels sorry for Billie and decides to teach him the vegetarian option, taking him to the Vegan Restaurant her completely-the-opposite-of-her parents own and showing him alternatives to eyeballs.<br/>\n(He ends up liking tomatoes in peanut butter and mayonaise.)<br/>\nAt the restaurant, Jenni meets a mysterious (but darkly gorgeous) young man (secretly a mythical figure in disguise, but who is not revealed until later) who begs her to return to real time before she gets "stuck."<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, the attractive older boy gets stuck when he tries to return to real time and Jenni wades through the chaos she has unleashed to haul him back to the Moments Between, where the boy becomes unstuck again.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Note:  The game has pretty clear mechanics for what is happening and goes into detail on the story formula needed to create an allegorical growing-up fable. It does get a little academic in spots and we suggested perhaps obfuscating some of the theory with specifically-worded questions (which Josh had already mostly provided in his list of example scenes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also noted at this point that the mechanics could even be simplified further by changing the idea from individual moves (as Josh has it presented) to a question with resource-spending options following it. Although the rules work as-is, I feel there's always room for simplification, especially in a youth-oriented genre piece such as this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong story short, the boy turns out to be Father Time in disguise, who is trying to thwart a scheme by the Sandman. <br/>\nThe Gorgeous Boy (Father Time) finally reveals that he can set everything back the way it was if Jenni will confront the Sandman for him (something he's forbidden to do himself) - her only other alternative is returning to real time and becoming a scapegoat for the Sandman's much more malicious mischief (and eyeball harvesting.)<br/>\nConflicted, Billie goes to distract his father and ends up getting tortured until he reveals Father Time's plans. Father Time breaks the rules and suffers a terrible penalty for confronting Sandman, but Jenni steps in to heroically save the day.<br/>\nShe confronts the Sandman but turns down Father Time's offer to put everything back the way it was. She returns to the real world to face the consequences of her pranks, apologize and make ammends finding, to her suprise, that every task she undertakes to make things right seems to go much more quickly than normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also leaves salads regularly for the weird little bird statue (that resembles Billie) that she finds in strange places.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, Josh, even though you say the game is for 3 players, it is possible to run it and create a story with two players, although some considerable tweaking was required.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly encourage you to bring this game out as soon as possible. It's a genre I like and it seems like a winner.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe'd love to hear what questions you may have for us, Josh. We've certainly got more and more annoying answers where these came from!<br/>\n<br/>\n(Also, if this had not been played in a game store, I would have used Danny Elfman's twisted "Little Girls" for the soundtrack. Pillowfight in Dr. Caligari's LA!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshJordan" title="JoshJordan"><img alt="JoshJordan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6AKy_z4Epr0/TIfoTVksbnI/AAAAAAAAABg/OlTRzNj-YcA/s320/Icon.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshJordan">JoshJordan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380498/#Comment_380498" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T18:35:13+00:00" title="June  1, 2012  6:35PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2012 6:36PM by JoshJordan.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Awesome.
