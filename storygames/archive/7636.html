I worked out a deal with the RPG coordinator, Liz and we'll be all under one banner with two dedicated tables.<br/><br/>My goal is that not only do we get dedicated tables but we work together to play in one another's games and play the things we want to!!!  And we start a bit of a "brand recognition" vibe going where people begin to differentiate between the IGE players, GMs and games and the rest of the events.  Quality people.  Quality games.  <br/><br/>This makes me happy.  So I have Luke, John (Jenskot), Kat, Mr. Miller, Joanna and myself.<br/><br/>We have a limited number of tables but I could probably take one or two more GMs.  And if your coming to UberCon and want to take advantage of this then let me know and I can put your names in early.  I guarentee there will be a host of great games.<br/><br/>Good gaming,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169792/#Comment_169792" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T04:30:55+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  4:30AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thus far Joanna is running these two games:<br/><br/>Title: \u201cThe Dust of the Ground\u201d<br/>System: Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>Players:  2 \u2013 4<br/>Description: Veiled rumors have reached the ears of the Elders; that something is wrong in Iron Town.  Armed with your six-gun, Book of Life and coat of office, you and fellow Watchdogs of God have been dispatched to uncover the truth and bring the town, its people and its mine back into the light of the King of Heaven.  <br/><br/>Title: \u201cThe Mountain Witch versus the League of Heroes\u201d<br/>System: The Mountain Witch<br/>Players: 3 - 6<br/>Description: Deep within his mountain hideout, the Mountain Witch has long led his evil minions in a reign of terror on Capitol City.  The good people of Capitol City are in need of help and a handful of members of the League of Heroes have answered the call.  The Dark Fates of the heroes drive their choices; trust, betrayal, honor and death are all on the line in this story of good versus evil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170821/#Comment_170821" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T19:53:56+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  7:53PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The games I am running:<br/><br/>Title: \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d<br/>System: Don't Rest Your Head<br/>Players: 2 \u2013 4<br/>Description: Enter the Mad City.  You are awakened to the city's horrors through pain and madness when you find yourself unable to sleep.  You discover the city's Nightmares feed off the fears of its denizens.  Be wary you don't fall asleep lest they turn their attentions on you.  In this scenario you play inmates in a mental institution where the Nightmares dine on a smourgesbourg of manias and disorders.  The asylum's experiments did something that armed the inmates with powers beyond the pale.  Now able to challenge their demented captors the inmates find themselves one step closer to becoming like the Nightmares they fear.  We'll flesh out the characters at the table through a few simple questions and start this game with one foot out the door of damnationa ; with a die of permanent madness.<br/><br/>Title: \u201cThe Fall of the House of the Unconquered Son\u201d<br/>System: Mist-Robed Gate<br/>Players: 2 - 4<br/>Description: Exalted with a storytelling twist.  Using the innovative game, Mist-Robed Gate we tell a tale of a Perfect Circle haunted by their past.  Hounded by a Dragon Blooded army the Chosen of the Unconquered Son must restore a sacred temple now in ruins but are faced with the sins they commited in former lives.  Fans of the Exalted setting are a must.  Bring the setting to life while using the freedom to shape the world as you see it.  Create your own Anima, Charms and weild weapons of power limited only by your imagination.  This system is not for the sqeamish.  We will use it to tell tales of betrayal, debauchery, love and tragedy.   Knowledge of Wuxia/Hong Kong action tropes a plus and a willingness to bring the fun to the table a must.<br/><br/>Title: \u201cThe Cradle Will Fall\u201d<br/>System: D&amp;D 4e (DMG)<br/>Players: 4-8<br/>Description: Using the ancient scrolls of a lost empire the Paladins of Erathis summon forth the souls of the past to rebuild the ruined cities.  In their way are the tribal remnants of the slave revolt that toppled the empire so long ago.  This is not your mother's D&amp;D.  No miniatures.  No grid.  Using much of the wisdom from the DMG we tell a story from both sides of the conflict.  We're looking for players interested only in the roles of Storyteller and Instigator (DMG pgs 8 &amp; 9), weaving tales using the Skill Challenge rules and other gems in the DMG.  This game is merely moderated by a GM with all the action driven by the players.  Characters provided.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170822/#Comment_170822" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T19:56:32+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  7:56PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am going to write up the descriptions for Luke's BW and BE demos Friday night.<br/><br/>Mike Miller will be running his usual hotness:<br/><br/>TIME: Saturday 8am to Noon<br/>TITLE: "Let Slip the Bricks of War"<br/>SYSTEM: Mechaton<br/>PLAYERS: 2-9<br/>Part of the Indie Games Explosion!
