I remember telling one guy "Look, seriously, if you're going to stare at our books you might as well take a load off while you do it. Come on, sit down, I'll show you a menu and you can stop squinting." </blockquote>\nI replied:\n<blockquote>I really like the comment about the chairs. I'm going to be selling for the first time at a convention in October. My stall is supposed to be in the middle of the floor, like a demo table, and I'm really scared. When I read your post I decided that I'm going to try to set it up as a comfy place instead of a sales place. I'll bring in some extra cushions so people can chill out there, use the table space as a place to play other people's indie games (not just my own), and so on. If I'm comfortable, I think my customers can be comfortable. Do you think that this is a good idea? </blockquote>\nThen Elizabeth told me:\n<blockquote>100%. But if you're doing this, do something like the Design Matters menu: definitely have something for people to flip through and look at the games at their own pace, and then they can ask you for information or for a demo. </blockquote>\nIf I only have one product on sale, what can I offer them to flip through, would you guys suggest?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288204/#Comment_288204" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T23:36:32+00:00" title="August 22, 2010 11:36PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want to spend $1000-1600+ to give people a nice place to sit, that's your every right.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

It's a useful sales tool. It keeps people rooted while we can answer their questions, makes them feel at home, and unconsciously connects the idea of relaxation and comfort t the game matter they are looking at. <br/><br/>That said, you don't want to create a place that people can be taking up space and not being interested in your games, and it's hard to ask people to move on and not look like a dick. It's fine when it's not busy, but when it is, we try to stand near the chairs to dissuade folks from sitting and keep the turnaround at a good clip.<br/><br/>I'm also pretty anti-demo, but that's another thing to talk about.

You know, quiet, chilled out, a place for people to put their feet up and read, maybe throw a few dice at the target, that sort of thing.

The table will either be set up alongside traders (and will therefore be at the edge of the hall, against the wall, as in the diagram above) or in the centre of the main hall (and probably be on its own, or sidled up to another special event, like "the battle of Hoth" miniature wargame demo, or something). If I have the latter, I'll be able to do anything I want, really. If I get the former, I'll have different constraints. The question I have, though, is what angle to go for? Do I try to make it comfy place where people can chill out , borrow games and play demos of Hell for Leather, or do I use the stall primarily as a point of sale (demoing throughout the day, or at scheduled times, but not using it for a place for people to relax)?<br/><br/>So far, I am assuming that it is a lefty idea to offer people a place to chill out but that it will not be good for business. Can someone comment on this assumption? How do you use stalls? Do you want to be able to sit and read at them, or do you prefer to take stuff away?

That's why you are there, that's what the con organizers want, that's when attendees will expect.

To buff it up, I'll draw two numbers for the raffle. The winning two players will have to compete in a short head-to-head dice stacking deathmatch for the prize.<br/><br/>Okay, thanks to this thread, I am convinced that my message should be "sell." Here is my plan:<br/><br/>* Stick to the traditional rig (to keep the customers comfortable)<br/>* Keep moving around (standing up, smiling, waving and nodding), engage with the gaming folks (seeing what's going on in the con, offering suggestions) and be enthusiastic<br/>* Learn about the games for sale at other booths and be enthusiastic about those too<br/>* Make the stall scream "Hell for Leather," schedule short demos at regular periods and have those announced on the intercom<br/>* Post a schedule on the booth (so I can take breaks and refresh)<br/>* Bring a stack of indie games and play the shit out of them with strangers <b>away from my booth</b><br/>* Use the selling advice from Graham's other thread<br/><br/>That's the initial rig. If I feel that it might benefit from a more hippy vibe, maybe I'll shake things up on the second day.<br/><br/>Jason, in answer to your 'disingenuous' comment, you're right, people can smell insincerity a mile away. But I'm not kidding. I don't care about sales. You know why? I'm terrified. I'm terrified that if I try to shmooze people, they will end up buying something they don't want and hate me for it. I worked in marketing for an international telecommunications company for nearly two years. It was all a big lie. All their products were shit, and we, me and the sales teams, had to push them at ignorants. Every month as I saw the lies get bigger and the products stay the same. I saw them delivered and, after some months, we started to see the complaints. I could feel the avalanche coming. Suddenly, the bubble burst. Thousands of calls were coming in everyday with complaints. We had to outsource two call-centres just to keep up. Why? The sales, while hot, sharp and sexy, were built on lies and opacity. Then, of course, there was the fallout. Total, fucking, mayhem.<br/><br/>I still work in the selling business, but now I do it the other way around. I sell for the long term. I work in a restaurant and I tell people what I think they'll hate, what I think is bad value, and the best ways for people to enjoy their experience both fiscally and otherwise. Short term loss, long term profit. It's not altruistic. It's just a mixture of terror and common sense. So, when I say I don't care about the sales, I'm not saying "I'm not selling." It's not my priority to move the produce quickly. It's my priority to move the produce properly.<br/><br/>I started this thread to find out out what that means. I guess the answer is 'with personality, honesty and enthusiasm.' And gimmicks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288373/#Comment_288373" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T16:38:23+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  4:38PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sebastian K.

It might, maybe work in some very limited circumstances, but there are simply too many ways to make people feel uncomfortable when you force them down onto the floor like that, including whether they're dressed for it, how clean the floor stays the whole time, and even whether they're physically ABLE to just plop up and down like that.<br/><br/>You might consider swinging that table 90 degrees so it's along the SIDE of your booth, allowing you to put chairs or stools inside but inviting people in anyway. We never do the table out front thing, we try to create a 'mini store' that people can browse, but it's always a challenge to get them to cross that threshold.<br/><br/>As to being a place to just 'hang out', ask yourself this: If the least desirable person at that show chose to sit in your booth for 2 hours and it wouldn't bother you, consider it. Otherwise, find a way to engage people for a specific amount of time and transition them on if it becomes necessary.<br/><br/>-Jim Crocker, retailer<br/>(and vendor at half a dozen Cons)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288526/#Comment_288526" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T13:37:25+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  1:37PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Luke">@Luke</a> That foam tile stuff is an absolute must - for the traders at the very least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288702/#Comment_288702" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T08:55:27+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  8:55AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Being a pushy salesman is basically hassling the customer...so while you probably won't want to do that to the nice people who wander in and wander out, you should at least consider it as an option for the rude ones who really NEED to be hassled. </blockquote>\nTotal gold. That's the funkiest advice I've seen in this thread. It will stick in my head throughout the whole con, and it will, I'm sure, make me giggle to myself. Thanks hombre.<br/><br/>As for the GIANT DICE suggestion. They're on the way in the post. I had a chat with the con organisers and we're going to arrange a kind of live-action Big version of Hell for Leather (with prizes) between one of the gaming slots. The guys are very supportive and they want me to make as much excitement as I can. My floor space will be changed and moved throughout the day as I run one or two table events.<br/><br/>This is exciting, and helps me to understand my role at the convention a little better: Entertainer. So, in knowing that, I'm going to set up the table with the giant dice nearby, dress it nicely, offer people little demos, run a raffle, run the big version as a special event, use three slots for gaming demos and have Jason Hickey detail some of the prints at scheduled times (so folks can watch him at work). Stuff like that.<br/><br/>As for the stall, I'm going to lay it out so that I don't piss any of the retailers off, and I'm also going to try to cut a deal with one of the sellers (directing my customers to him for components) so that I don't have to bring all the fiddle buts myself (and yet there will be enough fiddly bits for my customers). Hopefully that will foment a bit of goodwill between us.<br/><br/>Thanks again for all the advice. I'll jump back here to report in November.<br/><br/>Sebastian.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.
