Problem is that it's a PvP game.  But you could use the figures for different purposes, I guess.  He ended up liking <a href="http://www.berengad.com/blog/?p=66" rel="nofollow">Super Mario Prime</a> a lot, which I whipped up really quickly.  <br/><br/>When my stepsons were younger, I made a game specifically for them because DnD was too complex.  That was 8 years ago, and I don't think I have any of it left.  But it was just a very basic roll-to-hit thing with hit points.  Then I made cards (found images online, printed on cardstock) for weapons and armor (again, very simple: +1 to +3 to damage for weapons, frex).  That really excited them, being able to take a card from an enemy and put it on their sheet. Making that took me a little longer, but it was worth it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309103/#Comment_309103" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T10:40:48+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 10:40AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out John Harper's Wildlings.

We made paper dolls of the Scooby gang and the team of witches and ghosts that they were fighting, and drew black and white stones to resolve conflicts between pairs of characters. (Four stones in hand, draw a stone each "round", first side to get two stones of their color knocks their opponent out of the game.) Oh yeah, we went through each of the characters and I asked her what each of them likes, or what they wanted, and used those to set up why they were fighting. (Shaggy likes sandwiches, Velma likes blueberries, the ghost wants to kill them, the witch with the pigtails wants to sing, etc.) So each turn, I just had her pick two of them and tell me why they were fighting - "the witch with the curly hair is trying to take Fred's pizza by biting him" - and do the stones thing.<br><br/>Oh yeah! When someone lost, she ripped up their paper doll with great relish. There was a lot of shooting fire at people and melting them with water (poor Daphne) and stinging people's eyes with bees and shooting Spider-Man webs at people, until most of the Scooby gang was in pieces on the floor, but Velma pulled through by killing the pretty witch by cutting holes in her, and catching the ghost with glue. Then, in the aftermath, Velma went home and cut her hair and ate some blueberries. (Afterwards, she asked me if she could rip Velma up, and when I said, "but, she won!", she said, "awwww! But I wanted the witches to win!" Nice.)                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309128/#Comment_309128" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T13:42:45+00:00" title="January 22, 2011  1:42PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Do you need rules for that, Matthijs?

The rules are very short, so I present them here in their entirety; please critique.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Aregost</b><br/>\nYou wil need to prepare for this game in advance by writing up a bunch of blank index cards to serve as the various card types described below, but you shouldn't need more than about 30 cards altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the start of the game, each player chooses 1 Class card from Warrior, Thief or Magician:<br/>\n<b>Warrior: </b>Can avoid or defeat monsters and defeat doors when \u2018Ready\u2019; may help with monsters when \u2018Waiting\u2019.<br/>\n<b>Thief:</b> Can avoid or defeat traps and avoid doors when \u2018Ready\u2019; may help with traps when \u2018Waiting\u2019.<br/>\n<b>Wizard:</b> Can avoid anything when \u2018Ready\u2019; may help with anything when \u2018Waiting\u2019.<br/>\nEach player puts their chosen Class card in front of them with the \u2018Ready\u2019 side face up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM draws 2, 3 or 4 Trouble cards per player from her deck and starts the story; it is the GM's job to keep the story going throughout the game, so this is best taken on by an imaginative adult. At any point in the story, the GM may play a Trouble card from her hand in front of any uncaught player, describing exactly what it type of trouble the player finds themselves in. Trouble cards come in three types: Monsters, Traps &amp; Doors.<br/>\n<b>Monster:</b> Any creature which may attack the heroes, e.g. ghosts, goblins, bears, dragons, clockwork soldiers, etc.<br/>\n<b>Trap:</b> Anything designed to slow the heroes down, e.g. a pit to be jumped, swinging blades to dodge, a lightning storm, quicksand, etc..<br/>\n<b>Door:</b> Any obstacle than can bar their progress, e.g. a prison cell, a sheer cliff face, the sea, a wall with a secret door in it, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a Trouble card is played, the target player must choose how to respond to it; the player and the GM must also describe between them what happens to the hero and the trouble they face.<br/>\n<i>Avoid it:</i> Flip one Class card from \u2018Ready\u2019 to \u2018Waiting\u2019 and put the Trouble card in front of the GM, on their Avoided pile.<br/>\n<i>Defeat it: </i>Flip two Class cards from \u2018Ready\u2019 to \u2018Waiting\u2019 and flip the Trouble card over to its Treasure side; the player keeps the Treasure.<br/>\n<i>Get caught: </i>Do nothing; the Trouble card is placed on top of the player\u2019s Class cards. A player who has been caught may not flip any cards until they are rescued by their friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers may help each other out of Trouble; when another player has a Trouble card played on them but can\u2019t or won\u2019t flip any of their Class cards to avoid or defeat it, their friends may flip any of their Class cards from \u2018Waiting\u2019 to \u2018Ready\u2019 in order to do so. Players may also work together, so that if any two players flips one card each, the Trouble is defeated and the target player gets the Treasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a player is caught, then they must be rescued by their friends, but the Trouble must be defeated, not avoided; anytime a caught player is rescued, they get to take an extra Class card and the GM draws an extra Trouble card. The player who rescued them gets to take the Treasure; if two players help each other to rescue a friend, they must decide between them who gets the Treasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all the players are caught at any time, so that none may flip cards, the GM may ask the players if they want to end the game there or carry on; if they carry on, all the Trouble cards which caught the players are added to the GM\u2019s Avoided pile and she draws 1 more Trouble card per player.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reverse of every Trouble card is a Treasure, which also come in three types: Weapons, Items and Spells.<br/>\n<b>Weapon:</b> As long as you have a weapon, you may flip one Warrior card or any two other Class cards to defeat a Monster or help to defeat one. Weapons are found on the reverse of Traps &amp; Doors.<br/>\n<b>Item:</b> As long as you have an item, you may flip you may flip one Thief card or any two other Class cards to defeat a Trap or help to defeat one. Items are found on the reverse of Monsters &amp; Doors.<br/>\n<b>Spell: </b>As long as you have a spell, you may flip one Wizard card to defeat any card or help to defeat one. Spells are found on the reverse of Monsters &amp; Traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the GM no longer has any Trouble cards in her hand, she picks up all the cards in her Avoided pile; if there are none, she takes back all the Trouble cards from all caught players; if there are none, the game is over and the heroes have won the day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309202/#Comment_309202" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T05:19:36+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  5:19AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remids me of <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://axecop.com/index.php/acepisodes/read/episode_1/" rel="nofollow">Axe Cop</a>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309205/#Comment_309205" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T05:47:13+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  5:47AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was really young, I played with action figures but had no children that lived near me.
