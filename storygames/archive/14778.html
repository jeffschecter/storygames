Fiction is the imaginary, possibly shared, content of play. Narrative on the other hand is the use of "normal" language (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language" rel="nofollow">natural language</a>) to communicate about the fiction. <br/><br/>Games introduce their own language for communication - either from the elements of the game or the emerging dynamics of systems which act as recognizable patterns which receive novel linguistic titles. Just think of what the phrase "Roll Initiative" signifies for an experienced traditional gamer. <br/><br/>From the fiction perspective, the goal is to communicate the changing fiction among the players. This goal is agnostic of whether free narrative, mechanics, or some mixture of the two is used. What matters is the social context and effectiveness of the communication. Natural language is rife with ambiguities which can hinder communicating fiction - consider all the possible interpretations of "staring into someone's eyes". On the other hand, mechanics often present more abstraction, which introduces its own communication difficulties. <br/><br/>In practice what happens during play is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-game" rel="nofollow">Language Game</a>, where players interact and develop their own ways to effectively communicate fiction from the dual foundation of narrative and game system. Some groups may tend towards one or the other. Ambiguity and abstraction is an important part of this, the play in fiction with respect to what is said and done during play is essential - this enables players to establish without fully or over determining which would provide a barrier to other players responding and contributing. <br/><br/>As for design and analysis of games, I've been using a linguistic perspective as a valuable part of my theory/practice tool box for a few years. Looking at games like various editions of D&amp;D and Apocalypse World this way has been extremely helpful. Also observing the process of the language game during play is, if anything, even more telling. Forge theory doesn't really deal with change in play, but from this perspective all play involves change - to the social dynamics, goals and aesthetics, fiction, and most importantly the shared language game that drives all of these things. <br/><br/>Design-wise, I'm very interested in making games with systems that offer an alternative language - from which otherwise complex concepts and relationships can be easily encapsulated, examined, and confronted. To my mind, one of the greatest potentials of this approach to design is the prospect of creating novel and meaningful forms of fiction made from building blocks which no other media can produce.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336271/#Comment_336271" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T12:33:14+00:00" title="July 28, 2011 12:33PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mind = blown<br/><br/>I was just thinking (before i even read this) on my way to lunch, about how i personally consider it a victory if a game gives you an idiom that can be re-used as jargon outside of the game context to capture an emotion, response, or expression (mostly to others who have played the same game, obviously).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336988/#Comment_336988" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T11:02:57+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 11:02AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/><br/>\tSorry I fell off the map there.

He describes all conversation this way, including jokes, to show that his earlier work in the Tractatus and language atomists are wrong. I\u2019m worried that you are trying to make this analogy do too much work, or use it in reverse.

The way people speak to each other during a roleplaying game is distinct from how those same people speak to each other when catching up or chatting about movies.<br/><br/>And yes, you could say that every circumstance of communication could (and should) produce its own particular language-game, but I think it's helpful to acknowledge that there are certain situations where the division is much stronger, and constructed more deliberately. It is immediately obvious to the participants in a roleplaying game that they are going to have to modify their language use in some way, in the same way that it is obvious to most people who go to an art gallery that they should look at the paintings differently than they look at items in the supermarket.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337001/#Comment_337001" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T12:11:27+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 12:11PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what Mathalus is trying to say by invoking the Language Game term is that part of what we do when playing a game is to use terminology that has been given specific meaning within that specific game:<br/><br/>Roll initiative.

Specifically, he was attacking an account of language he himself defended in the early 1920\u2019s where he had once argued that the structure of the sentence mirrored the structure of the world. <br/><br/>So: on such a conception of language, \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d is an appropriate thing to say since in the world the item designated by \u201ccat\u201d is in the relationship designated by \u201con\u201d with the item designated by \u201cmat\u201d. Which is to say, bits of language (i.e. words) in legitimate sentences are structured in sentences in the same way the objects those words represent are structured in the world. <br/><br/>In later work, Wittgenstein rejected this theory of language by instead arguing that language was more like a game. The utterance \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d is an appropriate because of how the words \u201ccat\u201d \u201con\u201d and \u201cmat\u201d work (like how pawns, kings, and castles work in chess) and how the conversation has proceeded previous to your utterance of the sentence that \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d. It isn\u2019t some mirroring relationship to the world that makes a sentence appropriate, but the rules of the \u201clanguage game\u201d. For example, \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d is the utterance that obeys certain rules of conversation, such as: \u201cBe concise\u201d, \u201cBe relevant\u201d, \u201cBe truthful\u201d etc. The word \u201ccat\u201d is appropriate in this utterance not because it represents cats in some special way, but because the word has rules pertaining to its use that make it a legitimate move in conversation when cats are around. <br/><br/>One might worry that all of this leads to some sort of relativism about truth, but Wittgenstein would reject such a position too since the word \u201ctruth\u201d is itself just a piece in the language game and one that happens to behave according to an absolutist conception of truth (versus a relativist conception). The word \u201ctruth\u201d has rules for it\u2019s use just like \u201ccat\u201d and rules that make a relativistic conception of truth nonsense. <br/><br/>More generally, an important part of what Wittgenstein was doing in his later work was rejecting traditional philosophical debates altogether (e.g. relativism vs. absolutist conceptions of truth) by claiming that they are merely the result of failing to pay attention to ordinary conversation and what the rules of the ordinary language game happen to be. Another thing Wittgenstein was doing was rejecting his earlier view that there was some ideal language that we really mean in ordinary conversation and in which our ordinary utterances can be translated into. <br/><br/><b>SECOND:</b><br/>Which is all to say, Wittgenstein wasn\u2019t just saying \u201chey, think about language as a game\u201d. He was making a specific point in a very complex discussion that philosophers were having about the nature of language. Furthermore, he was objecting to a certain view of language that was dominate at the time that Wittgenstein himself advocated in his early career. What I take Mathalus to have been asking, and what I will join him in asking, is what do YOU mean by invoking Wittgenstein\u2019s idea of a \u201clanguage game\u201d? I know what Wittgenstein was doing with such an analogy between games and language, but I can\u2019t make heads-or-tails of what you are up to.<br/><br/>If your only point is that the language we use in playing games involves their own technical terminology, then your point is trivial. Furthermore, your point has absolutely no relation to Wittgenstein\u2019s point about language games. The fact that \u201croll imitative\u201d is a piece of technical terminology for games has nothing to do with the idea of \u201clanguage games\u201d. <br/><br/>As far as your point about \u201cambiguity\u201d and \u201cabstraction\u201d, I suspect you are just making a point about how the ambiguity of my statements in a story game can be fleshed out by other players later in the game in ways I didn\u2019t intend. I.e., that my statements do not constrain players as much as one might think because they are ambiguous. I agree with you here, but again I don\u2019t see the connection to Wittgenstein\u2019s notion of a language game. Futhermore, I don\u2019t know what the importance of drawing our attention to such a point would be. <br/><br/><b>THIRD:</b><br/>So maybe your use of the idea of a language game is misplaced, I grant that. So let\u2019s forget Wittgenstein. But even then, I don\u2019t know what you are saying. What do you mean by the sentence: \u201cI\u2019m very interested in making game systems that offer an alternative language\u201d? Do you just want to introduce as much technical terminology as possible? That seems like a horrible idea. No physicist or chemist thinks introducing more technical terminology just for the sake of having more technical terminology is a good idea. Specialists introduce technical terminology because they need too, not to create a new \u201clanguage game\u201d (which is itself a misuse of Wittgenstein\u2019s term). <br/><br/>This is a harsh post, I admit that. I am sorry for that. But I want you to drop the obscure and abstract references to linguistics and \u201clanguage games\u201d and just tell us in as dumbed down way as you can what you mean. Explain to me like you would explain to a 5th grader what you are up to, because you are talking in so much obscurity now that you aren\u2019t communicating anything. <br/><br/>Okay, putting my plea for clarity aside, here\u2019s my attempt to try and put Wittgenstein\u2019s notion of a language game to use in constructing story games (as you assert we should do):<br/><br/>In ordinary conversation, Wittgenstein points out that we are playing a sort of game. I make a move in the game ("What time is it?"), and you have certain legitimate responses open to you ("I don't know." or you might report what time it is). It is a part of this game that we be honest, be informative, be concise as possible, etc., etc. Now, the "game" of conversation works a bit different when we play story games. For example, I don't need to be honest anymore in the sense that we are creating a fictional world as we describe it. The world is whatever I say it is, so the demand that I be honest is obviously not operative. <br/><br/>Also, co-created fictions like in story games seem to have certain rules of conversation unique to them. You don't have to honesty describe the real world as you are having this conversation with your fellow story gamers, BUT you do need to stay consistent with what they've said and maybe obey dice rolls (or whatever game mechanic is in place for determining the fictional world). <br/><br/>Furthermore, when I say I am wearing a blue scarf (while playing a story game) I am being ambigious (as we always are with anything we say). How I am wearing it, what it is made of, what it\u2019s political significance is in my culture are all left undetermined. So someone else can still be consistent with what I've said even if  they add something to the fictional world that I didn't expect, like: "But you are wearing it around your arm as a symbol of resistence!" I suppose that in ordinary conversation, ambiguity is problematic because it fails to fully communicate how the world actually is, but in this case where we are co-creating a fictional world it is a good thing since this allows others to play with what I've added to the world in unexpected ways. When I say "I'm wearing a blue scarf" I don't know what that contribution will really amount to in the fictional world since someone else might flesh out the ambiguity of my statement in unexpected ways.<br/> <br/>So, yes, the rules of the language game work differently in conversations where we are co-creating fictions than in conversations where we are talking about the real world or trying to fix a car or discussing politics. If that is your point, then I think it is interesting. Although, I\u2019d like to see you discuss it with less obscurity. <br/><br/>However, I still don\u2019t see what roll it would play in game design. It is an interesting point that the rules of conversation might be different when two or more people are co-creating a fictional world than when they are describing the actual world, but I don\u2019t know how that affects game design. You say you find it helpful to think about\u2026 okay, how so? Or am I misunderstanding your point? Are you saying something else? <br/><br/><b>LASTLY:</b><br/>Honestly, I don\u2019t think you said anything at all in your first post. It was completely obscure. You might have an absolutely genius point that you are making, and I\u2019d like to hear it, but from what you\u2019ve said so far I don\u2019t understand it at all. Furthermore, I understand the notion of \u201clanguage games\u201d and I think that putting forth your idea in those terms just further obscures your point. Can you tell us (me, really), what you are thinking without the notion of a language game? Maybe with specific examples of where it has helped you in game design? I suspect you DO have an interesting point to make, but I think you have just expressed it poorly. Maybe my post will help you solidify and express what you have in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337217/#Comment_337217" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T20:45:11+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  8:45PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew (graypawn), I agree, it is an exciting prospect, to produce through the interplay of the social, imaginary, and mechanical the means turn a complex, nuanced idea or feeling into something that serves, not as the purpose of a conversation, but as its foundation. <br/><br/><br/>Morgan, <br/><br/>I understand, life (and Game Chef) will cause delays. <br/><br/>One of the first points I'm trying to make, with both the reference to language games and distinguishing narrative from fiction is that communication does not occur solely by talk, and communication of fiction is not confined to literary and theatric forms of speech. Narrating or acting out the fiction are only a few tools available for communicating fiction and they are even more limited in communicating everything else occurring in play - such as our feelings, reflections, and relationships with our fellow players.<br/><br/>While numerous other outside languages can lend a hand such as body and speech mannerisms ( e.g. Tomas' dialogue techniques), ritual language and behavior, many and various forms of non-fiction, and so on. A creative group will produce a distinct language game from these and other resources. For RPGs in particular the mechanics of play provide a distinctive way to reference and describe the dynamic behaviors within the fiction and among the players. <br/><br/>(Note, this actively constructed, dynamic, and distinct mode of communication overlaps so well with Wittgenstein's examples of a language game it is difficult to produce an alternative label for it.)<br/><br/>In the next day or so I should be able to give some specific examples about how the design and play of RPGs influences the language game of play.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337220/#Comment_337220" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T21:05:29+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  9:05PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, examples!<br/><br/>That makes it much more interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337391/#Comment_337391" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T21:02:46+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  9:02PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, <br/><br/>Exactly, the language game for a given group's play is constructive from many sources, is distinctly situational to the needs and interests of the group, the underlying systems, and even the desired fiction. The only thing I would add is to remember the language game does not come into being whole cloth, but emerges and changes based on the situation - this isn't immediately essential but links the linguistic perspective with another approach I've taken to understanding design and play.<br/><br/><br/>Rob, <br/><br/>The addition of system, and mechanics in particular to play is not limited to new, technical terms. The processes, the implied outcomes, and the other dynamics lend new meanings to otherwise simple game and non game terms. Consider in Fiasco how the prospect of a black versus white die influences and informs the narration involved in resolving a scene. And clearly the use of mechanics to communicate fiction is not limited to description - picking up a die of a certain color in Fiasco or handing a player the Demons dice for their conflict in Dogs in the Vineyard express something definite and very meaningful about the fiction without saying another word.<br/><br/><br/>Johnstone, <br/><br/>Adding particular language to mechanics is certainly relevant, but my main interest is how do the dynamics of play enrich the potential means of communication, often by capturing otherwise complex ideas and behaviors.<br/><br/><br/>Andrew (rah),<br/><br/>Welcome to Story Games! <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> contains several examples of language games, which present the situational, dynamic, and constructive qualities in a language game. I'm using the term to refer to those aspects of a language game, because I strongly expect that a lay interpretation of a language of play does not incorporate these aspects. <br/><br/>As for abstraction and ambiguity I'll get into that later if the opportunity presents. These both behave subtley in communication, but to really expose why involves some information and complexity theory, which is admittedly a big shift from even analytic philosophy. <br/><br/>I do appreciate you giving the folks here a brief synopsis of the history of the language game. I hope that these responses give you a better understanding of the approach to play and design I'm proposing. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rah" title="rah"><img alt="rah" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rah">rah</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337707/#Comment_337707" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T20:16:13+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  8:16PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I look forward to your examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337784/#Comment_337784" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T08:38:30+00:00" title="August  9, 2011  8:38AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338858/#Comment_338858" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T09:47:03+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  9:47AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I'm going to focus on right now is the importance of mechanics in communicating fiction. There is more going on with communication and the construction of language during play, but this is a gateway to better understanding. <br/><br/>Mechanics as language occurs at multiple levels, the simplest being the adoption of mechanics as coining and transforming the verbal language of play. This is what my earlier example of "roll Initiative" demonstrates, as well as the adoption of mechanical terms into the spoken language of play. The first time, I saw how intentional design could affect this process of building a verbal language unique to the game and the group was when I ran a playtest of one of my 24 hour RPGs, <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/savagery" rel="nofollow">Savagery</a>*, which is built on a set of social combat mechanics. During the course of explaining the game and making characters we found ourselves having a discussion of the game mechanics focusing on the correct way to describe our discussion and arguments with those same game mechanics. What revealed itself during that discussion was how the mechanics were in many cases more precise about the motives and desired consequences than the actual words being used. <br/><br/>So when you brutalize a person, by using your empathy to guess where they are vulnerable to emotional pain, you are crafting fiction in a distinct, but powerful way than narrating or acting out a remark about her shoes. And the reason for this is that while narration and acting have the potential for subtext, connotation, and emotional impacts, a mechanic describes a <i>trajectory</i>, movement and possibility in fiction. And while enough words can describe that movement, they cannot do so as succinctly and as directly as the mechanic which govern that movement and possibility. <br/><br/>Before I continue on to how this impacts design, I want to make sure that this point is sufficiently clear. Mechanics provide a uniquely powerful tool in communicating fiction among players. This is why mechanics become part of the language game of a play group. Because once a mechanic demonstrates or is seen to provide a particular fictional trajectory it becomes a way to communicate that trajectory. I'm willing to continue with examples on this point before getting to design if they are needed. <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><br/>* Most of my examples here and further on are of my own design, because I spend a fair amount of my gaming time playing those games and I've explored the relationship between system and language in my design. The alternative, as I can see it, is to not talk about the majority of the relevant play and games I am aware of. But if this impoliteness offends, I'll see what I can do. Avoiding the impoliteness of "shameless self-promotion" is one of the reasons I hardly ever post in these forums any more, as it means cutting out about half of my play experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338860/#Comment_338860" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T09:52:20+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  9:52AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did anyone else think that this post was going to be about Absinthe induced hallucinations talking to the OP after reading the title of the post?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338920/#Comment_338920" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T13:22:06+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  1:22PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally on board so far.<br/><br/>And I don't see any issue with you discussing specific games, so long as you give enough context for what you are describing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338955/#Comment_338955" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T17:22:31+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  5:22PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/>\tThanks for slowing it down a bit.

Sure, mechanics-use is a distinct channel of inter-player communication.  Ditching that channel hurts some possibilities for play, especially those things that mechanics are particularly good/concise at communicating.  What are those?  Possible outcomes, and thus trajectories toward those.<br/><br/>When you narrate a dark cave and creepy monster, and I narrate a charge toward it, we're communicating <i>some</i> things pretty clearly (sensory details, tone, attitude, excitement).  Then when I pick up my dice and say, "I'm going to Press to withing Close Range" we're communicating <i>other</i> things clearly (in this case, we know that getting in Close will expose the PC to more risk but also enable his One-Hit Kill move).  Without mechanics, the attempt to get in close and achieve all that comes with that might either (a) be poorly communicated or (b) take a long time to communicate.<br/><br/>I also like the spoken words, "What's your intent?  Here are my expectations," for that.  But there's no denying that mechanics are faster and more foolproof and leave your mouth (and maybe the corresponding part of your brain) freer to narrate sensory details, tone, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339121/#Comment_339121" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T20:07:13+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  8:07PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam--I">@Adam--I</a> think it's more that when you play a game where the Intelligence stat has an impact on remembering things due to the mechanic for memory being d20 + INT, you're accepting a game rule as shorthand for the way the real world may or may not work. Everyone has to accept this rule as true before you can play the game. It's a construct that you use to suspend disbelief, play out a game, tell a story, or whatever you think you're doing when you role play.<br/><br/>In the real world (whatever that means), we humans are capable of remembering things. There is a concept that we refer to as intelligence, and our experience with the world and other humans sharing information is that intelligence may be linked to remembering things. Intelligence is just a piece of language representing some ineffable concept. It may or may not be related to one's memory.<br/><br/>In the constructed world of a game, there might be a rule that says "Intelligence helps a character remember things". The ambiguity is gone--however it works in the real world is of no concern. To facilitate gameplay and eliminate ambiguities, a set-in-stone rule covering memory has been established. It doesn't matter how you think memory works in the real world, or how experts think memory works in the real world, or even how memory actually works in the real world. All that matters is how the game says memory works.<br/><br/>TL;DR: I don't think Mendel is saying that mechanics shape how we think. I think Mendel is saying that mechanics are a constructed shorthand representing how some concept works in the real world, without being related or concerned to how that concept actually works.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm off base.

Sometimes we use a mechanic and know exactly how an outcome was arrived at in-fiction, and sometimes we use a mechanic and have no idea how the fiction wound up where it did.  Filling in that gap can be done separately by individual players, out loud as a group, or not at all (because we can keep playing without it).<br/><br/>I mention this primarily because I think it's a pretty important part of the "game as communication" equation.  "What should the players communicate about?" strikes me as a pretty fundamental game design question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340457/#Comment_340457" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T10:58:11+00:00" title="August 25, 2011 10:58AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a few interesting threads through this discussion, so it seems worthwhile to outline where things are going for a bit.<br/><br/>Currently, I've been focusing on how mechanic offer a uniquely powerful way to communicate about fiction during play. I'm trying to sketch this relationship in play and design.<br/><br/>But this is just a piece of the overall "language-oriented" way of thinking about RPGs and play. Mechanics, narrative, and theatrics, are not the only ways to communicate during play - more general systems (like agreed upon procedures in play), references to shared fictional and non-fictional events, and social contexts are all available to be part of the language of play. Likewise far more is communicated in play than fiction, indeed it could be argued that the sole purpose of the fiction in play is to itself add to the language of play for communicating far more important things.<br/><br/>One step beyond this, as a way of looking at play on its own is to walk the direction that Adam and Garret are describing - that our ways of communicating and expressing are often used beyond their original domains - reflectively with ourselves and externally with others. How we express our thoughts affects those thoughts*. And fiction is a potent tool for changing our own minds, after all we seem to be hard wired to treat stories as evidence of truth.

The next layer would be that the existence of words creates the potential for ideas.  I would recommend listening to that podcast I linked earlier, it's pretty much all fascinating if you like the topic of words and thought.<br/><br/>One of the sections deals with a Nicaraguan school for the deaf started in the 70's.  The kids hadn't been taught any form of sign language, but each had a few rudimentary signs they had developed with their family.  Once the kids were all in one place they eventually began sharing signs and developing their own language.  Some scientists have been studying this development for a while, it's one of the few opportunities ever to watch a language form.<br/><br/>They decided to do a simple test to measure their ability to think about thinking.  Some of the kids who started in the 70's are in their 40's now, they tested them and some of the current students using an empathy test.  They used a cartoon about two brothers, the older brother was playing with a train set.  He put the train set in the toy chest and told his younger brother not to touch it.  Once he left the room, the younger brother took it out, played with it and hid it under the bed.<br/><br/>They then asked the participants to predict where the older brother would look for the train set.  The former students in their 30's and 40's predicted the older brother would look under the bed.  The younger students in their teens, would predict that he would look in the toy chest.  When they conducted the same test a few years later, the older deaf people began to more accurately empathize with the older brother.  As the younger kids continued to develop the language in larger groups at school, they brought it with them to the broader deaf community in Nicaragua.  As the older students learned the new words, they gained the ability to have thoughts using those words.  Words about thinking allow you to think about thinking.<br/><br/>Word selection allows for more efficient and meaningful communication.<br/><br/>It's also possible to generate new concepts, sometimes with new words or meanings for words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341202/#Comment_341202" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T08:59:10+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  8:59AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2011 8:59AM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>So, while my following examples are going to be about mechanics and fiction, be aware that there is much more to this than <i>just</i> mechanics and fiction.</blockquote>Done.

The core mechanic of CoA uses three types of dice, each with a different dynamic. <br/><br/>Self dice are the simplest, they represent your true self and potential - the hero you are meant to be. On each turn you can roll one of your self dice - which can be a d20, a d12, or a d8, depending on how central they are to the character.  <br/><br/>Trouble dice are the external forces of the world, the challenges and dangers, it comes in two types Goal and Fixed. Both of these are purchased by players who can pool their points, and then are shared among everyone. Goal trouble can be anything from a dragon that needs slaying or a prince (or princess) that needs romancing - or indeed vice versa, as how you resolve a trouble is up to you. With goal trouble resolving the trouble cancels the die at its current value, but the player can usually raise the die to the next value if they want to escalate the trouble.  Fixed trouble which doesn't get resolved, but it can be avoided or mastered.  Trouble dice can range from d4 to d20 and a player can choose any number to roll on their turn - usually in describing what they are working against in their action. <br/><br/>Issue dice represent the internal forces that keep you from achieving your potential. Issue dice start at d12, and then gradually decrease through d8 and d4 until they are gone entirely. A character has three issues, all of which are rolled in a given turn.<br/><br/>The resolution mechanic has one way to succeed and many ways to fail:<br/><br/>If the self die rolls equal or above all the other dice - you are victorious and can cancel a goal die describing your victory<br/><br/>If the self die is below a trouble die - you are overcome by the trouble, but you learn a lesson, reducing your highest rolling issue die.<br/><br/>If the self die is below an issue die, but none of your trouble dice - you turn your potential victory into failure by succumbing to the highest rolling issue. <br/><br/>And since each issue can be things like "In my father's shadow" or "obsessed with romance" there is a wide room for different failure results. <br/><br/><br/>As I was writing and developing CoA, I realized one of the more difficult aspects of the game was learning the many ways the mechanical elements could represent narrative ideas. I found myself writing up what amounted to a short phrase book translating between narrative patterns and mechanical representations. <br/><br/>For example, Death presents an interesting narrative concept which gets broken down in various ways by the mechanics. If your character is dead is makes a big difference whether you present that fact as purely narrative (in which case it hardly affects you at all), as a goal trouble die (in which case it can be overcome), or as a fixed die (in which case it becomes a persistent permanent aspect of your character). Indeed, one of the settings for CoA was based on the notion that all the characters have died, and are now acting through friends, comrades, and the influence of their lives. <br/><br/>Another example is the difference between introducing a goal trouble "Love is in the Air" versus "Ophelia falls for me". In one case you are encouraging other players (due to the shared nature of trouble) to have their own romantic angles, but in the later you are offering to other players to have their characters compete to win Ophelia's love. Once you realize that this is part of the language of play, it becomes easy to signal both your immediate interests and the long term expectations and desires you want from play. On the other hand, you can imagine the problem of <i>unintentionally</i> communicating that you want competition. <br/><br/>What makes this especially powerful as a technique, is that these mechanical elements have clear dynamics, and by linking them to a narrative idea, you lend those same dynamics to that idea, saying both <i>what</i> the element is and <i>how</i> it will arise, change, and eventually resolve. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341842/#Comment_341842" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-07T10:55:01+00:00" title="September  7, 2011 10:55AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite>Here's me trying to paraphrase again:<br/><br/><b>Premise</b>: We have to talk a lot during games to get our ideas across.<br/><b>Premise</b>: Mechanics use less words for a given meaning.<br/>(Implied Premise: We don't have all goddamn day.)<br/><b>Therefore</b>: If we want to use less words but still communicate effectively we should use mechanics because they are like a shorthand.</blockquote>\nThis reminds me of <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-09/lsoa-lsv083111.php" rel="nofollow">this</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342123/#Comment_342123" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-10T01:52:14+00:00" title="September 10, 2011  1:52AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff, Mendel!  Positioning fictional facts with respect to chosen mechanics indicates the desired style of interaction.  "This is a goal trouble" says "I wan't y'all to treat it <i>this</i> way" and "this is a personal issue" says "I wan't y'all to treat it <i>that</i> way".  Right?<br/><br/>I mean, I'm skipping steps in the explanation (mechanical status -&gt; possible outcomes -&gt; attitude), but the point is, that without having a conversation about it, you nevertheless wind up with that type of understanding.  Right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
