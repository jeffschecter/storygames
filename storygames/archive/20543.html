And what I've found is that those policies have a profound effect on both what is discussed and <i>how</i>. In fact, it resembles how a set of RPG rules affect what the players focus on and think about during play.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I'm trying to create a policy which limits what/how things can be discussed to better focus on design and identity issues, much like an RPG does.<br/><br/>For example, the subject of sexual assault tends to take up all the oxygen in a room because of associated personal values and experience. But instead of forbidding the topic entirely I want to limit <i>how</i> it must be addressed to create an environment that's more like Monsterhearts and less like Tournament of Rapists. And yet I also realize that <i>any</i> moderation policy (even a non-existing one) will exclude potentially valuable members and contributions, not because it's enforced, but simply because of the environment it creates.<br/><br/>I'm still fumbling in the dark with these ideas and not even sure how much of my goal is achievable, but I'm posting here because this is about the only place I know where people would actually understand what I'm getting at and might be able to help refine it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451349/#Comment_451349" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-15T00:39:24+00:00" title="February 15, 2016 12:39AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So maybe one or more axii along which users can "rank" a post based on some stated criteria, thereby automatically affecting its placement and presentation, a la Slashdot?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451351/#Comment_451351" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-15T03:33:46+00:00" title="February 15, 2016  3:33AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What did you think of how the Forge was moderated?

I use it as a programming reference and the general currency of the site is that the question asker awards a checkmark for the answer they find most helpful. Simple enough. The aspect of it that I think might be relevant is that in addition to the "answers" there are also marginal comments which allow a back and forth discussion between the asker and the commenters. This is most helpful in clarifying the original question or asking for more information. <br/><br/>So for the situation here, you likely won't have a single definitive "right answer" in each thread, but you could have a way for the asker to highlight a handful of responses that together form a coherent position or frame the issue for future discussion. At the same time, the asker could read the marginalia and refine, clarify, or expand their original question. It can be difficult to know what you really want to ask sometimes, so it would be much more effective in the long term to be able to go back and edit the question. Another thing that can make discussions of complex issues more challenging is that forum threads are typically linear and static, so even if the commenters reach a breakthrough, later readers have to find their way through all the twists and turns of the original discussion to get to the conclusion. <br/><br/>Such a format would, however, give the question asker a great deal of authority to shape the discussion. Perhaps the asker, themselves, maintains a point score for each question that would (ideally) reflect how productive and interesting the community found that question to be.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451439/#Comment_451439" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-18T14:41:47+00:00" title="February 18, 2016  2:41PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 to all uolmir wrote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_451705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451705/#Comment_451705" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-01T16:46:16+00:00" title="March  1, 2016  4:46PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2016 4:47PM by AnonAdderlan.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so I started a Page on Facebook simply because it's the most popular social network (and the rules say you cannot use your personal profile for commercial purposes), and the first thing that hit me is that it gamifies popularity. It even mirrors free to play games where you can advance simply by playing, but you'll advance much <i>faster</i> if you pay.<br/><br/>I've also come to the conclusion that <i>tone matters</i>. The problem is it's impossible to consistently get across without context, which nobody's willing to build after the initial offence. Satire and sarcasm is all about tone, and the only thing that separates it from propaganda is you're in on the joke.<br/><br/>So what about a rule that says everything said on a board should be assumed to be sarcastic? Could you actually discuss technical concepts on such a forum? What would that look like? I'm thinking John Wick and Jared Sorensen could, but what about Ron Edwards and Cam Banks?<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure Vincent Baker could discuss anything anywhere, cause he's adaptable.\n<blockquote>What did you think of how the Forge was moderated?  I often couldn't predict what Ron would and wouldn't censor, but I knew the logic behind his decisions was "in favor of productivity".  That logic was definitely understood by many participants: "counter-productive = bad."  Even if no one agreed on what actually constituted "productivity", it was still a distinctive culture.</blockquote>\nWhile I never posted there, it was always clear to me what was acceptable, but that's because I understand people like Ron, who can be colorfully described as a deeply frustrated and condescending Vulcan. It was very much a case of knowing your GM, though he did strive to make his rules as clear and explicit as possible.<br/><br/>On the other hand many people think "Don't be a dick" is enough. It's not.\n<blockquote>The problem with generic thumbs up / thumbs down systems is that it's not clear if they signal agreement, appreciation for good writing, etc. If the forum culture is, "Only give likes/+1's/etc for posts that follow the thread rules," that could go a long way towards getting what we want here.</blockquote>\nAmbiguous communication has benefits however, and I'm even using it in my game design. Sometimes being able to imply you have good/bad feelings towards a concept without having to explain why in ways you ultimately can't makes discussion more likely in the cases where you can. It's only when people jump to conclusions that problems arise. And even when you think something is clear, you should verify it before taking action.\n<blockquote>No please, drop the<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20518/tangible-rewards-in-roleplaying-games#latest" rel="nofollow"> tanglible rewards</a>, we had enough of that in the linked thread.</blockquote>\nMy biggest fear is that the tangible awards people are most concerned with are status and authority, and I'm not sure how to turn that into an unbiased discussion of ideas and concepts.\n<blockquote>So, what about each thread starts with a list of rules stated as tags, like "no GNS", "no self-promotion", "no illusionism", "no railroading", "this is not about gender", "this is about gender", "no logical fallacies", etc.</blockquote>\nLots of 'no's here which require understanding these (to be honest very specific and politically charged) concepts before posting. I run into this with subcultural communities which also have their specific language, meanings, and taboos all the time, and it's even alienating for ostensible members of those communities.<br/><br/>For example, dd you know that 'genderbender' is offensive if used in the wrong context?

One of the biggest problems with current social networks is that they (ironically) don't give you the tools to manage your online connections and communications.

They can effectively delete any comment they want.  However, deletion is actually just purgatory, which is a state in which the comment is hidden from everyone else (except the comment-poster) but not actually deleted from the server.  Thus, the thread-starter can guarantee that their thread won't go off the rails with people replying to that comment, but the commenter also doesn't find their post deleted, full stop.  <br/><br/>While a comment is in purgatory, the thread-starter must explain why they've removed it, either by writing out an explanation, or just by clicking on one of the pre-made "Reasons" that come with the interface ("fight-starting", "derailing", "off-topic", etc.).  The commenter then has an opportunity to edit their post.  The thread-starter will be auto-notified of edits to posts they've "deleted".  If the thread-starter likes the edits, then they remove the comment from purgatory and it re-appears in the thread.

If someone removes my comment, I think I'm going to interpret that as a negative response, no matter how it's technically characterized.  "This doesn't belong here" can still be taken as an insult if the recipient is so inclined (e.g. hearing "you lack the judgment to see what belongs here").  But perhaps you're right and we could dial back the default level of judgment and disapproval, replacing it by simply noting a bad fit.  That might better convey that best intentions are assumed.  <br/><br/>As a commenter, personally, I would prefer to know specifically why my comment <i>needed</i> to be <i>removed</i>, as opposed to why it just wasn't perfect.  With that info about necessary removal, I could better learn what sorts of writing others view to be counter-productive (e.g. fight-starting, derailing, off-topic).  Being told "that was political" seems more like a one-off -- the fact that politics was unwelcome this time says nothing about whether it'll be unwelcome in the future.  <br/><br/>But maybe that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452024/#Comment_452024" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-02T18:29:32+00:00" title="April  2, 2016  6:29PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's why you need to have the option that the comment was removed (or you were banned) for <i>no reason</i>.

From that perspective, yeah, I dig your idea to have non-judgmental "reason for comment removal" defaults.  I'm just not sure what's the best way for blame-minimizing and some level of censorship to coexist.  <br/><br/>If someone tells me, "Hey, you haven't done anything wrong here, I just need to remove your comment," then that's certainly miles better than berating me or saying how I should have known better.  But it also may not cover all the necessary bases for participation.  I think Corley's right that a "no explanations, ever" policy would forestall arguments, but I think it would also kill investment.  I mean, if someone removes my half-assed comment, I won't care, but if someone removes my analysis that took me two hours, then I'm not coming back to that forum without learning how I can avoid that happening in the future.<br/><br/>I see a really direct "here's the problem with your post" procedure as a way to cover both bases.  I'm willing to accept a little bit of a "blame" element for the sake of learning.

There's a community not based around discussion in any way; you had to be there to make a game if you were going to get anywhere in any thread on the Forge.  Discussion was the format, but the restrictions on the discussion made sense in the context of the goal of the group.<br/><br/>That's why rpg.net and, inevitably, here too, fora just based around a shared enthusiasm for a set of products, will eventually fall prey to consumerism and the next-greatest-thing.  Not a lot of Primetime Adventures discussion here; and why would there be? What's there to sell us this month in Primetime Adventures?  (This is also why these "communities" can't manage political conflicts, because any psychopath can use a credit card and buy a game and have a thought about it.)<br/><br/>It should be noted that my proposed ruleset (ban people who you perceive aren't contributing well, and sometimes ban the ones who are, randomly, for no reason), even combined with a $10 user fee led to one of the biggest and longest-running fora on the net, SomethingAwful. At various times and in various subfora over the last ten years it's been a 4chan-a-like, a harassment engine, a ridiculously productive technical support forum, a pre-youtube video sharing site, and a crazy-lucrative barter forum.  It's phenomenally successful primarily because it understands that on the Internet, "someone with an opinion" is fundamentally an endlessly renewable resource and banning one or (as of today) 20,974, simply doesn't matter either to the bannee or the rest of the forums.<br/><br/>Naturally if you're trying to have a community and not just a place to discuss things, this won't work. But if all you want is discussion, if community is not on your list, fuck it, go hog wild and run it as your own authoritarian fiefdom.

But aren't most forums somewhere in between?  <br/><br/>Suppose that Story Games dies in two months after 30 consecutive threads that are basically ads or new hotness -- well, the place still had a good 10-year run as its own distinct thing, right?  And that distinctiveness came in part from the place's policies and how they were enforced.<br/><br/>If the OP can get multiple years of the sort of the discussion they want, I'd call that a big win.  And I doubt that opaque mod tyranny is the best way to achieve that.  "Someone with an opinion" is only sufficiently renewable if you have a hook that keeps drawing in the masses.
