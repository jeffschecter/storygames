Storium isn't a tabletop for playing RPGs, it's a collaborative storytelling system that borrows ideas from RPGs. It does have a system/engine but it's ultra-rules-lite, more at the level of Fiasco or The Pool; it makes even Fate Accelerated or Dungeon World look like D&amp;D 3e by comparison.<br/><br/>Part of what excites me about Storium is the crossover potential. The site pitches storytelling, not roleplaying, so it isn't going to scare away people who feel intimidated by "that D&amp;D stuff". There have been discussions here in the past about the forum RP scene and how it's a parallel world that's re-inventing story-game techniques without even realizing that story-games exist. Storium could draw that crowd in a big way and get them used to the idea of having some mechanics to guide and constrain the story.<br/><br/>I haven't started playing yet \u2014 I just put $10 into the Kickstarter, created a steampunk game and invited my kids and a good friend. I'll have a better idea of what it's like after we've played a scene or two, but I'm excited.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431326/#Comment_431326" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T09:56:06+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  9:56AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2014 11:14AM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/snej">@snej</a> I agree with you on the crossover phenomenon, and the cyclicity of these conversations over the years.

I'm guessing you're a programmer like me? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Reminds me of the proverb that "Every programming problem can be solved by adding another layer of indirection, except for the problem of having too many layers of indirection." I've seen several promising software projects die due to trying to over-generalize or make key components abstractable. Another proverb that I put a lot of weight in is "Every successful complex system has evolved out of a simpler system that worked." (Note that I'm not talking about the complexity of the ruleset, but of the software that implements the rules.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431330/#Comment_431330" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T10:09:50+00:00" title="April 20, 2014 10:09AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a>, the only way I know of to invite people is to add them to a game.

There might be a slot at the table for a Storium PDF, beside Fiasco and The Pool and Dungeon World, occupying its own cozy space and driving its own experience.

Especially for beginners, or for groups who don't know each other well. I'd love a tool like what you outlined, but I'm an experienced roleplayer. Also, I've never played any RPGs by email/forum, and it feels like I'd chafe at the slowness compared to what I'm used to. But I can get into something that's less RPG-like, where I don't have those expectations, and where I can invite friends of mine who are creative and write well but aren't familiar with RPGs.<br/><br/>Anyway, I haven't seen anything like Storium before. I've seen online tools for playing specific rulesets that are much more crunchy/tactical, with battle grids; and I've seen system-agnostic tools that are total blank slates, kind of chat rooms with a dice roller and room to upload maps. Storium is the first online thingy I've seen that's focused on stories and comes with some simple but SG-like mechanics for shaping them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431350/#Comment_431350" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T16:56:22+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  4:56PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm probably not being fair to it - my first exposure to Storium was from threads/posts (not this one) that I mentally categorized as spamming or astroturfing, so I'm extra cynical now when it comes up.

The mechanics are odd in that you often pick pretty specific strengths and weaknesses that the GM needs to incorporate in challenges, or you can end in weird instances where you're using a Strength of Charismatic Personality to diffuse a bomb or some somesuch. Otherwise, it's not bad.\ufeff<br/>My favorite part of the mechanics is that you get "wild" strengths and weaknesses that you can develop on the fly. Then, once you've used up your "hand" of cards, you can choose to pick up more of those wild cards that you just made up in the story. Instant character development without a power curve!

As opposed to just running a game on any other free pbp forum. Which is why I'm really curious about the system. Unless it's something really amazing, then there's no reason to pay to play their system on their servers. I just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>I'm not knocking the game system, I'm almost completely unfamiliar with it, but their business model seems to be: Take something that's free, <i>add value</i>, and sell it for a monthly fee.

It's got a nice interface which is built around PbP, as opposed to a message forum. It's got a lot of subtle touches, and because of the money raised, it'll be in active development for a while yet.  It's got a lot of resources to start a game. <br/><br/>Is that amazing?  Is that better than whatever you're using currently? Even if it is, is that worth one of a group of people paying $20/year?

This means picking three new Strength cards and three new Weakness cards, from among the cards you most recently played. You also receive fresh Wild Strength and Weakness cards.<br/><br/>The refresh process gives you the opportunity to shift your character\u2019s focus over time. You can do this by choosing to retain Wild cards you played previously, dropping some of your original Strength or Weakness cards to make room.<br/><br/>For example, if your character began the game with three \u201cStealthy\u201d Strength cards, and then you played a Wild Strength card called \u201cWell-connected\u201d, during the refresh process you could choose just two \u201cStealthy\u201d cards and replace the third with \u201cWell-connected\u201d card. Your character has now changed in terms of the ways they can overcome challenges in the story.<br/><br/>Since your cards refresh when used up, it is always in your interest to play all of your cards, including your Weaknesses.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>So each "refresh", you have 3 premades and one wild, but the premades shift over time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431371/#Comment_431371" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T20:56:37+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  8:56PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2014 9:34PM by liblarva.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, that's what I'm after.

In Storium, everything's an asset card. "How do I X?" questions seem to be answered often with "an asset card". "What about a relationship between two characters?" "Asset card!"<br/><br/>It doesn't read as something so robust as many of the positive reviews state. It's cool looking, don't get me wrong, but it's not something that looks like it's worth a regular subscription to use. It's something I'd pay $5 to get a fleshed out and more robust version of, sure, but a regular fee to use?

You only get a guaranteed-good result if you play some Strength cards. <br/><br/>I think the key to making this work is to really, really, REALLY respond to what others are writing and not "write to your cards", if that makes sense. Instead, go around a few times and then start going in the direction your character would go.

You are allowed to play a maximum of three cards per scene, but may keep adding bits to the story -- your play just doesn't contribute to completing the challenges. Another interesting thing is that sometimes "winning" a challenge isn't as fulfilling as "losing".

The general shape of things is that the narrator will set up a situation, then you can respond to it with a Strong, Weak or Neutral card, which defines both how well it turns out for you and who gets to say what happens. Strong is generally success, weak is generally failure, though we've definitely been set some challenges where failure is by far the more interesting option.<br/><br/>Massively over-simplified example:<br/><br/>The narrator establishes that you've walked into a room with an ogre in it. You can pick:<br/><br/>Swordsman (strong card) - You decide you want to stab it with your sword. You describe what you intend to do, and because you played a strong card you also describe how that plays out for you, presumably reasonably well since you have a strength for this specific situation.<br/><br/>Scares Easily (weak card) - You decide your character freezes in place at the sight of the ogre. You describe your failure to react well, and because you played a weak card you're in charge of listing out how that goes badly for you. It lets you control how much of a mess your character ends up in, but it means you can't wriggle out of consequences for the entire game because everyone has weak cards and everyone has to play them before they can refresh the strong cards they've used up.<br/><br/>Monster Hunter (neutral subplot card) - Your character is a monster hunter and is lacking ogre from her collection, so you decide to try and drop it in a pit trap. You describe how you set that up and maybe what you're hoping will happen, but because you played a neutral card it's up to the narrator to say how well that goes for you. It'll be subjective - maybe if your plan is really clever or there's no way that it going badly will make the story more interesting, everything will go your way, but it's equally possible that the narrator will feel an unpleasant outcome for your character is more fun for the player or the game as a whole, or will put together a 'success, but at a cost' scenario.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431570/#Comment_431570" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-24T18:35:18+00:00" title="April 24, 2014  6:35PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2014 6:37PM by Coalhada.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the *World analogy works reasonably well, because while the weak outcome might be framed as a failure in the challenge the narrator sets up, achieving the weak outcome still give the player who beats the challenge (i.e. plays the last card on it) control of the story. <br/><br/>So for both the strong and weak outcome, the player gets to say whatever they like, within the social contract of being bound by the challenge's outcome conditions. <br/><br/>It's only if you get the 'uncertain' outcome that the narrator retains control - in *World terms, gets to make as hard a move as they like. <br/><br/>Of course a lot depends on how the narrator frames the outcome options. <br/>So far I have not framed a challenge as succeed/fail in the game I'm narrating. <br/><br/>A challenge in the latest scene had the outcomes "You get the book now" or "He'll send you the information in a couple of days". <br/>If they'd played a bunch of subplots or assets and got an uncertain outcome, would I have given them nothing?

I'm seeing a big difference between the behaviour that I see as a natural fit for Storium and what a lot of other people consider to be the way it works. <br/><br/>I suspect this is because my background in online RP is from largely systemless play-by-forum, which relies heavily on a defined etiquette of what you can do to influence other people's characters and a shared understanding of who has narrative authority in any given situation. <br/><br/>To me, the Storium system provides the tools to formalise that pre-existing arrangement. To other people, it's a model of the games they've played instead. I'd be quite curious which space it's intended to inhabit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431715/#Comment_431715" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T21:00:57+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  9:00PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm enjoying Storium a lot for what it is, although I haven't decided yet if it's worth $25 a year to play it.<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?723452-Storium-Centurions-of-the-Galactic-Core" rel="nofollow">Here's a thread at RPG.net</a> where I talk about running the game and how I've figured things out about the system.<br/><br/>Also, anyone currently in the Beta for Storium can invite anyone to a game (and thus the Beta) with just their email address.

So "they're going to charge you to use it" isn't fair.  "They're going to charge you to use it after you've had multiple chances to try it out and decided you like it, as expressed by continued patronage" might be a fair statement, but... yeah, that's commerce.  It's not evil.  It's just a good faith request to help pay the bills for a service you're using.<br/><br/>Lord knows they could be evil about it.

But these are things that can be fixed.  It does have genuine value-add to the platform.  I can't speak for the GM side of things but there's a cubic ton of games already being ran on the site so it can't be that problematic to work with.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431859/#Comment_431859" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T20:58:52+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  8:58PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>that's commerce.

These days I look at free services (other than labors of love like this site) as more potentially-sleazy. If they're not going to be up-front about charging money to keep the light on, then usually the next shoe that drops is that they start selling our eyeballs to advertisers, or they sell themselves to a big company like Facebook or Google that, nine times out of ten, shuts the service down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431860/#Comment_431860" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T21:05:07+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  9:05PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A Software Truism: If the product is free, <i>you</i> are the product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431862/#Comment_431862" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T21:17:59+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  9:17PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not claiming they're evil.

Up front or after a few games, it's still paying to upload pics to your free form game.\n<blockquote>the fact that it has a lightweight system, and a straightforward flow of play in its UI, makes it attractive to people who aren't already comfortable with roleplaying games. I think that's a big deal for people who want to see story-games reach a wider audience, or who have non-gamers they'd like to play with online.</blockquote>\nThis is kind of backwards, I think. What's more lightweight than free form? Nothing. What's more straightforward than one-on-one roleplaying with someone who's already into the hobby? Not much. So where are all the new people to the hobby that should be coming in? Free form doesn't cost, and you don't have to throw money into a Kickstarter to try it. So it should do exactly what you're claiming Storium will do, only better. But let's go with it anyway. Who's talking about Storium? Gamers. How are non-gamers going to hear about Storium? From gamers. How is that markedly different than any other game? It's not. So again, nothing unique here. If you honestly think this is somehow a magic bullet that will suddenly draw more people to gaming, I'm not sure what is causing you to think that. Nothing I've seen suggests such a thing.<br/><br/>A few writers who also happen to be gamers are contributing worlds to the system, but you have dozens of recent writers (especially in fantasy) who aren't shy about gaming or actively promote gaming. They will draw more people into the hobby than some new shiny that's only on the radar of people already in the hobby or those already talking about gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431863/#Comment_431863" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T21:25:37+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  9:25PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My big concern (and I know I'm pretty much a Storium booster now) is that I still haven't convinced myself it's worth $25 a year.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know I pay $15 a month for WoW and I rarely run instances or PVP any more, but even so, that $2 for Storium each month is still a hard sell.<br/><br/>I like it a lot for what it is.

Mechanics that are managed by the site, as well. Mechanically, it's rather spiffy. There's a few different nuts and bolts that work in tension with one another so that you get the advantage of a game that steers the narrative and encourages a degree of strategic thought.<br/><br/><b>For instance...</b><br/><br/>Resolving a subplot (by making moves which play Subplot cards) gives you a little boost: a wild Strength. It's like a simpler version of Marvel Heroic's Milestones/TSoY's Keys. It's a short power burst that won't stick around <br/><br/>Burning through your Strengths and Weaknesses lets you slowly redefine your character, because you pick three Strengths/Weaknesses from your most recently-played Strengths/Weaknesses (as appropriate). Resolve subplots, and that lets you redefine your character faster, by writing in another wild Strength.<br/><br/>Subplots and Assets let you pad a challenge, conserving your Strengths to win a challenge, or letting you dilute your Weaknesses. (For instance, let's say a challenge has 4 slots. That could be one Strength and three Assets/Subplot cards, or two Strengths, an Asset/Subplot, and a Weakness. Either way, you win. If you were only playing Strengths and Weaknesses, you'd have to play three Strengths to win that Challenge.)<br/><br/>It's narratively tactical. Which is really cool. And the mechanics are elegant. They lead to some interesting emergent behavior. You've got all sorts of levers to monkey around with, and the whole thing is an incredibly-accessible story-based RPG. Which integrates with a smooth online platform. It's "plug-and-play".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431903/#Comment_431903" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T15:45:34+00:00" title="April 30, 2014  3:45PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also got a nice method of character building (and world building) which lets the narrator define what kind of things she expects to see in the game while still allowing the players to customize their characters as they wish.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerulean" title="nerulean"><img alt="nerulean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerulean">nerulean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431921/#Comment_431921" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T03:23:28+00:00" title="May  1, 2014  3:23AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm so torn on Storium. I really want to like it, but I keep coming back to the thought that I would probably get more out of most of what I'm doing with it if I were playing on a completely freeform message board with an agreed etiquette about conflict resolution. A lot of the system elements seem off to me, possibly because they don't gel with how things have been done in my online communities before, which I accept is a very personal reason not to get along with the game, but I keep trying to articulate this so I'm going to have another go.<br/><br/>One example of what bothers me is the ability to win narrative control. I created my character both mechanically and fictionally, and I control it up until someone else plays the last card on a challenge, at which point they control everything and the narrator is the only one with a veto built into the system. Obviously if someone does something that I really object to then I can raise it in the chat, but once someone has put the effort into committing a section of story to writing and other players have read it, it feels considerably more difficult to ask them to change than it would if they'd made a quick comment you disagreed with in a face-to-face game. <br/><br/>At low levels this can mean accepting additions to your character's story that you'd prefer not to use because it's too much hassle or delay to change it, but I could also see it causing someone to keep quiet about something that made them feel genuinely uncomfortable. I feel like a game where loss of control is built into the system should have some sort of up-front expectation-setting built in as well, especially where the format is intended as a generic toolkit rather than a gaming experience targeted specifically at exploring ideas of control, where a certain level of consent would be implicit from the buy-in.<br/><br/>A side effect of the winning control mechanic is that I've got to the point more than once where I've felt like I'm barely roleplaying, I'm just writing sequential sections of a story. That's a fine way of doing things, but again it's not implicit to me from the act of creating characters and giving them key ways of interacting with the world and each other. I find myself playing a lot of neutral cards in order to get a response from someone else, even though there's a fair chance that will end badly for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431926/#Comment_431926" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T07:28:42+00:00" title="May  1, 2014  7:28AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2014 7:29AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's certainly a potential flaw; I think that the "harder" the system gets played, the more potential there is for things to get cagey.

The place where I see the issues coming in is with people who usually play exclusively face-to-face, as they're used to pushing other players pretty hard with their contributions since they can get immediate feedback from their table in the form of a simple nod that doesn't break the flow of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431933/#Comment_431933" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T12:08:16+00:00" title="May  1, 2014 12:08PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2014 12:08PM by Jonas Ferry.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That's exactly the culture of online play I'm used to.

If you order a drink in a scene and the other person on stage says "Oh, I thought you were recovering", now you're a recovering alcoholic. You accept this and don't block it, in fact you gladly accept it, because it's much easier to play a scene with someone who creates content than someone who waffles ("What kind of drinks do you like?", "Sour drinks, and you?", "I like sweet drinks.", "Uhu.").<br/><br/>In tabletop RPGs I've always encountered a much stronger sense of ownership from players over their character. Unless the system explicitly gives another player or the GM the right to give the character the "alcoholic" trait, the player probably won't accept it from someone else. People are totally blocking all the time in tabletop RPGs ("my character would never do that!"). I tried to talk to one of my groups about this, but they were really reluctant to let anyone else, even (or especially?) the GM, add things to their character without prior out-of-character consent. On the other hand, I agree that a lot of tabletop RPGs let you push quite hard in conflicts against other players, perhaps because the player are right there and can express immediately if a line is crossed.<br/><br/>In Storium, you could let players select how much they want others to influence their character at character creation. Perhaps there's a "character ownership" card that can say things like "My character is mine, don't add anything that I haven't established or approved" or "Include my character in your moves, but keep it friendly" or "Create my character together with me, transform it with your moves". In my current game I want to be included in other players' moves, I think it's great, but I'm hesitant to add others to mine, because  don't know if they'll like it. Perhaps there should be a built-in way of coming to an understanding apart from the comments?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431936/#Comment_431936" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T12:26:31+00:00" title="May  1, 2014 12:26PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Inter-player actions and understandings are something that's kinda missing from Storium right now - I like the idea of cards, it fits into the structure they've got going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431937/#Comment_431937" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T12:35:01+00:00" title="May  1, 2014 12:35PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, currently, the best way we have to handle those situations is to discuss it in the OOC sidebar.

It sounds like Storium faces all the same challenges as freeform online roleplay, including the sense that you're simply taking turns writing a story (not necessarily a bad thing, of course - in fact, that may be the design goal here, no?) and the issues around character ownership.<br/><br/>Back when I actually did some freeform roleplay (in chatrooms - this was a long time ago!) I remember there being a very clear unwritten rule, which was that your ability to narrate more or less ended where someone else's began. If someone attacked you with a sword, it was up to you to narrate how it affected your character. It was up to you to be gracious (someone who always came out of every situation ahead and well would be considered a boring player), but the choice to, say, have your arm chopped off would always be in your hands.<br/><br/>From a roleplaying perspective, I find this approach tends to diminish drama - people are more careful and more hesitant, resist change, and all the bad things which happen to you are fundamentally things you've chosen. So it feels very different from a lot of "face-to-face" kind of roleplay.<br/><br/>(Although I'd say that something like Fiasco struggles with all the same issues, and in a pretty similar way. Except that the premise of the game and things like the Tilt and Aftermath, as well as the die colours, help the players negotiate a little harder and prepare you for the worst before you even start playing. Playing Fiasco with the assumption that the characters were heroes who would triumph over adversity could potentially be quite a horrible game, I think...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432008/#Comment_432008" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-02T19:32:05+00:00" title="May  2, 2014  7:32PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2014 7:32PM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the (very few) things PBF does better than TT is the creation of a literary artifact which can be read afterward by people who were not players in the game.

The challenge gave me a hint about what sort of success this was, but there was no guidance or advice on involving the other player's contribution, despite their's being 3/4 of the work! My narration was also published instantly, leaving little room for negotiation of the outcome other than via exchanging messages through the commentary sidebar.<br/><br/>I'm still waiting to be convinced that the Narrator occupies a unique role within the game: it seems like the form would be better suited to a GM-less game (though the Narrator isn't anything like a GM) where all the players have equal authority in the plot and no-one has any privileged information about the world. As it is, the Narrator seems more like a budget controller, deciding where &amp; when to spend the capital of the fiction within the limits imposed by the system: given that, it seems like it would be a very small tweak to tie this Challenge budgeting into the cards played by the other players and do without the Narrator's role altogether.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432994/#Comment_432994" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-25T08:16:20+00:00" title="May 25, 2014  8:16AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's some astute thoughts.
