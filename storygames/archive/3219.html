When having a scene that does not work out right, the response is no longer "hmm. I should play it out differently next time" but instead "Wonder if I can make rules to help me out here?".<br/><br/>The scene in question was a refresh scene where a character goes ring-fighting after an insult. And gets promptly beaten up. Now what? If I was a good gm there would be consequences which the player or I could visit later. What I got from that is just one NPC and some harm on the player, which seems a bit flat.<br/><br/>Also, I've noticed another peculiarity of tsoy: bonus/penalty dice are distributed unevenly. It is not surprising to have some 5+ bonus dice at one go, but cases where you have 2 penalty dice seems rather rare. I think that there is room for bit more.<br/><br/>What I thought might be nice is "harm cards". Do away with the harm track and replace with harm cards. These are names for the bad stuff that happen to you and a mechanical effect which can be invoked by any player or gm. There are basically two kinds: ones that give you either bonus or penalty die, depending on the situation and the ones that give you penalty die and if you invoke them yourself you get 1 XP. There is a buyoff condition like the keys. You don't get xp but you get rid of the harm. Or you can keep it and invoke it for xp or compassion dice as long as you like.<br/><br/>Design idea is to provide tool for inspiration and including pains and hurts in the narration. They each cover a smaller area with penalty dice, so you can have several without getting totally unusable character.<br/><br/>(Invoking = including in the narration and tagging for mechanical effect.)<br/><br/>They are a freeform tool in sense that some are worse than others and it is totally left to players and gm to decide what are included in stakes. You can even select a few and then have the player pull out predefined number of them. <br/><br/>You drop out of btdps if you get five. You can include them in btpb stakes when changing goals.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.cc.jyu.fi/~aleator/harmcards.png"/><br/><br/>As an afterthought, I added death card as well as death of companion. I'm doubtful of these, though they have certain oomph! in them.<br/>If you'd ever do cthulhu tsoy (why!) you could probably steal various insanities as well.. Though.. Insanities would be very cool for my Conan campaign with necromancers.. hmm.<br/><br/>What do you think? Got more ideas for hurts and pains? I would need a bunch, especially social ones.  (If you do I might make a printable cards out of them for everyones pleasure.. Naturally with better quality text than these proof of concept ones. )                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73643/#Comment_73643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T14:25:44+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  2:25PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is inspiring thoughts which may well end up in the Pentasystem, where you get "downtwists" and "uptwists" as consequences of conflict.

If you're giving them away for a different cost, then you'll need to make sure the cost is the equivalent of an Advance (if that's possible). Because if I can get Keys for 'free', then I'll try to get them more often than regular Keys, especially if I decide when to buy them off.<br/><br/>Maybe force them to be fragile - A mini-Key can only give out a total of 3 XP?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73994/#Comment_73994" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T11:44:33+00:00" title="June  6, 2007 11:44AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't have them grant XP.

First is formula to generate these, which atleast I am not qualified to make. Even if you'd give a price, the 'balance' would entirely depend on how the play advances. It is the same with current harm tracks as well. Sometimes having it hurts and other times not so much.<br/><br/>Second is the XP bonus. Harm does not cost you a thing (*) and you can be forced to take some. I really don't want these to be things you like to collect but something you perhaps flaunt for few scenes and then try to get rid of. Ie. A real disadvantage but with a little something to encourage you to show it up. Would you really start collecting these while playing?<br/><br/>(*) Actually getting a wound costs you the time in play to get in a fight.<br/><br/><br/>And to summarize what I've got so far:<br/>* 1 XP (max 3 per wound? per session?) for incorporating the wound into narration<br/>* Each wound can be tagged by the opponent/other players for a penalty, whenever.<br/>* Five of these is way too much! Either print out empty cards that count towards limit if pulling these from a deck, or give them out when you progress in harm tracks<br/>* They seem like good stakes for non-bdtb tests.<br/>* The buyoff seems to be the interest point of these: How do I get rid of this wound? (No, you don't get anything extra for buying it off)<br/>* No playtesting yet, since I want to get feel for tsoys wound mechanism before altering it.<br/>* Require a physical card to work.<br/><br/>Can't really see how they work as refreshes.. But that gave me an idea: Require refreshes to<br/>get rid of these. Ie. Going to the doc who sews you up is a refresh (Do I make things too easy for the players? Will every refresh scene be one with a doctor?)<br/><br/>I've got the following planned, but I'm still uncertain about pricing.

If these were the only way to gain XP you'd get probably some kind of victim horror. Players would gather these to get XP to<br/>overcome stuff while trying to balance them against wish for functional character.. Though I think original type of Keys would be better. Just colour them black.. (I think I would prefer nemesis style madness meters for this though)<br/><br/>Or in lighter side, you could have something like in ditvs fallout based advancements which is not that dark but Interesting idea though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
