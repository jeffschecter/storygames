<div class="Message">
                    I'm assembling my next RPGnet article, which is looking back to some early articles I wrote on desk-checking RPGs and simulating players. I'm planning to focus this new article on specific theories of players or groups of players - as tools for building simulated players. These tend to be much less common than theories of play - which focus on what happens in play, rather than player motivations. So far I have three:
<ul>
<li>Forgian Creative Agendas - specifically as gestalt aesthetics of a group of players.</li>
<li>Mo's Sockets, Goals, and Payoffs </li>
<li>My Dynamic Views</li>
</ul>
I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for others. I've been tracking a fair bit of theory development, but I'm a little sparse on Nordic-larp approaches. Let me know if I'm missing something here, I'd rather be able to add it to the article, than to find out about it afterwards.<br/><br/>Thanks for your help,<br/><br/>    - Mendel S.                </div>

Mendel,<br/><br/>But the taxonomy are based on theories of what motivates players in a group or as individuals. The classifications seem more like shorthand for what you are looking for but still directly related. Your short summary of views is that they are parts of what is going in during play to which players pay attention. Taking a look at <i>Robin's Laws of Good Game Mastering</i>, he's done the same thing except added a label to an overall groupings of related player motivations. If you examine any individual grouping, they are composed of the elements that I believe you are looking for. <br/><br/>Am I misunderstanding?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>John                        </div>

                            John,<br/><br/>Some, perhaps even many, of the available taxonomies are based on theories of player motivation, but very, very few of these bases are ever presented. I've not read Robin's Laws, but it would only serve this purpose if it contains an explicit theory of how, say, a power gamer would response to a game situation. Of course you can intuit a naive theory of player motivations from such a category, but you're forced to do all of the lifting. <br/><br/>Most RPG theories don't make motivations explicit, largely because on the face it seems obnoxious. It seems to deny the freedom a player has to make their own decision - they are a powergamer so they will do X in Y situation. In actuality this is a straw man argument, a theory of motivations is always probabilistic - people can always choose a less likely decision. So a powergamer will tend to do X in Y situation, but will tend to do Z much less than another category. <br/><br/>Taxonomies imply these things all the time, but stop short of actually giving you tools to directly predict motivations. This is a major problem with using those models for game design, rather than in direct play. You can be intuitive with a single player, but with a nebulous space of players who may play your game, our built-in intuition of people becomes unreliable. <br/><br/>The other problem is that a taxonomy is more resilient to criticism without an explicit model of player motives. In a sense it doesn't make predictions, apply in large scale (design versus play) situations, or delve into fundamentals of why we play. It is a shallow theory, and the arguments usually end up with - you can categorize my way or your way. If you have actual motives, then your theory can be evaluated on several grounds: self-consistency (your motive theory must imply your taxonomy) and empirical observations (your motive theory predicts actual play decisions). <br/><br/>To focus things a bit more, the theory of views I've presented explicitly says that players make their decisions to keep the content within their views of intermediate complexity - and those terms are well enough defined that you could test the claim that any player is acting within a specific view. If I present a taxonomy of views - which I have in the past - then they become something that can directly be turned into predictions of players. <br/><br/>So perhaps I should have said that I'm looking for theories that directly predict player decisions. <br/><br/><br/>P.S.: I'm sorry if I'm being ranty. I'm having a rough week (or perhaps month)...<br/><br/>  - Mendel S.                        </div>

                            First of all hi everyone, this is my first post on these forums.<br/>
<br/>
Mendel,<br/>
<br/>
It might be not right for me to post this in this thread, because I don't answer your question, but it is just about your PCon3 theory and GNS. (I think, the latter you call Forgian Creative Agendas, please tell me if I'm mistaken.)<br/>
<br/>
In the last months I was reading and translating into Hungarian some articles and essays about RPG theory, and I found the most intriguing your RPGnet column, because I think it is more practical than Ron Edwards' model.<br/>
<br/>
But as I looked back at your PCon3 and Ron's GNS modes and Stances, I realized that the latter is just describing the Control-functions of the former. (I always looked at the Controls as functions, as in M=f(G) where G is the content of the game, M is the added or dubstracted content by the player, and f is the Control.) For example I look at the Simulationist mode where the priority is the exploration of character. That means that the view of that player is focused (not exclusively, but mainly) on the game contents regarding his/her character and that player wants to have intermadiet complexity of patterns involving his/her character. How that particular player modifies the content of the game is described by the Stances. I was planning for some time to write an essay about this possibility, but it seems your next article will cover it far better.<br/>
<br/>
And one other thing, I think I have to explain why I would use exclusively GNS for this matter: I have the idea (I can explain it if you like in this or another thread) that the three modes G, N and S cover the full spectrum of players and there is no possible fourth mode, wich cannot be said for other models.<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me if I'm on the right or wrong track.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                            Sorry for the delay, I've had an excessively busy week. Of note, I've put an early <a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">draft</a> of the article (it'll be on RPGnet on Friday)<br/><br/>Brand,<br/><br/>Thanks, I've been keeping track of your blogs, and I had seen that. I'm not too familiar with prediction from  Meyers-Briggs. <br/><br/><br/>Gabor,<br/><br/>The function idea is right on. Controls are the strategies / heuristics we use to take the content we see and turn that back to our influence on the content. On the other hand, stances are a bit limited. Critically, PCon3 doesn't distinguish "imagined" and "real" content, because there really isn't a bright line distinction. Stance really only makes sense  around the context of the small chunk of imagined content which comprises the character. The thing I'm very interested in is how the views change, and that was always something which creeps into the controls. Specifically, you can produce fun either by contributing or changing the content, or my moving your view to a better part of the content. <br/><br/>This is especially telling in a larp context: I can bring up another topic of conversation to restart interaction here, or I can walk to the next room to find someone else to talk to. Some of that is "imagined" some of that is "real", but it's all play content and play controls. (On a side note, that makes play constraints a superset of lumpley system - its not just about the imagined content, it's about the entire space of content.)<br/><br/>I'll also be following up on your other thread, although I haven't had a chance to read and think about it sufficiently at the moment.<br/><br/>   - Mendel<br/><br/>(edited to correct an terminology error - play constraints are supersets of lumpley system, play controls drive the dynamics of play - which give rise to the play constraints.)                        </div>

                            Mendel,<br/><br/>Thanks, but to say the truth, I'm a bit frustrated, because since I've read the word "ur-game" in your column, I was thinking about how would it be possible to make a real ur-game work. I know it isn't easy to explain or even realize this thing, but is or was there already a working ur-game that you (or someone else) used to test an RPG? Sorry if it is evident, but I can't decide wether this is "only" a theory or is it practice already. For example right now reading your column and your PCon3 posts at the Forge I can't make a functioning ur-game â€“ certainly it is possible that it is entirely my fault. I just wouldn't like to miss anything.<br/><br/>Reading your draft of the article I was thinking about how could anyone define or at least suspect what can a view be at a specific game, not to speak about the change and the dynamics of it. I know, your goal is to incorporate everything from larps to mushes (if I'm not mistaken), but I'm always thinking about table-top RPGs.<br/><br/>What does define a players view if not the "layout" of objects? The most mundane example: the front page of a character sheet is mostly full of attributes and skills, and the backstory and properties are mostly on the backside of the character sheet. (This is just an example for the classic FRPGs I know.) What does that mean? You always see your strength attribute, but you have to turn the page for the money, and have to read long texts for other properties (house, horses etc.). My experience tells me that against every effort to "immerse into the character and backstory etc." the attributes are the most important in play. It is even funny, because the attributes and skills aren't enough to auqire a big house or to win a fight against a warhorse that awaits the PC at home.<br/><br/>Surely this is only the most simple example, the next would be why a player's character is closer to the player's view than the other characters. Because it is a tool for the player to manipulate the content of play. And so on. I think based upon this someone could build a tipology for the views to roam around. I hope this isn't too farfetched.<br/><br/>Gabor                        </div>

                            Gabor,<br/><br/>Sorry again for the delay. It's difficult to show an example of an ur-game without the game to be analyzed present at first. I know I didn't get into it before, but there are basically two types of ur-games, both of which reduce the complexity of one game by replacing the players with another game. On one hand, you can do that by replacing players with a mathematical game, so you can start finding optimal strategies on the design side. A short example of that was in the original <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/physics26mar03.html" rel="nofollow">article</a>. <br/><br/>The alternative is to reduce things to a "roleplaying" problem, setting up immersive or philosophic structures upon the game so as to analyze the game from there. Of course, setting up a context where you can immerse as a Story Now player or Mo's Impassioned Other is requisite on an ability to immerse well and accurately. These types of ur-games are extremely interesting, as they exist to transform one aspect of RPG play to another. But this can make them highly personal, both to the game and the desk checker.<br/><br/>I've used both approaches, and I find the later type of ur-game useful. Unfortunately, I've not yet been able to put together a procedure that ecapsulates the process of making one. Both rely on theory to drive them, so you can tie motivations and goals of one approach to another. <br/><br/>As far as defining a specific view, the best description of that happened over at the Forge in my aborted series of posts (aborted because the RPG Theory forum was closed in the middle of them). <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17615.0" rel="nofollow">Here</a> in particular, with <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17387.0" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17514.0" rel="nofollow">here</a> preceding. Physical views are certainly important, but there's more too it than that. Different players will look at a character sheet and see different things. Some may see those ability scores, another the picture of the character in the corner. When I DM D&amp;D and glance over the table at character sheets, I usually see the saves and hitpoints most prominently. <br/><br/>But views are a little more than what I see, they are also how I see it changing - which is were the activity, descriptions and general banter can become many different views. Generally static views are of dynamic things, because if their subject is static, things are intensely unsatisfying. But a dynamic view could be of a static subject, much like a person looking at a painting, seeing different parts and perspectives over time. <br/><br/>I hope that is of some help,<br/><br/>  - Mendel S.                        </div>
