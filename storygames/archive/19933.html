We\u2019ve talked about initative here on Story Games and one of the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/438939/#Comment_438939" rel="nofollow">options that came up</a> was a Sorcerer-style \u201cFree and Clear\u201d-phase.<br/>2. I pretty much stopped hanging around here after the X-card discussion. And stopped hanging around much of the larger RPG web in general. It\u2019s not just what happened here, it\u2019s also all the divisive issues and also how so many groups here in my town are going for themes and tropes in gaming that I\u2019m just sick of.<br/>3. I\u2019ve been DM:ing a lot, though. I don\u2019t feel like I belong in the hobby at large but that\u2019s not going to stop me from hitting the table with my own group, which I do like a lot. We finished LMoP and we were just about to start Al-Qadim when I got hit by a cold and was away from D&amp;D for three weeks or so.</small><br/><br/>So someone else in my group, Alex, wanted to try DMing a one-shot session. I had been looking forward to it with trepidation since he loves my least favorite edition (third) and I\u2019m more into sandboxy OSR games. But we were playing 5e and as I was making my character I thought \u201cThis is going to be awesome\u201d and it was.<br/><br/>The session was great, we all had cool characters, the DM was attentive and there was a lot of exploration, interaction and a few big fights. We cut rules discussions short.<br/><br/>We were playing in Greyhawk, in a small town near the wilderness, hired to be bodyguards for a somewhat evil countess and fighting somewhat evil assassins. It was pretty much set up to be morally ambiguous on both ends and we were offered to join them instead of sticking with her. We tried to negotiatate but all parties were very stubborn \u2014 here the DM came across as being a bit too married to the predetermined timeline rather than to the setup viewed as a dynamic situation, which is always a peeve of mine, but nothing that ruined the evening.<br/><br/>I mean, it could\u2019ve been better. There was a lot of times where we would go and do things that would end up being nothing. The \u201cexploration\u201d ended up feeling pretty empty, it was all spun around this core of this assassin trio vs this countess and we couldn\u2019t really do much to resolve the situation except choose sides; a lot of our attempts to delay or defuse the situation were shot down.<br/><br/>The opposition were fully statted out characters made as if they were PCs, but it worked fine to fight against them. We were level 5 and so were they, we defeated them pretty easily. My friends were a cleric and a warlock using command, hold person, and suggest to lock them down, and I was a low-AC/high-damage fighter to take them down quickly. This part is hard to review because I don\u2019t know to what extent the DM \u201cwent easy on us\u201d or not. But our characters were barely scratched. The fight was interesting logistically with a few multiple fronts we had to defend at the same time.<br/><br/>The DM said: \u201cI want to try something\u201d and we were just about to get into a long discussion about it but I said \u201cJust try it and we can discuss afterwards\u201d. What it ended up being was the reason for this post: a Free and Clear phase, implemented like this:<br/><br/>1. Initiative was rolled in the beginning of combat.<br/>2. In the beginning of each round, everyone says briefly what they want to do.<br/>3. Then everyone goes in initiative order and resolve what happens as per normal 5e.<br/><br/>Since the 5e system is very task-resolution oriented as opposed to conflict-resolution oriented, it was a bit different or weird. It\u2019s still Fortune At the End, it\u2019s not like there was some real point to, or use of, everyone pre-stating their actions.<br/><br/>Like, a F&amp;C phase can have a purpose in a set up like this:<br/><br/>1. In the beginning of each round, everyone says briefly what they want to do.<br/>2. Informed by that (and by mechanics), the order and resolution of what happens is determined.<br/><br/>So I\u2019ll start with some problems of how it was implemented specifically here. We ended up abandoning it after only a few rounds because one player, the warlock \u2014 who has problems with English (my apologies if you do read this, M!) \u2014 was delaying actions and was also last in the initative round so it was confusing.<br/><br/>He was saying: \u201cI\u2019m shooting them as they pop up to fire at us\u201d in regards to some hidden bowmen.<br/>The DM and the rest of the group interpreted/implemented that as him delaying his action using \u201cthey pop up\u201d as a trigger.<br/>When the DM soon afterwards introduced us to this F&amp;C \u201cbriefly state what you want to do in the round\u201d, it seems that this warlock player didn\u2019t really understand that, and it also became apparent that he wasn\u2019t aware that he was already delaying his actions. We tried to explain in three or four different ways but in the end gave up the F&amp;C experiment after a few rounds.<br/><br/>He was trying to roll already in the F&amp;C phase for example. We tried to be clear like \u201cno, you\u2019re last in the initative round\u201d etc. I don\u2019t blame him, the setup was confusing and redundant.<br/><br/>That redundancy was a big part of the problem. We used 5e:s very task-oriented resolution system complete with delaying actions so the F&amp;C didn\u2019t really add anything of value.<br/><br/>The DM says he used to do it to great effect as a house rule with his old 3e group, but admitted that 3e:s delayed actions work differently (in 5e, they \u201cset up a trigger\u201d, in 3e, you change your initative count number) so 3e wouldn\u2019t have had that particular problem. He also blamed part of the confusion on a lack of clarity on whether or not the hidden bowmen were in cover or not, which I don\u2019t buy \u2014 either the system can handle \u201cI shoot the bowmen when they pop up from hiding to fire\u201d or it can\u2019t.<br/><br/>He also phrased it in a way that I think might be a clue to why he did this: \u201cEveryone says what they intend to do, then we resolve it in order <em>and I say what happens</em>\u201d (emphasis mine). His old group maybe wanted him to be more of a narrator than we, who are more into saying what we do ourselves. This is just a guess, though.<br/><br/>But since 5e is set up the way it is (and I\u2019d actually wager it\u2019s pretty much the same for 3e) it ended up being very redundant. Just very much \u201cwe are saying everything twice for no particular reason\u201d.<br/><br/>You can get a lot of mileage out of a F&amp;C phase, it can enable conflict-level resolution rather than task based and it can enable more detailed or seamless narration, if and only if paired with a timing system built around it, which 5e isn\u2019t.<br/><br/>So let\u2019s talk about my experience with F&amp;C discarding 5e\u2019s particular incompatibilities with it:<br/>I still hate it. It\u2019s a very \u201cindirect\u201d feeling for me that feels more like writing a story or playing with dolls than \u201cI do <em>this!</em> [rolls] BAM!\u201d. I love the \u201cdirectness\u201d of task resolution systems. Do I fight the troll? yes/no Yes!<br/><br/>Overall, I had a lot of fun. Enjoyed the characters, enjoyed the NPCs, enjoyed the setting.<br/>The F&amp;C experiment was brief.<br/>I thought there was a bit of a lack of things to actually decide about and influence and do, and more of a static timeline to gradually discover. We could join the assassins or the countess but not really influence either side.<br/>The ending was wistful but interesting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441009/#Comment_441009" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-23T10:19:21+00:00" title="December 23, 2014 10:19AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to add that I've DM:ed/GM:ed many sessions that were much worse.

I think it works fine if you're willing to get rid of the initiative order. The old and popular group initiative order "PCs go first, then monsters" is basically this already, it just goes one side at a time to reduce the antagonistic bickering. (If both monsters and PCs go at once, the GM absolutely needs to have the grit to execute those actions all at once, rather than letting players spiral into initiative thinking. The only way in a F&amp;C system to beat somebody to the punch is to pair the actions and determine their mutual precedence from the degree of success. Most of the time it is entirely satisfactory to have everybody roll their attacks and if they kill each other with simultaneous strikes, that's their look-out.)<br/><br/>As you say, coupling F&amp;C with traditional initiative is redundant. There's a slight advantage in getting to coordinate plans before carrying them out, but this doesn't really make the game faster, more realistic or challenging, so it's not very relevant at all. I concur with the judgement that you need to either go all the way into F&amp;C, or not bother with it at all.<br/><br/>I suppose that the big strategic question for integrating F&amp;C into D&amp;D is whether Dexterity bonuses (and feats etc. that give initiative bonuses) should be taken into consideration in some manner in the integration. After all, the "slow" characters in the initiative sense get a vague sort of advantage if they now get to act at the same time with the "quick" ones. For me personally this is almost no loss at all, as I'm not that convinced about initiative as a model of "quickness" in the first place - it's just pretty toothless, and there are more interesting ways to represent the idea that a character is quick and smart.<br/><br/>I should clarify that Free and Clear is a task resolution scheme, though - all the big implementations (<i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>Trollbabe</i> and <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> come to mind foremost) use it in a task resolution context. I guess that one could think of traditional conflict resolution as F&amp;C as well in the sense that players declare intentions before resolving them, but that's more of a technicality to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441023/#Comment_441023" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-24T04:41:24+00:00" title="December 24, 2014  4:41AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the other issue with modern iterations of D&amp;D is movement.

I didn't think of that at all, but were I running it, I'd give it to the retreating party on realism grounds - that's one of the less sensible outcomes in miniatures chess D&amp;D in any case, the way movement in space somehow does not reflect at all on initiative order. You'd expect the character who has to move their full movement allowance before executing their action to lose initiative on the way to somebody who can act immediately where they stand. (Which is in fact exactly how I execute this, when I play 3rd-edition style initiative in my homebrew - your charge starts in one initiative segment, while the actual attack lands later, possibly with some other activities in between.)<br/><br/>I guess that 3rd edition (more familiar to me than 5th) with Free and Clear would have it that movement occurs simultaneously (and is in fact figured out with the figs during the Free and Clear - simple, really, as long as the parties are clear on their intents), anybody can respond to anybody else's action (so there's no preparing to pre-empt others), and opportunity attacks get largely reworked to account for the weird movement system. With Free and Clear it'd make perfect sense to declare active blocking intent, after all, such as "I'll prevent them from getting past me into the hallway"; in orthodox 3rd edition that'd be "I stand here and hit anybody who decides to run past as an opportunity attack", but a F&amp;C system would have to decide how it'd handle stuff like this. Could be as simple as deciding that anybody gets an opportunity attack on any opponent who moves in their vicinity without directly engaging them, I suppose, but that seems like a lost opportunity at first sight - if you're enabling simultaneous movement, I don't see any reason why "getting past someone" couldn't and shouldn't be a bull rush type maneuver of some sort. Completely removing opportunity attacks would be a pretty big technical revision, though, with complex after-effects for anybody trying to play robust rules-based miniatures chess <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>But yeah, you're right on the practical issue - a change like that does require entirely rethinking the miniatures chess aspects of the game. That whole move/ready/initiative triangle is such a fundamental aspect of 3rd-5th edition of the game. Probably not worth it in practice, I don't really see Free and Clear as a huge advantage for these editions in any case.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441025/#Comment_441025" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-24T07:20:11+00:00" title="December 24, 2014  7:20AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One rarely-used rule from 3rd Ed that's actually quite good, and I think would work well in 5th: if you're not happy with your initiative, you can re-roll it at the start of the next round. I'd be pretty strict, I think, in making everyone *declare* whether or not they were going to re-roll initiative before any dice hit the table. No, "Oh shit, the gnoll is going before me now!? Guess I'd better re-roll then, too." Of course, I'd be inclined to be transparent about monster Init bonuses, and keep same-type monsters in groups.<br/><br/>I think this approach actually gives some of the same benefits as a true F&amp;C, without breaking the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441026/#Comment_441026" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-24T08:16:01+00:00" title="December 24, 2014  8:16AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to mention it in this thread, but I'm going to go with the "fixed" initiative from the dmg.
