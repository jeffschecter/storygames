Instead of messing around with some other personal stuff last night, I decided to try and create a Fiasco playset for the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt definitely needs a custom Tilt and Aftermath, and probably some of the locations don't work very well, as it seems to scream that the entire game should take place in the North Pole Village, as little side trips to the outside world will probably be broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther concerns simply would be that as I went along collecting elements from the R/B specials, and running out of interesting ideas from them, my dark side took over. So while there exists a possibly of a sweet Christmas story in here (maybe), I can see the stories ending with vengeful elves throwing Santa into the blades of a giant snow blower. So, yes, this could destroy your precious childhood memories.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully I'll get a chance to playtest it eventually...my opportunities are too few at this time of year. Forgive any typos, it kept me up very late last night....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRELATIONSHIPS\t\t<br/>\n1\tFAMILY\t<br/>\n\t1\tunrealted, but close as blood<br/>\n\t2\tfriendly
