Are there any AP reports out there that I'm missing?<br/><br/>My fiance and I went through the book the other night, but it was late and she was too tired to start actually doing scenes. I think part of it was that we weren't quite sure what to do*, and that she's new to RPing and finds the freedom and creativity required intimidating rather than exciting (though she's a really creative person--but now I'm talking about a different issue). I'm floundering a little bit with the lack of structure, and I think an example of play would really help.<br/><br/><br/>*The rule for setting a goal for the scene is a helpful suggestion, but I'm not sure what a good goal is. "Find the house with the antenna from the picture"--Is that a goal that will work in play?<br/><br/>Overthinking?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235535/#Comment_235535" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-04T13:54:10+00:00" title="October  4, 2009  1:54PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hey Hans,<br/><br/>If you want to check out some AP go <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27048.0" rel="nofollow">here (forge article)</a>. Ron had some good play and wrote a lovely summation.<br/><br/>Yeah, don't over think it. And don't try to story game the hell out of it. It's not a roleplaying game, its a casual kind of story telling thing. <br/><br/>Your listed goal is totally cool. will work fine.<br/><br/>Check out the very center spread in the journal if you want more guidance about setting up scenes. There's a hint hidden in there.<br/><br/>Hope you have a great time with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bevedog" title="bevedog"><img alt="bevedog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stevelawson.name/icons/steve-in-3D-32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bevedog">bevedog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235563/#Comment_235563" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-04T20:16:44+00:00" title="October  4, 2009  8:16PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was wondering about this, because I think with all the cutting of the book, I may have some performance anxiety.

BTW, girl &amp; I played 2 scenes (she can't go for hours, at least for now) this evening and had a blast. Left our anxiety behind, winged it, and things hummed.<br/><br/>We'll probably finish over a few more sit-downs.
