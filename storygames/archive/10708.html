This control might amount to doing everything themselves, even the art and layout. Sometimes they originate the text, and get third parties to do the rest. Now, in some cases, I'm sure that the publishers enjoy every aspect of this process (Fred!), but I suspect in others, the desire for control of the project means that COP publishers end up doing a bunch of stuff that they don't like, and perhaps are not even good at.<br/><br/>To what extent do publishers enjoy the whole package and to what extent do you do it just to control the final output, or maximize revenue?<br/><br/>If another publisher or organisation took your print-ready manuscript and you had a final say over print quality, then printed and distrbuted it, taking a cut, (a la Mongoose) would you be concerned you were losing control, or just annoyed you weren't making as much as if you were doing it yourself?

If something was super broken, the person or people who discovered it would take their finding to the original author first, who would then change it or not depending on their sensitivity to critique. I imagine that the playtesters could also take it to the developer, who may or may not then demand that the original author change it, but I don't think that happened much.<br/><br/>I enjoy art and layout, but if a publisher or organization wanted to do that crap for me, I wouldn't be mad at 'em. Same with sales and marketing. I'd probably do the thing that, again, freelancers like to do for Exalted and be extremely involved in the fan community to answer feedback and give clarification. I'd like to be kept in the loop about what the general feedback was from playtesting and <i>also</i> be able to do some myself for fun, but really, that's it.<br/><br/>Before I ever even knew about indie games, I was giving away material I wrote, uncredited, to Exalted freelancers in the hopes that eventually one of them would put in a good word for me and I could make too little money for too large a wordcount as well. I'm not shy about delegating to people more prepared to do things than I am, or giving up control in exchange for increased revenue or visibility. I mean, most of my money comes from selling stock photography for people to do whatever the hell they want to with it. My "artiste" sensitivities are mostly long gone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237637/#Comment_237637" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T05:37:50+00:00" title="October 15, 2009  5:37AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent question Simon.<br/><br/>For me my primary interest and effort is in the Writing and Playtesting side of things.  Secondarily I'm intensely interested in marketing and sales but lack the time to put the effort in.  Translation...In the grand scheme of prioritizing what I am doing with the time I have available, I find a way to make time for Writing and Playtesting but the Marketing and Sales tend to get bumped by other things.  They're not at the bottom of the list in the sense of "I hate that"...so if I had more available time they'd clear the hurdle, but with the limited time I have other things clear the hurdle first.<br/><br/>Of course this has as much to do with opportunity cost of other things as it does level of interest in these things.  Taken as a whole, their is a limit to the total amount of time that can be dedicated to this hobby...including the 6 items you list as well as things like play, internet forums, searching for and reading new games, attending conventions, prep, etc.  All of those things have to fit in the box labeled "Roleplaying Hobby time".  Which itself has to fit in the box labeled "gamer" with computer and console games and board games.  Which itself has to fit in the box labeled "Entertainment" alongside movies, reading, hanging out, and other assorted recreational activities.  And THAT box has to leave room for all of the rest of life's activities including maintaining relationships with loved ones beyond where they overlap with with the above boxes.<br/><br/>Currently, this hobby occupies a fairly disprotionate amount of my time such that if I suddenly found myself with an extra 5-10 hours a week, it would probably go into expanding the size of the other non Gamer related boxes first, meaning there still wouldn't be the additional time available to hit the Marketing and Sales items effectively.  <br/><br/>As for Art and Layout...my skills their are marginal (i.e. pretty close to nonexistant) so there's no real question of doing it myself.  Doing it myself would mean not only finding the time to do it, but finding the time to study and practice to get good enough to do it.  Which given my current schedule is completely out of the question.  I suspect that there's a high correlation between Indie-designers who do their own art / layout and those who have art / graphic design related jobs.<br/><br/>That said, I'm not nearly as militantly indie as some in our extended circle are.  That likely has something to do with the fact that I work with contracts (essentially) in my career alot and am thus familiar with the notion that there are few aspects of control (either financial or creative) that can't be spelled out effectively in an agreement and can't then be worked out effectively by reasonable people being reasonable.  Similarly to my graphic design comment above, I wonder if their isn't an inverse correlation between people who are most militantly independent with those whose jobs more frequently touch contract law in some fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237645/#Comment_237645" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T06:49:29+00:00" title="October 15, 2009  6:49AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>This thread makes me realize how Marxist it all is.</blockquote>\nHow Delphic!<br/><br/>I don't suppose you'd consider indulging me and answering the questions in the original post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237654/#Comment_237654" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T07:50:49+00:00" title="October 15, 2009  7:50AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph - at what point in the chain would you be happy to hand over responsibility to a third party, to save you time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237664/#Comment_237664" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T09:03:09+00:00" title="October 15, 2009  9:03AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You forgot Editing and Printing, Simon, on your list of things.

Sales is probably the largest pain, which is why having a fulfillment service like IPR -- or even, for many folks, Lulu -- was such a god-send for many of us.  The parts of Marketing that I like are getting out, meeting people, talking about games, and playing games with them.  The parts I don't like so much are market research, tailoring projects for the market rather than just doing whatever I feel like, and worrying about larger issues like which conventions I should attend (even if I don't really want to) and whether to buy advertising and the like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237677/#Comment_237677" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T09:28:58+00:00" title="October 15, 2009  9:28AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/>\n  Here are my answers:<br/>\n  To what extent do publishers enjoy the whole package and to what extent do you do it just to control the final output, or maximize revenue?

It's like the bosses of certain large companies working in the various departments to see how things are actually done. I've certainly gained even more respect for artists having tried my hand at life drawing, and more respect for writers since I've been doing a bit of that. I've learnt that unless you enjoy extensive editing, proofing and rewriting, you should never employ anything other than decent writers who want to do what you ask them to do, or you want to publish what they want to write.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238165/#Comment_238165" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T10:48:45+00:00" title="October 19, 2009 10:48AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Simon,<br/><br/>What's not on your list is the design phase.

And, having thought, at least, about a specific game design, I agree.\n<blockquote>So I'd outsource design if I thought it was possible for creative folks to produce brilliant and powerful results from my specifications; I just don't think game design greatness works that way.</blockquote>\nWell, as you might expect, I'm thoroughly agnostic on this. I don't think that COPs have a monopoly on "brilliant and powerful results" in the RPG field, or in any other. For me, Michelangelo is as great as Van Gogh, to use an overblown metaphor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
