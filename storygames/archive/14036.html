We're gaming together because were friends, not because we like the same games.<br/><br/>Some of us take turns sacrificing what we want for the group. Others jump in and out of the game depending on the specifics. Sometimes the GM tries to gives us all what we want, which can mean slowing the game down, or having long spans where people take turns being bored. In general I love people, and I'm happy to help make them awesome when the spotlight is not on me but many other people tune out when it isn't their scene.  <br/><br/>I also game with strangers (many who then become friends) and I love it! <br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because you get together based on liking the same things. <br/><br/>My wife started a Trail of Cthulhu game last night at <a href="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=20" rel="nofollow">nerdnyc's gotham gaming guild</a>. Her game is horror, acting heavy, improv heavy, player driven, historical, and probably the biggest deal breaker... requires homework! Many of our friends would not be into it. <br/><br/>But all of Terry's players LOVED it! It's exactly the kind of game they want to play. When we promoted each game at the ggg, we tried to scare people away... "this game requires homework." The people who signed up immediately bought into the game and were feeding of each other's enthusiasm right away. Players marked up all the handouts with notes and conspiracy theories, brought ipads to reference historical setting details, and one of the players even transcribed the game!!! <br/><br/>It was a magical moment for me. Sometimes I find playing RPGs a constant negotiation of different play styles. But seeing everyone click last night so fast was refreshing! It's also one of the reasons I love playing games at conventions provided the game has a strong description that cuts to the core of what the game is about... to the point it will scare away people who wouldn't enjoy it and draw closer those who would love it. <br/><br/>That all said, I love hanging out with my friends. It's just gaming very much becomes secondary. Which is ok. Things change. You evolve.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317897/#Comment_317897" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-26T22:52:31+00:00" title="March 26, 2011 10:52PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is why community development is SO important.

More of us get to play the games we want, in ways that matters to us, if we are part of a broad community of players.<br/><br/>And in addition there is something very special about playing a role-playing game with strangers; most of us will approach such a game with higher energy and a more open mind, in a "modus operandi" that makes us more susceptible to learning new things about gaming, people and ourselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318023/#Comment_318023" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-28T18:08:31+00:00" title="March 28, 2011  6:08PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>And in addition there is something very special about playing a role-playing game with strangers; most of us will approach such a game with higher energy and a more open mind, in a "modus operandi" that makes us more susceptible to learning new things about gaming, people and ourselves.</blockquote>\nThis is it for me, right here!<br/><br/>So true.
