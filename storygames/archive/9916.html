Dr. Drain had taken little Johnny Kidd captive, and tied him to his Soul Extraction Tower (timer: 3). When the Danger Patrol tried to intervene and save Johnny, Dr. Drain unleashed his dreaded Soul Snakes (they're made of human souls!).<br/><br/>Our three Patrol members were Bruce Eerie (Mystic Detective; gruff but brilliant), Professor Right (Atomic Detective; moments before venturing to Dr. Drain's home, he had just won his 25th Science Fair), and Nott (Robot Agent; Nott had two spider-like legs and a head that hung below his body mainframe).<br/><br/>Bruce and Nott wrestled down the Soul Snakes, which enraged Dr. Drain, who (yes, in the first round) flipped his Tower Destruction switch (timer: 2). Professor Right raced to unplug the destruction mechanism, but in doing so pulled the wrong plug and imprisoned himself in a hanging electric cage (which had previously housed a shape-shifting tiger, which was now pacing on the ground underneath).<br/><br/>Cut back to Bruce and Nott, who vanquish the snakes. Bruce races to the Soul Extraction Tower, whilst Dr. Drain pulls out a remote control and presses it to cause something on Nott to start beeping. The new threat is... What is Nott's mysterious upgrade?!<br/><br/>Now, at this point, Professor Right has a brilliant idea. Cause the cage to fall, thus squishing the tiger. In the fiction, it kills two threats at once. Our first rules dilemma: <b>What happens when a Danger Patroller wants to divide an 'attack' against two opponents?</b> I feel like this should be possible. I house-ruled that she could just roll over extra successes from the cage onto the tiger. Another solution would be to divide your dice amongst the two threats.<br/><br/>Nott overcomes his (its?) personal dilemma, which thus reveals Nott's upgrade. Dr. Drain paid his mechanics to install a Matter Duplication Responder. Now, with the press of the remote's OTHER button, Dr. Drain replicates Nott. The new threat is Evil 2nd Nott. Now, Nott decides to use its Detachable Head to deal with the evil Nott and also get at that remote simultaneously. Next rules dilemma: We had no idea how to model this. Does the head and the body each get a full attack with full dice, also adding a bonus die? Do they do one of the "dividing attacks" options I suggested above, adding a bonus die? Is it intended that they only have a single mechanical attack, but narratively they're doing two things at once? If they're "attached" to a threat right now, is the Detachable Flying Head a way to attack a different threat without abandoning your current threat? <br/><br/>More happened - the soul extraction tower crumbled! Dr. Drain was defeated! After killing Evil Nott, real Nott fell in love with it and needed to be supported emotional by its peers. Bruce Eerie got sucked into Dimension X! But I need to go and can't summarize those in detail.<br/><br/>I've got more mechanical questions about Danger Patrol, coming soon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220348/#Comment_220348" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T12:07:49+00:00" title="July 23, 2009 12:07PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your first question: I think John has answered that when dividing attacks, he has just divided the hits between the two targets. <br/><br/>Your second question: my inclination would be to say, you don't get two actions unless you have an action chip to spend (oh, make that 2 power chips). Instead, you choose which body the camera is focussed on right now, and do that one - then when it's your next turn, the camera switches to your other body (or head) if you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220417/#Comment_220417" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T15:32:02+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  3:32PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dividing hits on two different threats is good if that's what's happening in the fiction -- usually when one attack finishes off one threat and then carries over to another one. The falling cage example is perfect for this.<br/><br/>Splitting up your dice between two threats is probably better for a case where someone is <i>hoping</i> to be able to hit two threats at once, but both could miss. Like a crazy trick shot or something like that.<br/><br/>For the Detachable Flying Head, I play it by ear. In the moment, sometimes it means an extra action, like, "I wrestle the ape and then shoot my head at the control panel!" so you do two rolls. After that, I'd cut back and forth like Darren suggests. Sometimes the flying head just helps out an action, like using it for a distraction or something, so in that case it's just one roll with a bonus die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220498/#Comment_220498" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T22:42:10+00:00" title="July 23, 2009 10:42PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>For the Detachable Flying Head, I play it by ear.
