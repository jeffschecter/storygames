That's 2 for 2 for Memento Mori. Nice work, Jared.<br/><br/>I was looking at UnSpeakable because I've got a couple hardcore CoC fans who might get a kick out of it. Maybe. IMO UnSpeakable is a way-better iteration of the genre/style, where saving the world requires someone sacrifice their sanity. <br/><br/>Anyway, has anyone come up with an equivalent for the Client Chart from InSpectres? Like a "Horror From Beyond" chart? I suppose the InSpectres chart would work; the "client" would be the characters' first contact with the Horror, or something. <br/><br/>Also, any actual play reports out there for UnSpeakable?<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
