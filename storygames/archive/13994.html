Newman at Dreamation, he said something that has stuck with me:<br/><br/>"You have to make a lot of shit before you make something good"<br/><br/>I may be paraphrasing here, and we were talking half about art and half about game design, but in my own endeavors it has been particularly encouraging to remember that nobody is awesome right off the bat and that everyone ends up with failed playtests, broken mechanics, and projects gone wrong. Nobody becomes a gaming rock star overnight, and those that think they do probably need a swift kick to the ego. Or help with their psychosis.<br/><br/>Anyway, I want to hear about some of those Chernobyl projects. What were some of your grand ideas that, in retrospect, were completely absurd? Tell me the story of the ashes of game designs that have crashed and burned. <br/><br/>One story I have heard so far was from a vampire LARP that my friend designed for months from scratch. He made the mistake of failing to playtest before a large session... And fifteen minutes into the game people started dropping out like flies hit with mustard gas. People began to come up to him, asking to play something else because they just weren't having fun. He has since moved on to better things, but says that moments such as those are important learning tools and, ultimately, made him better at what he does.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317163/#Comment_317163" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-19T07:45:41+00:00" title="March 19, 2011  7:45AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2011 2:17PM by jenskot.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best artists I know throw out at least 3 ideas (sometimes dozens) before getting what they want.

Or at least something was bad about them (sometimes it's not the idea but the execution). <br/><br/>These ideas didn't work out for multiple reasons...<br/><br/><b>1. Play D&amp;D backwards.</b> Start at level 20 and every adventure you lose a level as you play through your past. <br/><br/><b>2. Reverse Call of Cthulhu.</b> The players do everything they can to drive their character crazy and the GMs job is to keep them sane.<br/><br/><b>3. RPGs to confront fears.</b> I consulted with a few therapists and designed a game where you took minor fears and created fictional analogies that you could safely confront. We had a process where world creation was inspired by how we dream, so every element in the world was really an aspect of yourself in an effort to inspire internal introspection on your fictional journey. <br/><br/><b>4. Severance.</b> Inspired by the TV show the Wire. You play multiple characters, multiple sides of a conflict revolving around layoffs. You play Human Resources and the employees in a company that needs to lay off 30% of its work force. <br/><br/><b>5. Smash.</b> A miniature wargame where the punishment for failing rolls was roleplaying! Every time you failed in combat, you had to roleplay for a length of time determined by the extent of your tactical failure.<br/><br/><b>6. Blackout.</b> You play normal every day people facing the sudden realities of an all out alien invasion. The mechanics were very cool but I found the situation to be a drag. Characters lacked agency. It felt more like an exercise in roleplaying fear and running away a lot. Even in horror games, you generally can be proactive. You could be proactive in this game as well but a lot of time was spent building characters that felt very real (the character sheet was composed primarily of real life demographic and medical information) that in play it felt more realistic just to run away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ally%20Nauss" title="Ally Nauss"><img alt="Ally Nauss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ally%20Nauss">Ally Nauss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317164/#Comment_317164" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-19T08:39:33+00:00" title="March 19, 2011  8:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>The best artists I know throw out at least 3 ideas (sometimes dozens) before getting what they want.

Some of my best writing has been done by throwing as man ideas out there as possible in the beginning before realizing which direction to go.<br/><br/>For a personal share, in high school I made a board game similar to The Game of Life, only the journey was a pregnancy. The start was conception and the end was birth. There were "road blocks" like "Oops, you miscarried! Start over!" and one of the last tiles was called "Still Birth". I must have been smoking some pretty strong crack to think that was an even remotely good idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317167/#Comment_317167" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-19T09:06:37+00:00" title="March 19, 2011  9:06AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In his excellent autobiography, animator Chuck Jones talks about his first day at art school.

The idea was that the game would get nastier and uglier as it progressed from fantasy to uncomfortable reality and that the mechanics would break down and be remade as the game progressed. I was burned out on D&amp;D at this point, and the campaign was my personal, "Fuck you." In retrospect, this was an awful idea, as the result was less "I'm having a moral crisis" and more "Why the hell did I lose my flaming halberd?"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/><b>4.
