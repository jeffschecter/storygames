I may do an English version, but that depends on interest and time. I may upload a presentation of the game in English. For now, I am more than willing to discuss the game here. First, let me present:<br/><br/><strong>Montsegur 1244</strong><br/><br/>A story game about burning for your beliefs<br/><br/><em>Do you denounce your cathar beliefs and do you wish to recieve the gift of grace from the merciful father?</em><br/><br/>This was the question to several hundred Cathars who in March 1244 surrendered to the army that had beseiged the fortress for more than 9 months. More than 200 answered no and thereby chose to be burnt at the stake. Who were these people who chose to die for their beliefs?<br/><br/>In Montsegur 1244, the players together create a story about who the Cathars were. Each player takes on the role of one of the beseiged Cathars who in the end will face the choice between life and faith.\n<ul>\n<li>Number of players: 3-6</li>\n<li>Playing time: 3-4 hours</li>\n</ul>\nAn excellent write up of the Cathars and the fall of Montsegur can be found <a href="http://www.russianbooks.org/montsegur.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

It is designed to be played straight from the box with no preparation and with no game master. With no game master, the game needs to break the initial ice and convince the players that the trip will be worth the while. Also, the visual playing aids helps focus everyones attention to the game and suggests what is going to happen next.<br/><br/>Then about the stories that the game can evoke. I am fascinated about the historical event, especially this one choice that these people have to make. Can we today understand why people willingly choose death rather than buy into compromises? The details of the historical event are plenty - but so are the myths - and we really cannot answer the why's, just the what's. But we can guess at the why's, and story games is a very fun way to do this. I want the players to bring their ideas to the table and mix them into one story that answers some of the why's.<br/><br/>So how does the game works?<br/><br/>There is a framing story which is locked. Montsegur is beseiged and surrenders after 9 months where the Cathars are burnt at the stake. This background story is told through 6 acts, where a short text is read aloud and the heretic marker is moved one step closer to the fire.<br/><br/>12 named characters are provided which are distributed between the players at the start of the game. Each player choose one as their main character. They play the remaining roles as supporting characteres. Each character is presented very briefly with a picture, sex, age, function and relations. Also, each character is given three questions that helps the player to explore the character during the game. <br/><br/>Players take turns in setting and describing scenes. Some are played out, some are told. A currency system allows players to take over a scene from another player. Two kinds of cards help bring ideas into the game. This allows a player to introduce e.g. the grail, a traitor, a miracle, a mercenary etc. There is no mechanics for conflicts. <br/><br/>So what kind of game is this? <br/><br/>Basically, I created a game that I wanted to play and that I haven't seen anybody else doing. But if you look closely, you might find a little Unce Upon A Time, a little Roach, and maybe even some Dread in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123917/#Comment_123917" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T07:48:15+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  7:48AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you had a chance to playtest?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Further development was mainly on presentation and language, but also to sharpen the content a bit. <br/><br/>I have a few more play tests coming up before Fastaval.<br/><br/>There is always a great deal of uncertainty about how it plays with players coming with different backgrounds, expectations and playing tradition. I hope to attract the right crowd. I want to get to the people who are into inventing their own stories, but who also appreciates a framework to help the group process. What I do not want is for the players to recreate a story of my invention. I prefer an unpolished story with odd corners to the discovery of a smooth underlying story.

Are you referring more to the scene structure or to the inevitability of the characters' decision?<br/><br/>Who have you been playtesting this with?  Traditional roleplayers?  Indie roleplayers?  Non-gamers?  I'd be curious what sorts of feedback you've gotten during your playtests.  I can tell by your comments that this is meant to be played by people who don't necessarily have experience with GM-less play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frederik J.

Act 1 begins with the crusading army besieging the castle in May 1243. Act 2 begins when the crusading army decides to stay for the winter. Act 3 begins with a group of crusading army volunteers who climb a steep cliff side in the middle of the night and takes the eastern fortress by surprise. Act 4 begins with negotiation of terms in March 1244. The Epilogue is the burning of the Cathars.<br/><br/>Between these fix points, the players invent and play out scenes of their own. Telling all the little stories about a mothers griefs over her lost children, a young mans love for a woman he can't have, a young womans wanting for the world outside etc. Maybe we get to know why the arch bishop so vigillantly pursues the Cathars. Maybe we meet a templar knight who carries the Holy Grail to safety through the enemy lines. Maybe the Cathars do worship the devil and perform satanic rituals.<br/><br/>As for the final choice of the player characters, there is a rule that states that at most one can escape, and at least one must choose to burn. I need more play testing to verify this rule, but the idea is to keep the tragic feel. I don't want two persons to run away together in the end.<br/><br/>A sample character:<br/><br/><b>Phillipa</b><br/>Woman. Daughter of Corba and the lord of Montsegur, Raimond de P\xe9reille, and married to his cousin, Pierre Roger.<br/><br/>\u2022\tWho is the father of the child you carry in your womb?<br/>\u2022\tWhy are you and your mother not speaking?<br/>\u2022\tWhat do your fear most?<br/><br/>- and then a picture. Corba, Raimond and Pierre Roger are three other characters.<br/><br/>I playtested it with a selected group of people that I have played with on different occasions. All have 10+ years of roleplaying experience and all had tried e.g. Dogs, Roach, or Polaris. Strong scene framing skills are important so I sort of expect that it plays best with people who have some GM experience, but on the other hand, I have been pleasantly surprised before when playing off-the-beaten-track-games with rookie players.<br/><br/>Tell me more about how you play scenes and what kind of games, you play. Have you played PTA? Have you played games where scene framing was not all done by a single player (GM)? What is your preferred ratio of conflict scenes to exposition scenes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124070/#Comment_124070" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T05:54:20+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  5:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2008 5:54AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Frederik, <br/><br/>So you've built a big relationship map between the available characters, right?  Why did you choose to have a larger pool of characters, more characters than players?  It seems like Phillipa might be short changed if nobody chooses Corba, Raimond, or Pierre Roger.  IS that possible?  I can see this working just fine as long as each character has at lest one connection to another player's connection, though, so maybe it's mathematically impossible for someone to be left without in-game player character relationships.<br/><br/>I love the "maximum one escapes, minimum one burns" rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

E.g. in a four player game, each player controls three characters. However, each player pick one of their characters as their main character. Just as you in A Day in the Life played three characters, but put your focus on telling one of the stories. I find having cards with names and pictures is an excellent way to quickly signal and remind everyone which one of your characters you are currently playing. I.e. you can push that card forward when you enter a scene and people can recall the name with a quick glance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is another rule: Main characters cannot die before the Epilogue. Other characters can die only with the consent of their controlling player.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose the setup with 12 characters to give the players a lot of room to choose their path into the game. At the same time, restricting the characters to a closed set assures a good spread wrt. age &amp; sex. There is one boy, one girl, one young man, one young woman etc. Thus the players are reminded that the Cathars are as varied as any other community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

And the scenes which don't involve rolling the dice are usually quick explanation scenes or some sort of interstitial, often done by me as the GM.  The rest of the time we are pushing to use the dice, which is how the rules are designed.<br/><br/>I have only played PTA once, and it wasn't a good enough session to really understand how the scene framing is supposed to work in that game.  I have played The Roach several times, and other GM-less games such as Contenders and Best Friends.<br/><br/>In my limited experience, I find that people who are used to GM'd games can get a little lost when there are scenes that don't end up in a conflict.  So they are roleplaying around looking for the conflict that isn't there.  Personally, in those types of games I prefer maybe 80% of the scenes to end in some sort of conflict.  The rest either don't come to a head, or they are short scenes where someone is flashing back or describing a bit of color or what is going on "in the background".<br/><br/>I think if the exposition scenes were inherent in the structure of a game (like Burning Empires), it would probably be easier to add that bit of color without feeling the "pressure" to force a conflict.<br/><br/>I am curious how the "rookie" players approach the game differently than the scene-framing "veterans".  Do the rookies tend to take to the scene-framing quicker than the RP-vets who don't have much GM experience?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Well, how do you know when to use the conflict mechanic in a game with such a system? The answers is that the players need to know when to pick up the dice. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Montsegur 1244, one player owns the scene at a time. This player does all the mediation and resolution, just as a classic game master with absolute authority over everything except the player characters. However, another player can use a token and take over the control of a scene at any time. The scene stops when the player in control want it to stop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124254/#Comment_124254" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T04:28:32+00:00" title="February  4, 2008  4:28AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really want to play this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
