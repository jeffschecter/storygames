The elements need to be specific - eg a faction - each with its own box shape. There are rules about the order in which players add elements to the chart and their linkages. It works incredibly well.<br/><br/>Then you roleplay an adventure in that world. I've played it once and it easily created a world worthy of its own TV series. <br/><br/>Much better, however, is the fact that - for an experiment - someone once used Intrepid to create a Steampunk world with the specific intent of using it as a background to run games based on my Steampunk rules. He and a group of friends created the world in a single session of Intrepid but he's been using it - "The Victorian Colony of Mars" - as a background for scenarios ever since. Scenarios so good that I "acquire" copies every time I meet him.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking to start a new campaign for any system, but need some ideas, I'd recommend running a game of Intrepid first to see if you can't get a world you'll love.<br/><br/>(Not my game.

My favourite is the Quarantine, which has a list of "start of session" questions you take turns answering as you go along. <br/><br/>The reason this is cool is because it means that, session by session, the group starts fleshing out the history of the apocalypse and we gradually, step by step, learn about what kind of game we're actually playing. It's especially cool in that you can internalize it as the *character* starting to regain some of their memories, if you're into that angle.<br/><br/>That's pretty interesting, because we don't need to set up a whole lot *before* the game. Simply choosing that playbook means that things will develop in a certain direction as we play. The question prompts lead us to create more and more of this material, session by session, which feels like a process of *discovery*.<br/><br/>I'd love to see more of that in game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X" title="Charlie_X"><img alt="Charlie_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/513/nSBLNVCY6RNQO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X">Charlie_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463690/#Comment_463690" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-04T13:37:43+00:00" title="June  4, 2017  1:37PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used Quiet Year to set up an Apocalypse World campaign. More specifically I used Our Last Best Hope's Curse the Darkness playbook to show everyone the apocalypse, then we fast-forwarded to Quiet Year, then to AW after that. I'm tempted to bring that world forward again in time for AW2E, building further on what we established.<br/><br/>We used a Quiet Year-ish method of making the campaign world for Dungeon World. I put in the capital city and its' deal, then got everyone else to take turns adding a landmark, a civilisation and a problem to the world map. We managed to tag in pretty much all of them, even if it was in players' backstories or unsolved mysteries which people did their best to avoid for their own sanity.<br/><br/>Fiasco has a massively lengthy amount of prep time which is why it's great they made it really fun. Final Girl specifically suggesting starting by talking about your favourite horror movies is a good tone-setter, as is making a bunch of horror stereotypes you know will mostly be dead by the game's end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal" title="yochaigal"><img alt="yochaigal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/885/nLZYCQ6WJ20JO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yochaigal">yochaigal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463704/#Comment_463704" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-05T01:51:29+00:00" title="June  5, 2017  1:51AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perilous Wilds for Dungeon World is pretty great; I also like Microscope &amp; Questlandia are cool. <br/><br/>I'd love to see the world-builder for Inconceivable.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463705/#Comment_463705" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-05T02:18:08+00:00" title="June  5, 2017  2:18AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2017 7:12AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I'd love to see the world-builder for Inconceivable.<br/>- yochaigal </blockquote>\nPaul, if you ever write the game out please send it to me and I'll have Story Games SLC playtest it.

The type of humor and world and characters etc. Not precisely, the story and world and characters should be the players own but  they should be animated and inspired and emulate the movie's spirit. I think you should watch the movie again and take copious notes, and think about and playtest procedures that will result in the tone and type of story that is exhibited. It's worth doing and I'm not sure that it's been done, the more specific the goal, and the more directed  and explicit the tone, the better the game is going to be, and the better the stories are going to be.  Look at what Jason was able to do with Fiasco by being percise and making clear the type of story that was being told, and having the proceeders/mechanics to back it up.  Anyway, that's my take :-) thanks :-)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463776/#Comment_463776" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T14:56:41+00:00" title="June  9, 2017  2:56PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jeff!<br/><br/>I appreciate it.
