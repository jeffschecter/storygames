Cthulhu with Sanity and Mythos, a gain for one is a loss for the other. Or the Shock version being something like Love / Hate in a pair. <br/><br/>And lots of games have shifting stats. WOD with its temporary and permanent Willpower, Glamour, Banality, etc which are mostly treated like resources, but sometimes also rolled. The recent Masks PBTA game has made shifting stats one of the center pieces of its design. <br/><br/>But I'm curious if any games, especially PBTA games have combined the two. Specifically an opposing pair of stats that shift based on play. <br/><br/>For example, if you were to do a PBTA back for Changeling the Dreaming, an obvious opposing pair would be Banality vs Glamour. Some moves would use Banality, other moves Glamour. But you can't have a high stat in both. Say a range of 3-0-3. Where a +3 to one would be a -3 to be other. During play and by making certain moves (or failing certain moves) you can shift that bonus one step at a time in either direction, but capped at +3. A score of zero would be balanced. <br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>Banality &lt;-&gt; Glamour<br/>+3 +2 +1 0 +1 +2 +3<br/><br/>You start with a +2 in Glamour which is functionally equivalent to a -2 in Banality. So Glamour moves are easier, but Banality moves are harder. You roll a 6- on a Glamour move and your stat could shift down (Banality goes up), conversely when you succeed on a Glamour move your Glamour could shift up (Banality goes down). The reverse is also true. Banality makes you resistant to magic, Glamour helps you use magic. So they're both desirable, though possibly not the greatest example. <br/><br/>My initial thought was 3-4 of these pairs as the stats for a hack. Possibly a not-Changeling game, but not necessarily. I think it could generally work in a lot of ways. <br/><br/>Is this something that's been done before? If so, by whom? If not, does that sound like it would be an interesting mechanic at the table?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452177/#Comment_452177" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-12T21:53:20+00:00" title="April 12, 2016  9:53PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a>,<br/><br/>Take a look at the Angel playbook for Monsterhearts!<br/><br/>Here's another example:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20591/the-ward-medical-drama-powered-by-the-apocalypse-looking-for-playtesters-and-feedback" rel="nofollow">The Ward</a><br/><br/>It has a "heart" stat, which helps you with one move but hinders you in another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452180/#Comment_452180" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-13T03:24:50+00:00" title="April 13, 2016  3:24AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Greg Stolze's <b>A Dirty World</b> has this as the core mechanic, actually!  <a href="http://www.gregstolze.com/adirtyworld/ADWCharSheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">You can see the stat pairs on the character sheet</a>. They don't start out butting up against one another, but as you improve stats, they quickly contact. Then, when you would improve one, you must decrease the other.<br/><br/>This is most pertinent during combat, where taking hits can actually slide your focus from one half of a stat pair to the other. One called out in the book is Courage/Wrath: Courage is for fighting when outnumbered, but if all the Courage gets beaten out of you, then you've stockpiled loads of Wrath, which is for fighting people weaker than you. So if you were getting physically trounced by a stronger person, and your Courage got beaten into Wrath, you could pull out a gun, and (since you now have the overwhelming power advantage) start using that Wrath to fight back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452182/#Comment_452182" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-13T07:25:36+00:00" title="April 13, 2016  7:25AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not shifting stats, but in <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/159873/Monster-Force-Terra" rel="nofollow">Monster Force Terra</a>, the only stat used is <b>Size</b>, which can range from -1 (a monster the size of a car) to +3 (a monster the size of a skyscraper.)<br/><br/>You roll+Size for all the basic moves, but in half of them a 6- is a miss and a 10+ is a perfect success, whereas in the other half a 10+ is a miss and a 6- is a perfect success, e.g. a large Size is an advantage when you're attacking your enemies but a hindrance when you're trying to move unimpeded.

I'd been mulling over this thread in silence, fingers arched, waiting for the right time to slam down some definitive thought on sliding result ranges as part of an "atom splitting" move. <br/><br/>I'm not sure that time has been reached yet, but I should let you in on what I was thinking:<br/><br/>Sliding ranges as represented by tokens on a numberline* denoting the failure DC and the great success DC. <br/><br/>These ranges then change based on either rolled success and failures - perhaps a choice on failing a roll is to avoid consequence but increase the difficulty on the sliding range - or external fronts (such as going deeper into the dungeon, or whathaveyou). <br/><br/>This idea, for me, could be used to enhance party/team experience in play as the whole party is shooting for the same DCs, <i>Lacuna Part 1.</i> style. <br/><br/>So, fertile ground but I've not quite managed to grow anything yet.

Players only have to remember the results (which are fairly distinct and thus easily remembered for different moves), not the range numbers.<br/><br/>If you were going to have some moves be +stat and some -stat, it would make sense for the result ranges to be symmetrical around 7, so they'd be 5-, 6-8, 9+. Everything would then be "one easier" than AW for positive stats, so maybe cap stats at +2 instead of +3, and start with +1 instead of +2 for "prime requisite" stats.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452570/#Comment_452570" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T20:28:26+00:00" title="April 23, 2016  8:28PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Urban Shadows you shift your Faction stats in this way over time.

They renamed the 6 Approaches for flavour, and then paired them in 3 opposing axis: Bold x Subtle, Clever x Mighty, Wise x Swift. Each of these 3 poles get a gauge with 3 tiers in every Approach centering at zero. Each gauge has a token marking where in the progress bar the character's is at.<br/><br/>Everytime a player spends a Fate point, that token in the gauge with the Approach used moves one step up. So, ideally there will be a lot of moving around since once an Approach reaches tier 3, it'll only take one more step to turn that character into a Monster (usually an NPC).<br/><br/>An intention gauge should look like this:<br/><br/>BOLD [ ] - 3 - [ ] - [ ] - 2 - [ ] - 1 - 0 - 1 - [ ] - 2 - [ ] - [ ] - 3 - [ ] SUBTLE                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
