Want to lend a hand to the coolest game convention north of the border?<br/><br/>We're putting together prize packages for participants in <a href="http://www.hammercon.ca" rel="nofollow">HammerCon</a> events and would love to be able to give out a copy of your signed game! Here's how it works:<br/><br/>You notify me in this thread (feel free to whisper if you prefer) or by <a href="mailto:events@hammercon.ca" rel="nofollow">email</a> of which game(s) you'd like to donate. Include your email address. Feel free to specify your preference in how you'd like the game to be used; as a prize for participation in a given event (such as our <a href="http://www.hammercon.ca/node/69" rel="nofollow">Call of Cthulhu tournament</a>, <a href="http://www.hammercon.ca/node/73" rel="nofollow">Speed Gaming</a>, <a href="http://www.hammercon.ca/node/70" rel="nofollow">Great Canadian Board Game Blitz</a> (for board games), or whatever), as a door prize to a random attendee, as a prize for best costume or our coveted Endurance prize (given out for 18 hours of straight gaming), for inclusion in the convention library for play at the convention, or whatever other idea you have.<br/><br/>I email you the mailing address for convention support. We'll pay you $5 USD by PayPal to cover your shipping charges if you wish (if you want to send a bigger shipment let me know and we'll work it out).<br/><br/>You grab a decent-looking copy of your game from the box of games you have in your attic, basement, or garage. Sign it! Then mail it to us. We'll send you the shipping reimbursement upon receipt. Feel free to stuff whatever advertisements you like into the game as well and it'll be given out to the recipient.<br/><br/>Email us a black-and-white graphic advertising the game, your company, your dog, or whatever you like. It has be suitable for 2" by 2" print. We'll print that ad in our convention program which all attendees receive.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288699/#Comment_288699" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T08:45:50+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  8:45AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a wonderful offer and Hammercon has its shit together, in case you were wondering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290501/#Comment_290501" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T12:57:27+00:00" title="August 31, 2010 12:57PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>This is a wonderful offer and Hammercon has its shit together, in case you were wondering.</blockquote>\nY'all should listen to Jason. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>We're talking about a spare copy of your game, a quick scribble, and a short trip to the post office in exchange for print advertisement and getting your game in the hands of people who will actually play it with actual physical people. We really do plug the bleep out of our supporters, so you'll get fantastic value for your time and efforts.<br/><br/><a href="mailto:events@hammercon.ca" rel="nofollow">Email</a>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
