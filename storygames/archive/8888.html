The biggest question i'm running into is the mechanical essence of the "No Miscast" checkbox.  Namely how much you're allowed to futz with it before you break the game.<br/><br/>I'll post the Domains, the Spells, a link to them, and then let you guys tell me if the "Paint" method is broken or not.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196502/#Comment_196502" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T19:53:54+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  7:53PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Site:  <a href="http://metagate.wikidot.com/drewstorm-spells" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://metagate.wikidot.com/drewstorm-spells</a><br/><br/><i>The Handwritten Stuff:</i><br/><br/><b>Blood and Bone</b> - (Self-Transformation, Healing)<br/>Blood and Bone is the study of Healing and Transforming one's own body through Paint, Tattoos, and Ceremony. This is the Domain of Shaman's and Healers.<br/><br/><b>Earth and Sky</b> - (Command of Elements)<br/>Earth and Sky is the Domain of manipulating the non-living elements of Nature through relics and ceremonies performed in alignment with the Earth and Sky.<br/><br/><b>Path and Bow</b> - (Basically, it's Household)<br/>Path and Bow is the Domain of secret arts developed by the Blackfoot Nation to help survival and life within the Tribes. It is the art of creating objects (tools and shelters, etc) and seeking safety.<br/><br/><b>The Spirit World</b> - (Communion and Blessings of the Spirit World)<br/>The Spirit World is a Domain pertaining to knowledge of Spirits and the world they walk in.<br/><br/><b>The Wilds</b> - (Communion and Blessings of the Natural World)<br/>The Wilds is a Domain pertaining to knowledge of the Natural World, it's beasts and it's threats.<br/><br/><i>The Conceptual Tangle:</i><br/>I want to capture the nature of Tribal Magic by steering away from simple words and gestures for spellcasting. In that, looking to what little i actually know about the occult in the Native American world, i propose these sources of actually casting a spell:<br/><br/> <b>"Medium"</b> - Almost all the spells incorporate a physical act or object to make them happen. I tried to make it to where all spells have a Medium, even if that Medium is just a description of the stuff that comes about due to the spell.<br/><br/> <b>Chants and Dances</b> - these are the equivalent of Words and Gestures. Not very different, i know. But i'm going to refer to them as 'Chants and Dances' so that it feels like Native American. The only reason i bring this up is simple: If you don't have Combat Magic, then Spellcasting is supposed to be your action for the round, right? And the threat to that is 1) you don't get your spell to happen or 2) you get your spell to happen, but you miscast. Chants and Dances are the instigation of Spellcasting. You fail your roll, and the spell does not happen, then it's because you were interrupted during the Dance or Chant.  It's a representation of you completing the Chant or Dance, but you were distracted enough that it happened in a warped way, causing the spell to go awry.<br/>          o Spells which use Chants cannot be cast if you are Gagged.<br/>          o Spells which use a Dance cannot be cast if you are bound or broken.<br/>          o Spells that use "Prayers" are simply Chant Spells that can be spoken silently or in the mind. Generally these are less powerful for Combat actions, and will later have a rules mechanic to represent their being more subject to Miscast from Green Dice played against them.<br/><br/> <b>Talismans</b> - Talismans can be two things in this game: Spellbooks or the source of a Spell. If a Spell <i>requires</i> a Talisman, it means there is a process the Character must go through to create the Talisman. The benefit is that the Spell works as a Paint Spell (see next) only with Miscast Boxes that do not increase with each cast. The Downside is that there is a chance the Talisman can be broken, or the link with it destroyed.  (i haven't yet decided if the Talisman must be on the person)<br/><br/> <b>Paint</b> - originally i thought that Paint would just be a cool Spellbook. I've decided, however, to make it a primary source for causing Magic to happen. Paint will work slightly different from Chants and Dances because you can't 'Miscast.' Since this would throw off the balance of the game pretty severely, however, the replacement mechanic will work the exact same way, only with a different word. The "Miscast" aspect will be called "Fading." What this means is, when you apply the Paint - which must happen before a battle, or over several rounds in battle, if you absolutely have to have it happen - the Paint is fading from your body, and with it the powers it carries. Basically you are creating the Miscast boxes as Fading boxes. You use the spell, the Paint fades, making it harder and harder to access the Arcane Powers. Cast it once? Great, check off a Fading box. Use it again? Fine, check off two. And so on, just like Miscasting. In fact, if you choose not to check off a Fading box you will have to roll on a Fading Table, that i'll make up later. For now it's the same as the Miscast Table. (shrug)<br/>          o Paint Spells cannot be stopped by Effort (Green Dice). They just happen at your will.<br/>          o Paint Spells are extremely hard to Cast. Therefore you pretty much cast them before you ever use them, in a controlled environment, and not in Combat. When in Combat you just\u2026do them. But if you say "I want to cast Blessing of War Paint" then you'll have to take more than a few rounds to do it. Any time you want to say "I'm Casting x" in a scene that's not Combat, awesome, we'll roll it up and lay it down.  In combat is a problem, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
