I though I would remember names and I don't. Arg.<br/><br/>Tonight I played in a play test for Houses of the blooded run by Joe Harney.  We played the introductory adventure from the book.  Maybe it's good I can't remember names as I don't want to give any spoilers.  Of course, as it happened that is probably impossible, the game went all over.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What rocked:</span><br/><br/>Limited Narrative Control.  I really, really, <em>really</em> liked the method of metering out narrative control.  Clearly John has taken what he did with Wilderness of Mirrors and greatly refined it. Not only did the limitations keep things narrow, but it also helped focus our decisions.<br/><br/>Joe's descriptions were florid and evocative. Clearly the Venn society was one that resonated with him.  He got courtly intrigue, tragedy and violence. His blood is a shade darker than mine.<br/><br/>Invoking your name.  I think I said "I am Drail, I am your friend like 50 times tonight, it was classic."<br/><br/>Declarations.  Using wisdom and cunning checks to define the scene were great.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What could have been improved:</span><br/><br/>For a play test it was fine, but we needed some player aids: Name cards and a list of sample NPC names that we could use for making up characters.<br/><br/>Also, one problem I have with games that have such good mechanics is that sometimes players jump to the dice too quickly.  There were a bunch of times when I didn't know whether I should roll first and then role play or the other way around.  I think when everything you do requires a roll, sometimes its hard to get into your character because you're constantly shifting back to the meta game elements.  Familiarity with the system would probably solve this, but this is a good case of leading by example.  I think in games like this the GM needs to show some examples of NPCs making decelerations and such so the players have an easier time getting a grasp of how it works.<br/><br/>Wow, I'm tired when I have a hard time spelling the word "how".  I may remember more in the morning, but for tonight, that was my Houses of the Blooded experience.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171661/#Comment_171661" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T07:13:09+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  7:13AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sean Nittner</cite><br/><br/>For a play test it was fine, but we needed some player aids: Name cards and a list of sample NPC names that we could use for making up characters.<br/></blockquote>\nThere is a page in the book, at the end of the chargen chapter, that has a list of names and the ven translations.
