We did have a WoW-ish based show called Guilds of Steel, and there was talk a year or two back about doing a Lovecrafty-type thing based on our experience with the Roach, but it never came about. Play-wise, there's a bit of crossover here and there (in a Play Unsafe kind of way), which I think has really enriched things, from both directions. As far as games go, my first (very amateur) attempt at a story game design for one of the Ronnies was strongly influenced by an improv exercise (the Story Spine), and I've got a bunch of notes towards turning one of the other long-form narrative formats we did last year (Cochise!, the improvised 70s cop show) into an RPG, but that's in the very early stages.<br/><br/>There's been some cross-pollination in the social circles - some of my gaming buddies taking improv classes, and dragging some other improvisers into playing some games - which has been pretty fun, as well. The two things are so close, in my mind, that I'm constantly surprised that there isn't more of an overlap.</blockquote>\nAround here I know we recruited our dear friend Joe Stanton straight out of improv into our gaming group, and there's been a little crossover there.  I also have "non-gamer friends" who are glad to game with us.  They are really good gamers.<br/><br/>So let's talk about social cross-pollination a bit - how do you get the peanut butter of gaming mixed up with the chocolate of other parts of your life, and vice-versa?  The improv connection is pretty strong and obvious, but surely there are other social circles where the Venn diagrams cross nicely - book clubs?  Gun clubs?  We're multifaceted people with lots of interests and I'm curious which ones intersect most happily.<br/><br/>(I will buy the first copy of Cochise!, by the way.

The best way I have found is to learn what their hobbies and interests are, then find a game with a premise that incorporates their talents or knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I have one friend who was a HUGE fan of Neil Gaiman, particularly <i>American Gods</i> and <i>Sandman</i>. I introduced her to RPGs with Nobilis.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife loves fantasy literature, <i>Dune</i> and <i>Game of Thrones</i> among them. She has a theater background. Her first real exposure to RPGing was a BW game where she played an orphaned noble involved in political intrigue in a desert wasteland city-state.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that keeping people within their comfort zone is key.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the best example in my life came about relatively recently. My band offered up one of our demo tracks to be included with Joe McDonald's game <i>Ribbon Drive</i>. None of my bandmates have had too much exposure to gaming in the past, but are now all A LOT more interested, especially after they looked through the copy that he sent us (where everyone can create their own music CD and bring it to the table). I truly think that Ribbon Drive could do wonders for this kind of 'cross-pollination', especially amongst indie music and indie film circles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234080/#Comment_234080" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T11:05:49+00:00" title="September 24, 2009 11:05AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's not talk about recruitment, actually.

I'm just wondering about other parallel communities - knitters, Rand Youth cells, whatever - that cross pollinate.  Also, how do these things impact each other?

Steph and I started <a href="http://firan.legendary.org" rel="nofollow">FiranMUX</a> after running a Firan tabletop game for 18 months for some local friends. Over the 12-13 years of the MUX, I've made dozens of good friends and many more great acquaintances. A bunch of them ended up gaming with me on the tabletop at least once or twice. <br><br>I use what I know about tabletop GMing to make Firan better. Similarly, what I learn about running a large LARP-like game (the MUX) gives me interesting ideas for running tabletop games. Steph and I (mostly Steph, okay) wrote a LARP that entertained 40-70 players at a time for four hours. That was quite a learning experience.<br><br>A lot of what I read is centered around MMO design, too, so I bring those ideas to my tabletop gaming and vice versa.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234090/#Comment_234090" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T11:48:04+00:00" title="September 24, 2009 11:48AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jason">@Jason</a>: It sure ought to be, yes.

For years Gen Con and Pensic have conflicted which kept a lot of people from attending one or the other (but there are a lot of SCA merchants at Gen Con and Origins).<br/><br/>Civil War reenactors and active duty military overlap heavily with wargaming - miniatures in particular.<br/><br/>Of course Science Fiction fandom has always overlaped. Many of the Sci Fi cons are also some area's only game cons.<br/><br/>I suspect most of these groups are aging up now (SCA, Reenactors and SciFi fandom) so are they as important? I don't know. I'll be 46 in a few days and see thoses groups as being more my age or older. Are any of the rest of you touched by these groups?<br/><br/>Then there is the school/college affiliation.

At least two of my group are also in another, strictly-D&amp;D group, run by a director of a show they were both in (I say at least, because there was a third, but she dropped out of that game). Having a large contingent of actors tends to lead to a fair bit of in-depth character work, since they like to "get into their characters' heads", but it also has its drawbacks because they are often less-good at branching out and creating new hooks for themselves without some guidance. That said, once you point them in the right direction, they will creative your ass off.<br/><br/>I only know two lawyer/gamer, both of whom I met in law school. Both tend to be more Trad-oriented, preferring D&amp;D to all else (although one of them was pretty passionate about Mage back when I was running it). They aren't, generally, rules lawyers. Nomenclature aside, I've found that gaming with lawyers tends to lead to less table-dispute, because the argument structure is so formal: each player makes a pitch for their case, and then both happily agree to abide by the GM's ruling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234223/#Comment_234223" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T08:24:51+00:00" title="September 25, 2009  8:24AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite>I've found that gaming with lawyers tends to lead to less table-dispute, because the argument structure is so formal: each player makes a pitch for their case, and then both happily agree to abide by the GM's ruling.</blockquote>\nThat's wonderful.

I suppose you could make observations about various professions and how they approach gaming.<br/><br/>OK, this is slightly off-topic, but... damn that sounds nice.  I remember when I was still playing trad games I would often get horrible social feedback for asking questions of the GM that required a yes or no response.  "So, can I use this ability in combination with that other thing?"  I think was happening was people were assuming bad faith on my part\u2014that I wanted to max out my bonuses in overpowering ways.  I also think what was happening is that I was catching GMs who didn't actually know the mechanics of the games they were purporting to run very well.  So they got touchy when I asked for clarifications.  In fact in every instance I can think of, I didn't care if the answer was yes or no, I just wanted a clear ruling.<br/><br/>Anyway, I find, like others up-thread, that I do lots of non-gaming stuff with my gaming friends but have trouble bringing non-gaming folks into social situations with my gaming friends.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234350/#Comment_234350" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-26T09:41:28+00:00" title="September 26, 2009  9:41AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was working for the bookstore, I noticed that a significant portion of the staff knew about RPGs and a smaller group actually played them in groups that had nothing to do with mine.

(I don't think of them as non-nerdy; I think of them as being nerdily into politics or organic farming or art or librarianship and not gaming/nerdy media.)  These are generally not the friends I drag into playing RPGs. I have, however, dragged friends who started out interested in other "traditionally" nerdy things (sci-fi novels or TV, board games, etc) but had never or rarely played RPGs into indie games. These friends have generally enjoyed themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently though, I'm working at a tiny, politically radical non-profit where I probably wouldn't roleplay with any of my co-workers. I mentioned offhandedly to my supervisor one day that I was going to a board game night after work, and while she was very sweet about it and asked me all the right questions (who are you going with, what are you going to play), there was definitely an undercurrent of "well, that's kind of weird and nerdy." To be fair, board game night may sound totally un-fun to her because so many mainstream board games suck. Still, it's really really hard for me to explain role-playing to people with absolutely no context, especially if they not be nerdily inclined themselves, and if she was incredulous about board games then there's no play I could do roleplaying justice. So I've made the decision to keep quiet about my nerdliness at the office. I love my boss and the work I do, and I know she's liked my work so far; since I have plenty of opportunity to do nerdy hobbies outside of work, I don't feel the need to broadcast said nerdiness at work and risk the good relationship I'm developing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy activist tendencies and my gamer nerd tendencies often feel rather at odds with each other, but that is probably a topic for a separate thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235153/#Comment_235153" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T23:59:26+00:00" title="October  1, 2009 11:59PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2009 12:00AM by JDCorley.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am so obviously the office nerd that when I had only been at the office 2 weeks one of my co-workers was asking me about the X-Men.<br/><br/>Pretty much everyone knows I'm a gamer and a booster of games, and I often make recommendations for various games for various age groups of kids and fun party type games and so on.<br/><br/>PS I am the only lawyer-gamer I know around here, but I can absolutely see where law school + getting kicked in the nuts a few times in court could help you get over taking rules disputes personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235161/#Comment_235161" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T01:14:28+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  1:14AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My gaming group has recently started talking a lot about writing.
