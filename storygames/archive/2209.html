                    **<i>This is written without some of the BE fiddly bits explained.  If you have any questions about the mechanical whys and hows please ask and I will elucidate.  I do try to hash out some of the jargon for those not familiar with BE.</i>**<br/><br/>So I haven't been running my full compliment of scenes. I should be running Color/Interstitial/Building scenes for all of my involved FoNs. I did pull out two FoN<sup>1</sup> scene-sets this game. The first set was bent on healing my Iron<sup>2</sup> Artificer to affect this manuever (since he was maimed last manuever from being hulled<sup>3</sup>). I felt I had to use the artificer this manuever<sup>5</sup> to make the surgery come to fruition so I counted it as scenes from the main Vaylen, the Archcotare<sup>6</sup> - my FoN for the Userpation phase.<br/><br/>The first was the Archcotare smuggling in more of the Hulling Kits I burned last manuever (+2D advantage to Surgery rolls for field hulling). The intent was to get them in under the noses of security and the PCs. I failed that by one so I got the units in but one landed in the hands of Zlata, one of the PCs.<br/><br/>The second and third rolls were the fabrication of the Iron Hulling units<sup>7</sup> in hopes that I could actually hull several Lineman and gain a linked die to my manuever phase (the Lineman are the leaders of the Civilian Commune faction which I had assessed last manuever). I made the resource roll but failed the fabrication roll by one. Therefore I took the Gift of Kindness<sup>8</sup> (a hulled Lineman gains a specific trait from the experience - TBD) and got the equipment installed in the Iron but didn't get the linked die.<br/><br/>We rolled our maneuvers. Evan's player rolled for their Assess and succeeded, thus are able to actively lower my disposition now (something I have yet to Assess for). I successfully rolled my Take Action roll bringing the Civilian Commune and thus the Linemen under Vaylen<sup>9</sup> control.<br/><br/>All in all it was a good game and I am really looking forward to next week.<br/><br/>I have been very happy with how this game is being crafted. I was a little worried at first because I have seen some games that had sorta odd results (or at least the results were recorded in a narrative that had those strange results). This is going well. The characters beliefs are written into the game. I am setting up conflicts around their wants and needs. And in the process it's worrying them. I guess there is a certain level of "careful what you wish for." I like to be VERY clear - your BITs tell me what this game is about - but somehow my ideas tend to be a little more twisted then the others. Now they are scared that they won't be able to live up to the challenge or that they will feel useless in the process. I try to assure them all that they are doing a great job and that success and failure of these conflicts are what these games are all about, one way or the other we all have a great time telling the story.<br/><br/>Now for the problem I see happening. I have a great group of roleplayers. These are people that run when their characters are scared and look foolish when their characters become vulnerable. It's not about the winning or the losing and their characters always are rich and interesting. However, It is creating problems with the competetive atmosphere of BE. They play their characters well and then feel like they are behind because it's obvious to them that I have thought a few moves ahead. I hate feeling like my doing my job as a GM is getting in the way of them having a good time with the game. <br/><br/>To be honest I don't think it's as big of a problem as they fear. I think that now that they have found out about the Vaylen I am going to have a hard time keeping characters alive - *sigh*<br/><br/><sup>1</sup> FON = Figure of Note, a main character for the three phases.<br/><sup>2</sup> Iron is iconic fusion-powered armor, that in our game has religious significance<br/><sup>3</sup> hulled refers to drilling a hole in the skull to insert a presentient parasite - the crux of the game is about these parasites infecting the local human populations.<br/><sup>5</sup> A manuever is the three phases broken down basically by sessions where the big picture is focued on.  At the end of every manuever a FoN rolls to see whose winning the prolonged conflict.<br/><sup>6</sup> The Archcotare is basically the equivalent of a Catholic Archbishop only instead of being responsible for a city Archcotares are the spiritual leaders for entire planets.<br/><sup>7</sup> iron Hulling units were tech I burned and had the Iron Aritficer install.  It is a exp Surgeon with an extra +2 ob to Repair and Observation to find the device.  It basically uses a device I burned earlier to hull someone using the armor.  <br/><sup>8</sup> The Gift of Kindness says that if a roll is failed to burn technology then you get the item anyway but it comes with some restriction or quirk.<br/><sup>9</sup> Vaylen are the name of the parasites once they have infected a sentient being.                </div>

                            I mean ... if they've just found out about the Vaylen then it's perfectly reasonable for them to feel that they are behind, and that the Vaylen have thought things out several steps ahead of them whatever they choose to do.  That sounds just about perfect, doesn't it?<br/>
<br/>
Do they have something that's going to let them close that gap and take back the advantage?  Well, they've got their BITs.  If that doesn't do it then ... well ... the Vaylen are a terrible test for any planet.  Some of them fail, and that's a powerful story too.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don't really see a problem, beyond butterflies in the stomach.                        </div>
