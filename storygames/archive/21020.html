I also haven't seen a particular hack which gripped me, though. The World of Algol playbooks are nice, but for a very specific (a la "Barsoom") kind of genre/setting. I think it's just a taste issue, probably - what kind of flavour you're looking for, and whether the playbooks align with that or not.

The name is peculiarly familiar.</blockquote>\nEarly drafts circulated on the Forge about the time I started lurking it - which means, almost exactly 10 years ago. I believe I've played all versions of the game, and what has most changed over versions is the way "magic" is handled - which finally "gelled" into the most literary sword &amp; sorcery subsystem in this s&amp;s game.<br/><br/>Another thing about it which is quintessentially s&amp;s (but not unique to <i>On Mighty Thews</i>) is eschewing character "advancement" completely. Rather, it used to be a rule - but strangely didn't make it into the final version, which is a pity - that when bringing an existing character into a new adventure you can rewrite it completely, as if you were creating the character anew.<br/>This "short story" angle is shared - though maybe with less radical an approach - by most games trying to emulate "literary" swords &amp; sorcery (as opposed to "gamey" or "post-D&amp;D" s&amp;s) that I know of, including <i>Sword &amp; Sorcerer</i>, <i>In a Wicked Age</i> and <i>Swords Without Master</i>. Some of my favorite games amongst those I don't get to play often enough.<br/><br/>An opposite angle - real focus on character advancement of the rags-to-riches fashion, almost an attempt to remake D&amp;D - is found in Vincent's own S&amp;S/planetary romance AW hack <i>Freebooting Venus</i> (available for playtesting). Maybe relevant to the discussion occurring here, Freebooting Venus does away with character-type playbooks (all PCs effectively start with the same playbook, representing a freebooter, or enterprising adventurer). Rather, the game carries a promise to be expanded via a number of additional "modules" (rules + content, not unlike playbooks) following PCs into as many different venues of adventure - such as pursuing wizardry, leading a warband, ruling a city-state, or being dead. These are to be acquired via character advancement, rather than chosen at the onset of play, and unlike AW playbooks they're complementary and cumulative (I suppose one character could well have all of them at the same time) - but they do point almost to different games or at least sub-games being played at the same time, whole different situations to explore, rather than to radically different roles within the same situation and game as in AW.<br/><br/>A final remark that Worlds Without Master has included a different, self-contained game in almost each issue (I possibly have the distinction of having produced the only <i>supplement</i> to a game appearing in a previous issue, really) and these are all "swords and sorcery" games by definition (as it's the magazine's mission statement to perpetrate and possibly update the s&amp;s genre).<br/><br/>EDITED to add: Oh, and there's <i>Nod</i>, from the same author as On Mighty Thews.

If you're interested in fairly simple mechanics designed to lead to satisfying collaborative storytelling, it's pretty great.<br/><br/>The same designer, Epidiah Ravachol, also created Dread, and the recent offshoot <a href="http://www.worldswithoutmaster.com/the-dread-geas-of-duke-vulku" rel="nofollow"><i>The Dread Geas Of Count Vulku</i></a>, which is another game directly inspired by sword-and-sorcery novels, most expressly the work of Clark Ashton Smith and Jack Vance.

References a bunch of obscure, trippy comics.<br/><br/><i>Circle of Hands</i> (Ron Edwards, again): the setting information makes an earnest, possibly the best ever attempt to reconstruct everyday life in a land which historically didn't exist anywhere at any time, but <i>could</i> reasonably have existed at a number of times somewhere.

It's just that they run counter the main line of RPG design tradition, which makes them rare - but every single one I've played worked absolutely fine with regards to, well, being a solo protagonist RPG. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Of the aforementioned s&amp;s-ish games, <i>S/lay w/Me</i>, <i>Nod</i> and my own <i>Enter the Avenger</i> (thanks mentioning it, Paul) are outright solo-protagonist RPGs. <i>S/lay w/Me</i> accomplishes that by being a 2-player game. <i>Nod</i> and <i>EtA</i> are games for 3+ players where one player fills the main character role, while the others play supporting characters, antagonists and the world at large - each player having their own specific tasks.<br/><br/><i>Trollbabe</i>, possibly owing to being an earlier design, chooses an oblique approach - where each trollbabe is essentially the solo protagonist of their own tale, but these stories are told more-or-less simultaneously, with a single GM framing all scenes and alternating between protagonists. Crossing these stories and having the trollbabes meet is optional, and depends on a player choosing to do so, basically by leaving her own story to enter another's.<br/><br/><i>The Clay that Woke</i> is a step from <i>Trollbabe</i>: it has all the individual, single-protagonist stories happen within the same broad geographical area so that they end up being woven together by proximity, with crosses unavoidable. This is actually the solution most common to multiple-protagonist novels (or films): weaving stories together through crosses, with some bigger picture existing but not being immediately apparent. It is also one possible approach to playing <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> or <i>Sorcerer</i>.<br/><br/>A further step is what <i>Sorcerer and Sword</i> basically recommends doing: having all PCs be movers and shakers within some kind of limited scope, but very tense, local situation - not knowing in advance who's gonna to reveal themselves as a hero and who as an antagonist or villain. PCs, then, are more likely to be at odds with each other than work together as a team (this is also how I run Apocalypse World, by the way).<br/><br/><i>In a Wicked Age</i> is similar to the above, but to that it adds specific rules for establishing which character(s) are coming back as recurring main characters. <i>Blood Red Sands</i> does something like that too, in a much more stylized way.<br/><br/><i>On Mighty Thews</i> does have a problem here, as does <i>Swords Without Masters</i>. My best suggestion to preserve the intended s &amp; s feel is: no more than 3 players, including the Master of Ceremonies/Overplayer/GM. This means an adventurous pair of main characters, more in line with the reference genre than any larger group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461433/#Comment_461433" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-26T01:21:46+00:00" title="March 26, 2017  1:21AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see the approach from <i>Clay</i> / <i>Sorcerer and Sword</i> working well for S&amp;S emulation, if we zoom out a bit from the iconic single-protag tale and think more "Worlds of Sword &amp; Sorcery".
