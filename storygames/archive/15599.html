People think the Basic Game is a core rulebook because we have always done the whole "corebook + 2 supps" model in the past. This time around we needed to hook directly into that Marvel Event approach which, regardless of how comic fans think of it, really works well for them. I figure, give it a shot for this, too.<br/><br/>And failing that I would head up a Dragonlance 5e team in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Cam</blockquote>\nI'm intrigued! Tell me more!

This content appears in the Basic Game and in the Premium Edition of each of the Event Books. Event Books are based on popular Marvel crossover events, like Civil War. All heroes and villains provided, multiple paths through the storyline, locations, unlockable resources, campaign stuff. You can buy the Essentials Edition if you already have the Ops Manual from another book. Each Event also has three Event Supplements. These add more stuff to the Event, secondary heroes and villains, more storylines, often peripheral. Sometimes building on the end of the main Event, other times at the same time.<br/><br/>So we have 3 events planned for this year:<br/><br/>Civil War (Premium or Essentials) + 3 Supps<br/>Annihilation (Premium or Essentials) + 3 Supps<br/>Age of Apocalypse (Premium or Essentials) + 3 Supps<br/><br/>Total 15 SKUs, plus Basic Game for 16.<br/><br/>Easy to imagine this being done for D&amp;D-style game. Include rules, characters, campaign in a single book. Eberron, Dragonlance, whatever. No corebook, just rules or no rules as you like.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Cam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353682/#Comment_353682" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T22:57:36+00:00" title="January  9, 2012 10:57PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I am the very model of a modern Marvel RPG<br/>I've battle cries of "Clobbering Time!"

(Some folks have told me Smallville plays quite differently from Cortex.  Dunno if that's true, I've only played Smallville.)<br/><br/>Would you mind elaborating on "multiple paths through the storyline"?<br/><br/>In Age of Apocalypse, can I play Sinister and cleverly con Nate into attacking Magneto, while also selling out Apocalypse to the Europeans and their Sentinels, so everyone else loses and I come out on top?  Or is it, like, this is gonna end with Ilyana and Bishop going into the Mkraan crystal, it's just a matter of how we arrive at that?<br/><br/>I assume that a storyline includes some amount of "And then this thing Happens in the world, with repercussions for the players and all the other factions."  In the core Event books, are such Happenings all taken directly from the comics, or did you make up some new Happenings?  Are the Event Supplements books composed of entirely new Happenings?<br/><br/>I'm asking because I might want to buy the Operations Manual and then an Event Supplement, and skip playing the stuff I've already read.  Would that be an option, or do you need a Event Book in order to be able to use its supplements?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353713/#Comment_353713" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T06:47:46+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  6:47AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>I am the very model of a modern Marvel RPG<br/>I've battle cries of "Clobbering Time!"

It's not a generic super hero game, in other words. That said, in no way do the rules keep you from creating new heroes or events; in fact, the Operations Manual has all of those rules in it because I need people to write those events and create new heroes for our published events. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>One thing that you can do which works very well is take an existing hero, tweak it how you like, add power sets, change Distinctions, and you're set.

He is distinguished by different things, he has different priorities, his life has different key elements to it.  His character sheet will be different.<br/><br/>"Is this what a nervous breakdown looks like for a guy who dresses up like the devil?"<br/><br/>Jean Grey is another example: different creators just have different ideas about who she should be in this particular event.  The main problem with the character comes when we try to assemble all these ideas into a single coherent personality.  It's not possible.  She can't play all those roles, they contradict each other and don't have strong direction, because with multiple creators over 50 years, that would be impossible or boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353885/#Comment_353885" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T07:38:58+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  7:38AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The old Marvel Superheroes Yellow Box was also my "D&amp;D Red Box"! <br/><br/>My first RPG was D&amp;D; I almost never played RPGs ever again!

The Event(meta-plot)structure has zero appeal to me. Simply because Marvel comics from the mid-nineties up until now, has zero appeal to me.  Yes, it makes marketing sense, but it's short-sighted.  What happens after I play through all the Events?  Is there a set-up to craft my own Events?  If so, how many pages is that given?  <br/>How does it handle in-fighting, like classic Kirby/Lee(Defenders)stuff?<br/><br/>I've thought for awhile now, that the Enemy of the Month should be proportionate to the amount of bickering that goes on before they arrived.  The amount of in-fighting creates the Bad Guy they need to unite them.  So, if Johnny and Ben just have a little spat, the Enemy of the Month is gonna be pretty wimpy.  But, if Reed packs up his things and moves out of the Baxter Building, after Sue finds him cheating, the Bad Guy that week will be  a pretty big deal.<br/><br/>I should work on that, or something?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353891/#Comment_353891" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T08:26:33+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  8:26AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He just said there are already rules for creating your own characters in the Operations Manual?

The second time is never as good. Anyway, here goes:<br/><br/>Events are basically "big crossover hoedowns".  This is a technical comics term.  They are definitely finite but definitely longer than one-shots.  I would say that a short Event could be played out in 2-3 sessions and the longest might go 10-11.<br/><br/>I'm giving just the general outline of each event creation step, the text and thoughts are my own tips and ideas for how to make a good event.<br/><br/>1 - Get a basic idea for the Event. Normally you do this by standing on a chair and yelling what the Event is. "SHAPESHIFTING ALIENS INVADE EARTH!!" or "MARY JANE WATSON AND TYPHOID MARY ARE IN THE SAME BROADWAY SHOW!"  Do this until the idea is cool enough or you get kicked out of the restaurant.<br/><br/>2 - Divide the Event into Acts.  It's okay if it's just 1.  If you have more than 3 you probably have 2 Events. Basically Events are Big Developments.  So Act 1 might be "The government Sentinel program is unveiled and it causes big problems for mutants!" and Act 2 might be "The government can't control the Sentinels anymore! OH MAN!"<br/><br/>3 - Organize the flow of each Act.  This is more a bullet point list/skeleton/very broad timeline of what might happen.  So it might be: 1 - The girls get the part, 2 - Spiderman won't leeeeave Typhoiiiiid alooooone, Peter won't leave Mary-Jane alone? 3 - The skeevy producer needs insurance money to pay off the Kingpin, so he sets fire to the theater, 4 - A big showdown with the Kingpin's guys, Typhoid's personalities, Mary Jane, and Spiderman.<br/><br/>4 - Get a Setting, Hook and Buildup for each Act. You probably already did most of this but if you are missing anything, fill it in now.<br/><br/>5 - Sketch out a few Action Scenes.  This is less in terms of outcomes (or even how the scene starts) but more in terms of physical locations, what's at stake other than who wins, etc.  100 ninjas hopped up on mutant growth hormone come to assassinate Matt Murdock while he's on a date with Milla Donovan.<br/><br/>6 - Make sure there's some time for Transition Scenes, and if you have some ideas for them, go ahead and list them, but they're often more player-focused.  A troubled mutant youth comes in between classes to talk to the PC, worried about their future.  A sleazy Kellytown informant gives you the dirt, stuff like that.<br/><br/>7- Make some Event Milestones (possibly) or unlockables (definitely) related to the event.  We have a whole separate thread for Milestones, it's good, go read it. Unlockables are basically what you spend your XP on related to the Event.  Spend 5 XP to get a sympathetic ear at the FBI.  Spend 5 XP and Foggy files a countersuit against the Globe for accusing Matt of being Daredevil.  And so on.  They're basically upgrades/changes/advances for your character that help them out in this event right now.<br/><br/>8 - Sketch out a conclusion. What happens if the heroes win, what happens if the villains win. What are the outcomes of various possibilities going forward for your campaign world?  Sentinels from the future arrive to make sure they aren't wiped out by budget cuts.  Or maybe the government doubles down on the Sentinel program and they become a recurring threat.  Or maybe mutant terrorists cause havoc in response to the Sentinels.  Whatever the "next thing" might be, depending on how things come out.<br/><br/>And that's how you make an Event.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361117/#Comment_361117" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T10:45:26+00:00" title="February 21, 2012 10:45AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's more or less what I put in the Operations Manual, too, Jason, though perhaps without as much whimsey.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Cam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361123/#Comment_361123" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T11:18:27+00:00" title="February 21, 2012 11:18AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, like I say, this is the outline, the details/ideas are my own.

I'm not sure how the business model would work. Free Essentials Event Books to stores that commit to running weekly. Some headache tracking who actually meets the commitment... or do you track sales instead? Maybe. The tricky bit is turning the in-store play into Event Book sales, anyhow: if you're effectively giving away the Event play, people have less of a reason to buy the books and take 'em home. So you'd probably drive Basic Game sales, but that's a one-time sale.<br/><br/>In the ideal world, which is full of free resources, maybe you do a four-week lightweight Event like Breakout during the month before launch of each major Event Book. The lightweight event is a lead-in to the main event (ho ho). Oh, and the incentive to report: the organized play program results unlock big Event stuff, reported via the MW web site? Something like that... oh, no, they unlock free additional character dossiers. It's like Kickstarter. And you recycle the dossiers from the previous Events, so that lowers the cost of production plus it provides a free teaser for people who haven't yet bought previous Event Books. <br/><br/>Unfortunately I imagine that actually producing an extra three Events per year is impractical for a number of reasons, perhaps including licensing agreements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361987/#Comment_361987" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T18:50:56+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  6:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sooo...no hero creation rules?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361990/#Comment_361990" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T18:58:31+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  6:58PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 6:59PM by Skywalker.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>Sooo...no hero creation rules?</blockquote>\nThe process for creating Heroes is outlined on 3 pages with the full details taking up 58 pages of the book. So, no hero creation rules is inaccurate.<br/><br/>What you may been referring to is that there is no point buy system for Powers or Skills. Instead, you choose various effects (from numerous examples and lengthy guidelines) based on concept. <br/><br/>This allows for a lot of freedom of creativity and the system somewhat balances the power level through the use of Plot Points, multiple stats applying to any one roll and the narrow power scale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
