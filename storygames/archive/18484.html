If I get chance I'll whip up a pdf of the result for you.<br/><br/>The framing device is that a fantasy assassin's guild has a problem: one of their targets refuses to die, after a number of attempts, so they call in a specialist to deal with it.<br/><br/>One player takes the role of the specialist, their job is to direct play by asking questions in the first act, assigning tasks in the discussion phase and framing scenes in the second act.<br/><br/>The remaining players take on the primary roles of members of the guild,  they frame scenes and take on parts in the first act, participate and backstab in the discussion phase and decide the outcomes in the second act.<br/><br/>The game would proceed as follows:<br/>Players decide on the specialist, who decides an underlying common strand for the game from a list, then selects a few character details.<br/>The rest of the players take different specialties, then make choices to refine them and describe their character.<br/>There is now an introductions scene. Then the specialist uses a key phrase to start act one, in which each player nominates someone to play their character and narrates how their previous assassination attempt failed. Other players can jump in to play needed roles, or add to the scene. Throughout the specialist asks the narrator questions.<br/>Then follows the discussion, where the evidence is reviewed and each player is given a task by the specialist, of a damage control, stage-setting or fact finding nature. At the beginning of this act each player places a card in front of each other player, based on how they think the task should go, for this I'm thinking personal danger and safety or mission success or failure.<br/>Not sure what to do for the climax, though.<br/><br/>What do you think? Decent idea?<br/>Could the cards be used in act one?<br/>How many options should each character have?<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Mr Purple                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
