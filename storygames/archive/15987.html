As such I'm under constant pressure to keep coming up with new and interesting things to write about so people will pay me money and I can eat.  I'm also (kind of) a roleplayer \u2014 see <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15810" rel="nofollow">a recent thread</a> about my current gaming status, if you're interested \u2014 and in both cases I'm always looking for shortcuts to creativity.  I'm inherently lazy, so anything that lifts the burden of creation even partially from my shoulders is very welcome.<br/><br/>So anyway, a few years back I found a <a href="http://www.braineater.com/misc/giallo.html" rel="nofollow">random plot generator</a> out of which I've actually managed to get some solid premises.  It's meant kind of as a joke, as it takes the plot elements of Italian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giallo" rel="nofollow">giallo</a> films and mixes them up in odd ways to produce phony <i>gialli</i>, complete with incomprehensible English titles, that you can claim are totally real the next time some film geek is showing off his/her encyclopedic genre knowledge.  Sometimes the results are completely unworkable and sometimes they're close to brilliant.  I actually have one project I'm going to write based strictly on what popped up on the screen.  It was too good not to do something with.<br/><br/>What works for writing works for gaming, too.  We call them <i>story games</i>, after all.  It seems like this <i>giallo</i> generator could be the source of some good, twisted fun.  But paired with what system?  Ideally it would be one that allows for mind-games between GM and players (or between players and players) because <i>giallo</i> are not just bloody, sexy thrillers, but psychological brain-twisters featuring perverse motives and outrageous clues.<br/><br/>I thought maybe GUMSHOE might work \u2014 <i>Fear Itself</i>, maybe? \u2014 because of the mystery elements and the insanity mechanic, but if someone else has a better idea, lay it on me.  Oh, and share if you get a particularly tasty random result from the generator.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363930/#Comment_363930" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T12:59:34+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 12:59PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't help but to think that somewhere in there is an interesting way to incorporate a back-and-forth between the generator and the player to develop the story. So, I'll try hitting reload until I get some information that relates to the thing I'm asking about (paraphrasing):<br/><br/>"A blind girl is butchered in the style of a killer who terrorized the neighborhood several hundred years ago."<br/><br/>Hmmm, okay, I'll go do some research into the neighborhood...get some data on the killer from a hundred years ago.<br/><br/>You meet a young nanny, who has inadvertently picked up a piece of evidence."<br/><br/>Evidence?? Show me!<br/><br/>"The violin bow, it's covered with dry blood."<br/><br/>Interesting, where did you get this.<br/><br/>"The young nanny accidentally destroys the violin bow."<br/><br/>What, are you daft, you young nanny, you! can you show me where you at least found it?<br/><br/>"The river."<br/><br/>I'll go check out the river then,, thanks!<br/><br/>"An elderly journalist who has disappeared, is found dead in the river!"<br/><br/>Cripes! Another victim. Is there anyone else around?<br/><br/>"An aging female journalist, who is unsatified with the official explanations."<br/><br/>Okay, you probably knew this guy. What do you know about what's going on? Why don't you trust the police's story?<br/><br/>"After decoding the entries in a hidden journal, the crimes turn out to have been a hoax!"<br/><br/>What! How do you know this? What are the crimes really about?<br/><br/>"The first victim, is actually the killer, and is still on the loose!"<br/><br/>Oh great. So the blind girl is faking everything?<br/><br/>"I've been using this knowledge to force the maniac into an increasingly dangerous sexual power game..."<br/><br/>Hmmm, interesting. We should put a stop to the blind girl killer then! Where is she!<br/><br/>"We find the blind girl, drenched in blood under a bridge."<br/><br/>Okay, I'm going to be a hero and put an end to this madness. I try to take her down.<br/><br/>"Later, the blind girl is found dead under the bridge. I find myself implicated deeper and deeper in the crimes, with no apparent way out."<br/><br/>FIN                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/reaction" title="reaction"><img alt="reaction" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/reaction">reaction</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363949/#Comment_363949" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T13:22:39+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  1:22PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait... what the hell, Sam?

That road takes them to the next clue / event and so on.<br/><br/>So far I've got a card randomizer that gives out a list of 4 words and one phrase per card. You get to use only one of the words or the phrase. You can use a combination of any number of cards to get keywords to frame an scene. And the more cards used, the more complex the mistery or the more challenging is the scene. Players then get to use a combination of their skills, cards of their own, conections and other as resources to spend in order to solve the mistery / beat the challenge.<br/><br/>Does anybody know of a game that works like this? I've been cheking the GUMSHOE system, but it doesn't do what I thought it would.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
