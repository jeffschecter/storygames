Like, once when trying to intimidate and bluff my way past a DB patrol I did this thing where I had the party dress up with tiger skulls on their heads, and then announced at the gate that we were "the five devil-tigers of Nat Lum" and said that the devil tigers were the most feared bounty hunters in the south. I get my stunt bonus, and everyone thinks that is cool, and likes this "devil-tiger" business and asks me where "Nat Lum" is. I shrug, cause I have no damn clue.  <br/><br/>The GM makes a note on his sheet at this point. About two games later, guess who we run into on the road? Why yes, the five devil-tigers. While fighting them one of the other players uses a stunt in which he describes beating the second devil-tiger with the "lost swallow strike of KenSu." He gets his stunt bonus, we ask who Ken Su is and he shrugs, cause he has no clue. <br/><br/>The GM makes a note on his sheet at this point. About two games later, we roll up into Nat Lum, where Ken Su is in a death match with the local small god cults. Our boy goes off to help Ken Su, who he used to train with he says, while we go to deliver the Devil Tiger's scalps to their Death Lord master. <br/><br/>The cool thing about this was that in order to get bonuses in combats and conflicts, we started making up random and cool sounding bits of setting. They usually tied to something -- bounty hunters, famous swordsmen, cities of sorcerers, whatever -- and then those things would come into the game later. In a real way we kinda made up the specifics of the setting through our stunts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129858/#Comment_129858" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T17:30:40+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  5:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Naruto Flash-Backs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
