It's not even a Kickstarter for a novel exactly. It\u2019s more like a Kickstarter for an ideal and the novel is the vehicle.<br/><br/>Let me explain as short as I can. We\u2019re kind of high-minded and complicated.<br/><br/>I work for the Consortium, a non-profit arts organization in Oklahoma City. I\u2019m their marketing director but I\u2019m also one of their published authors. Our basic tenets can be boiled down to 1) artists are important enough that they deserve a living wage to create art, 2) we can finance those wages via a new patronage model, 3) copyright is evil, but 4) if you pay artists that decent wage, they don\u2019t have to worry about exploiting their copyright.<br/><br/>We feel like 4 handles 3 and, in the meantime, we work towards 1 and 2 while injecting as much art as humanly possible into the public domain. It\u2019s very important to us that our works become available for others to borrow from, copy, recreate, recombine, and generally learn with and from.<br/>The ideal is that I, as an artist, receive a salary so everything I create finds immediate release into the public domain. This is financed partially by sales of the art (e-books, physical books, original art, prints, music downloads, whatever). But our primary funding will be through what we call a new patronage. <br/><br/>This is a smart community; I don\u2019t have to explain patronage to you. But the difference between old patronage and new patronage is things like Kickstarter. We don\u2019t have to rely on nobles and the rich when we can pool our money in other ways.<br/><br/>At any rate, we aren\u2019t quite to that ideal yet. Right now, our artists are volunteers and donate their work to the Consortium so the organization can do the release into the public domain. But we are easily two or three years ahead of our schedule, and this Kickstarter\u2019s success would probably move us that far ahead again.<br/><br/>The big explanation of why a new patronage is so necessary to art and why copyright is evil is available in the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/consortiumokc/help-release-the-dragonprinces-heir" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a> description. I\u2019m trying to keep this relatively short, so if you have questions, check that out. If you still have questions, put them here or whisper to me and I\u2019ll do my best to answer them.<br/><br/>I\u2019m linking this here at all because this is a community who cares about Art. Because of that, some of you may come to care about the Consortium. Thanks for taking a look.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
