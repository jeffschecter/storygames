                    I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/11/05/crowdfunding-collection-87/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 87, including every tabletop project started between 10/22 till 11/04.</a></b><br/><br/>November has seen the start for an staggering amount of fresh projects, 70 in total and no less than 20 new, english RPG games.<br/><br/>Amon all those projects I backed no less than seven and got quite some more starred.<br/>One of the first I backed and would like to recommend was <b>Nahual</b>. I followed its development since the creators worked on it on Patreon and am fascinated by the Urban Fantasy with a distinct Mexican touch. Well, and I do still fancy powered by the apocalypse games. Then there is <b>Kamigakari – God Hunters</b>, a translation of an Japanese RPG. Which offers cool artworks, promises interesting action in an Urban Fantasy setting and the system looks solid. <b>Thousand Arrows</b> does as well put its focus on Japan and Asia, though more from a historic to fantasy point of view. Considering its done with PbtA I couldn’t resist.<br/><b>Thousand Year Old Vampire</b> had me pretty much at „Vampire“. Though I am as well intruiged by the solo-gaming approach and by the fact that one gets to play their Vampire for a thousand years. Making it a „must back“ next to my buzzword. <b>Never Going Home</b> addresses the horrors of World War I and does mix in some cthulhoid horror. While the Cthulhu factor wasn’t exactly a selling point for me, the presentation convinced me that its done in taste and quite fascinating. Thus I pledged for it. <b>Four Ways to Die in the Future</b> focuses on death and the finality of life in a very serious, earnest approach. The four games are interesting, even though I do consider at least one is to intense for my liking. Yet the other games and the way how the topic is approach, that it is approached, makes it a „must pledge“ for me.I do recommend all the games I pledges to whole heartily.<br/>Next to those I backed <b>Chicago By Night – for Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition</b> which isn’t a game but a source book for V5. I am a massive fan of Vampire, I do enjoy the 5th Edition and just ran about 14 to 16 games during SPIEL. Thus I eyed this project it so closely that I managed to be back number 2. The book does not only offer some metaplot advancement, provides the city of Chicago as a playground with many story hooks but will introduce the Lasombra as a playable clan. The first two stretch goals included some really interesting expansion of the folios and the fourth stretch goal does enhance the book as well. Plus the books will be available in regular retail! I am super hyped and do hope that you might consider it too.<br/>Among the projects which I almost backed is <b>After the End</b>. A French game that offers a fascinating mis of boardgame elements, standing campaign play and role-playing. I spoke with the creators (during SPIEL) and was quite fascinated. <b>Die Laughing</b> by Craig Campbell is a little, charming horror rpg. Considering the creator did good things with Capers I do recommend taking a look. Another interesting game is <b>Black Iron</b>.<br/>I’d like to (very) briefly address the German projects. <b>So nicht, Schurke!</b> is the translation of „No Thank you, Evil!“ which I would have backed, if I have had kids. <b>Fallen Worlds</b> is a small SF/endtime games. While <b>Hexenjagd</b> offers a supplement for HeXXen 1733.<br/><br/>You’ll find plenty more, cool, engaging games, supplements, adventures and rather unique to weird stuff (socks!),… just have a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Urban Fantasy (Modern) Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Urban Fantasy (History) Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Horror Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Science Fiction Role-Playing Games<br/>3 GM-less Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Kid-Friendly Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Multi-Setting Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Gamebook<br/>3 LARP Projects<br/>3 Supplements<br/>3 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>1 Setting<br/>3 Adventures<br/>2 D&amp;D 5E Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>3 Coin/Token Projects<br/>2 Dice Accessoires<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>3 Map &amp; Tile Projects<br/>4 Various RPG Projects<br/>4 Other Games<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Supplement<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Supplement<br/>1 Dice Project<br/>1 Magazine<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Adventure<br/><br/>Blog Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/11/05/crowdfunding-collection-87/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/11/05/crowdfunding-collection-87/</a> </div>

Damn! Kickstarter-rpg-culture is still going strong! I haven't looked at it in a while; I would not have expected so many new games to still be coming out month after month. Who's playing all of these games?!<br/> </div>

                            Usually, my expectation for two weeks would be around 40 to 50 projects with maybe 10 new games.<br/>The influx of new projects in November is related to the end of the fiscal year for US creators and the SPIEL trade-fair event for European creators.<br/><br/>As for who plays those games. My guess is gamers who like the systems used in the game, gamers who are interested in the often niché topics of the game, gamers who suddenly discover games that talk about their world and in which they feel represented, gamers who are curious, excitable and interested in new games,..<br/><br/>Like, I am prone to back stuff that uses the PbtA engine, I do like to back stuff that comes from different backgrounds than the euro-centric or USA-centric standard, I do like games that offer an interesting new approach to things or address uncommon topics, I do will back anything with enthusiasm that's V:tM related or adjenct.. and I am quite excitable in general ^^<br/>That's how I ended up backing 7 projects and currently ogling "Seed of Wars" (a realm management supplement).                        </div>

You’ll find impressive looking gaming table with the <b>HÜNE Spieltisch</b> and D&amp;D 5E miniatures and cards with <b>Canitaurs &amp; Felitaurs</b>.<br/><br/>The section of new role-playing games host an astounding amount of fresh science fiction or at least syfy projects. Thus one can play a space faring scoundrel in <b>Never Tell Me The Odds</b>, explore an AI and discover yourself in the more transhumanist game <b>Become</b> and experience memetic horror with <b>After The War</b>. Then there is <b>Mutant: Elysium</b> creating another entry to the Mutant: Year Zero series, where I am personally are more inclined to wait for the German translation. <b>FlipTales</b> offers an interesting, little Fantasy RPG well suited for kids. Well and <b>Rockopolis</b> offers to get into the Kickstarter late via the means of IndieGoGo.<br/>Amongst the settings I found <b>Crystal Heart</b> for Savage Worlds endearing. It offers a colorful setting, with superpowered characters who are inflicted with maybe just a speck of insanity..<br/>The most interesting supplements for me were <b>Wyrd of Stromgard</b>, which builds upon Dungeon World and <b>Occult Philosophy</b> that massively extends the setting of Shadow of the Demonlord..<br/>You’ll find many, many more cool games, books, dice and other projects.
