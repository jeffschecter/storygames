Got a burst of interest in the idea of Dopplegangers after something my bro said, so I wrote an ApW-style shapeshift move. After a little more thought, I decided I could totally write a skin based off of it for Monsterhearts, so I took a quick break from Avatar World to, uh, do so.<br/><br/>While I came up with the original idea based on the monster itself, the design really came out of the teenager-archetype/metaphor idea of it. The Doppleganger is jealousy and self-loathing and wanting to be everyone else, seeing all the others things people have and how they don't have the flaws you have and how things could be better if you cold be like them. It's combined with the same sort of hero worship a lot of teens express, and the sort of admiration that creates successful people. The sort of people whose default nature is like that of The Queen's clique would make good Dopplegangers.<br/>It's also about not liking yourself as you are, obsessing over your flaws and trying to get rid of them. Dopplegangers have low self-esteem, low self-confidence, low self-image, low self-everything.<br/><br/>I wasn't totally this guy in high school, but I certainly had elements of it. The other main reason I fully fleshed this out beyond just a couple moves is because my group is starting Monsterhearts in a couple weeks and I really really want to play this guy.<br/><br/>Stuff in quotes is game text, with bracketed indicators for stuff I specifically talk about after the quote. Usually it's stuff I want some feedback on, whether it's a simple "does  it read" clarification or something more balance-based.\n<blockquote>The Doppleganger<br/>Description: All those people seem so special. They have their icy glares, their smoldering good looks, their razor-sharp intellect. You don't have any of that, and you wanted it. Then you discovered you could become them, and suddenly, it was all within your grasp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Stats: Add 1 to one of these: Hot -1, Cold -1, Volatile +1, Dark +1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Look: Pick one from each list.<br/>* Paper-white skin, Boring and average, Unappealing, Inconspicuous<br/>* Empty Eyes, Prying Eyes, Jealous Eyes, Distant Eyes, Harmless Eyes, Brooding Eyes</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Origin: Rich and neglected, orphan, smothering and overbearing parents, depressed, delusional</blockquote>\nI'm not having a great time with these. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br/>Also I have NO names, any ideas for that?\n<blockquote>Backstory: * You've been impersonating someone recently. Who, and what sympathetic token do you have on them? Gain an additional string on them on top of that.<br/>* Someone caught you while reverting to your own form once. They get two strings on you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Advancement:<br/>* Add 1 to Hot (max+3)<br/>* Add 1 to Cold (max+3)<br/>* Add 1 to Volatile (max+3)<br/>* Add 1 to Dark (max+3)<br/>* Take another Doppelganger move.<br/>* Take another Doppelganger move.<br/>* Take a move from another skin.<br/>* Take a move from another skin.<br/>* You belong to a Shapeshifter Cult[!]</blockquote>\n[!] I dunno, I just made something up. Any ideas for something that might actually be relevant? Or that might replace it, cuz I don't <i>really</i> see Dopplegangers as a very social sort of monster, or at least the sort that wouldn't be interested in being with others of its kind.\n<blockquote>MOVES:<br/>You begin with Transform and one other move.<br/>Transform: "When you use a sympathetic token[!] to take someone's form[!!], roll+Dark[!!!]. On a 10+, you've got it just right. On a 7-9, choose one: <br/>* The disguise doesn't hold up under scrutiny[!!!!],<br/>* Assuming the disguise is an agonizing process, take 1 Harm[!!!!!], <br/>* The disguise won't last long. <br/>On a 6-, the MC chooses any or all of the above and makes a hard move."</blockquote>\n[!] Two things. One, I'm not positive I want to require a sympathetic token at all. The other thing is how to establish the wording. I could reproduce the Witch move, but that seems weird to me. Might do it anyway though.<br/>[!!] Confirming: It's got to be someone. You can't take generic shapes, you need to try to be another specific person.<br/>[!!!] I've been debating about what exactly this move is stat-wise, and I think in the end Dark is the best. I considered Hot, since this is very much about appearances and all, but the Doppelganger ISN'T hot until they take a form.<br/>[!!!!] Close scrutiny. What exactly is wrong is essentially up the MC's final approval - maybe you don't know until it comes up. It might not even be physical, it could be that you've gotten a fundamental part of their personality wrong in your impersonation.<br/>[!!!!!] I'm touchy about this one, but I like the general idea. <br/>As a side note, this is also the move you roll "When you ingest Polyjuice Potion...".\n<blockquote>Walk Like You, Talk Like You: "While you're disguised as another PC, when you make a move, use their stats instead of your own."</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Impressionable Personality: "When you return to your original form after being disguised as another PC, you temporarily change one of your stats to their value for that stat. This alteration goes away when you next transform.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Crawl Inside Your Head: "When you spend time and intimacy with someone, it counts as taking a sympathetic token on them."</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Your Evil Twin: "When someone is blamed for something you did in their form, mark experience[!]."</blockquote>\n[!] I debated what the reward should be for this; my main options were Strings and XP. I could reason how strings could make sense logically, and XP is a bit more significant, but I think it's worth it - it takes some real work, and some rolls, to set this sort of thing up.<br/><br/>I could probably use another move if I don't include the Witch's Sympathetic Tokens move, and even if I do I have room for another. Any ideas? I'm pretty much spent for the moment, though inspiration may strike again.\n<blockquote>Darkest Self: "You despise yourself. All these other pretty people have everything you've ever wanted but could never have for yourself. In fact, no one would even notice if you were just...gone. Just be someone else - ALL the time. And if you need to get the "real" them out of the way to pull it off, so be it. Escape your Darkest Self when you accept your flaws[!] and voluntarily return to your own form."</blockquote>\nIn essence this is: you don't just want to BE them - you want to REPLACE them.<br/>[!] This is logically sensible but may be asking too much of a character whose whole gimmick is about hating his flaws and wishing he was a person without them.\n<blockquote>Sex Move: "When you have sex with another character, you must Hold Steady or return to your original form immediately afterward."</blockquote>\nI'm excited about this. I don't even know if you deserve a roll if you're having sex in an assumed form, but sure, have one.<br/>Side note that DOES make me a little uncomfortable: Pretty sure tricking them into thinking they're having sex with a different person might be a little close to the rape line. I 100% believe that's a thing a misguided and depressed teenage doppleganger would do, but that doesn't mean it's a bit bothersome to my mind.<br/><br/>So, that's what I have. There's four very specific things I'd really love some feedback on:<br/>1) Names List Ideas<br/>2) Origins<br/>3) A Potential Additional Move<br/>4) How you might visually represent a Doppleganger while also making their image noticeably human. I tried a couple of art ideas and none of them have worked out so far.<br/>Thanks in advance for any help!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405108/#Comment_405108" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-31T09:10:44+00:00" title="January 31, 2013  9:10AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2013 10:32AM by Cneph.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!

Ideas all over the place.<br/>First and foremost:\n<blockquote>"When you take the form of someone whose mannerisms and habits you've studied closely..."<br/>"When you have sex with another character it counts as studying their mannerisms and habits closely. You can take their form at will, but always as if you rolled a 7-9."</blockquote>\nYES. That would be my missing link. Exactly what I needed to make Transform work exactly how I want.<br/>The sex move is pretty great too. I still like the idea of it being problematic to have sex in assumed forms, but this is probably a more useful thing. I can see it doing interesting things too - gonna think on this.<br/>But the studying closely bit? Yup. That's what I wanted.<br/><br/>Other cool things:<br/>Taking places with Advancements is a hugely cool thing for an advancement. Got a few options now for how to word it/who it replaces, so now I just need to figure out how to write it how I want.<br/>Taking the place of literally a previous character rather than just their Skin is a cool idea.<br/>On the topic of shattering character-ownership barriers, yeah, this guy does that all over the place.There was almost a move that had you using other people's Strings (cashing in their favors) but that was a bit crossing the line for ownership. I wasn't exactly attached to that bit anyway though.<br/>Names! Thanks so much for these, definitely jump-started my thoughts.<br/>"A gender-neatural name, a boring [or unassuming] name, a common name". I'll pick a bunch from that batch zircher posted cuz I like those (thanks!) and add in some John, Tommy, Michael, Sarah, Emily, Jennifer into the mix.<br/>Copying playbook moves temporarily will likely be the sixth move since I don't need to describe Sympathetic Tokens. So the things are basically: "Transform" to look like them, "Walk Like You, Talk Like You" to be as proficient as them, "Be Like You" to have their special skills but not necessarily be as good as them.<br/>That Darkest Self escape clause that Michael mentioned is a good thing and I like it. I'm going to be going with a slight variation of it I think, and I'll post what that is when I've got a wording worked out.<br/><br/>A revised move:<br/>Impressionable Personality: "When you return to your original form after being disguised as another PC, note which of their stats had been highest and lowest. Until you next Transform, increase the stat that had been their highest by one (to a maximum of +3), and decrease the stat that had been their lowest by one. If you had been copying an NPC, the MC will tell you which stats to alter."<br/>This is an awkwardly worded enhancement of the previous Impressionable Personality, so now you're being changed by what they were like rather than by what you want to keep, which I think is more like what I was going for. My friend, and the MC for my upcoming Monsterhearts game, suggested this one.<br/>Also it's a pretty decent way of having their skills bleeding into your natural form again once you've transformed back. Could do it with a Condition type thing, but can't come up with a compelling wording off the top of my head.<br/><br/>Again, thanks for the kinda words and all the help, folks!

Hopefully its formatting works... Would still love an art idea on top of any additional feedback! Two posts long.\n<blockquote>Description: You idolized them, their icy glares, their smoldering looks, their razor intellect. You tried to act like them, pretended to be like them. Then you started to become them. Now nothing of it is outside your grasp if you simply find the right role-model.</blockquote>\nTrying to get something a little pithier than before, a little bit more dramatic when read at the table, something that says "Wow, I Want To Play That!" Not sure if I'm there yet, but I think this is better.\n<blockquote>Stats: Add 1 to one of these: Hot -1, Cold -1, Volatile +1, Dark +1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Name List: Cameron, Chris, Emily, Harley, Jennifer, John, Michael, Sarah, Stacy, Taylor, Tommy<br/>An unassuming name, a gender-neutral name, a plain name, a common name</blockquote>\n(by some fortune, none of that name list already exists in the official skins!)<br/>Big thanks to zircher and Michael, needed those ideas to make this work.\n<blockquote>Look: Pick one from each list.<br/>* Paper-white skin, Boring and average, Unappealing, Inconspicuous<br/>* Empty Eyes, Prying Eyes, Jealous Eyes, Distant Eyes, Harmless Eyes, Brooding Eyes</blockquote>\nKinda feel like I ought to have one more on the top list, but not sure what it would be.\n<blockquote>Origin: Rich and neglected, orphan, smothering and overbearing parents, depressed, delusional</blockquote>\nStill struggling here.\n<blockquote>Backstory: * You've been impersonating someone recently. Who? Gain a string on them.<br/>* Someone caught you while reverting to your own form once. They get two strings on you.</blockquote>\nFundamentally unchanged, though without reference to Sympathetic Tokens.\n<blockquote>Advancement:<br/>* Add 1 to Hot (max+3)<br/>* Add 1 to Cold (max+3)<br/>* Add 1 to Volatile (max+3)<br/>* Add 1 to Dark (max+3)<br/>* Take another Doppelganger move.<br/>* Take another Doppelganger move.<br/>* Take a move from another skin.<br/>* Take a move from another skin.<br/>* Memorize a person's form.

Take the discarded Skin sheet and just start using it, with their stats and selected moves and remaining Strings and all. You can no longer Transform.</blockquote>\nI included both Paul's basic idea from memorizing a form (and memorizing an NPC's form is certainly permissable!) and Cneph's golden "assume dead PC's form" one. Like he said, this is hella dangerous to the game if you don't trust each other. This Skin is already about smashing character-ownership barriers, and this is the final step to completely own someone else's previous character. If you killed them to take their character? You should probably talk that out. It 100% makes sense if you're Darkest Self though. This is really the final goal of pretty much ALL Dopplegangers (as characters - as players we have other goals).<br/>I won't be picking this right away when I play him. I want to explore being a Doppleganger. If anyone else chooses to play this fella though, and eventually picks this, PLEASE let me know how that goes, I'm super-interested in stories about that.\n<blockquote>Transform: "When you take the form of someone whose mannerisms and habits you've studied closely, roll+Dark. On a 10+, you've got it just right and can stay that way as long as you desire. On a 7-9, choose one:<br/>* Your impersonation doesn't hold up under scrutiny,<br/>* Assuming the disguise is an agonizing process. Take 1 Harm,<br/>* The disguise won't last very long.<br/>On a 6-, the MC chooses any or all of the above and makes a hard move."</blockquote>\nFor the "scrutiny" 7-9 option I decided to go with Impersonation, since it can apply either to your physical shape messing up or it can apply to your behavior not matching very well. Thanks again to noclue for the "studied closely" bits of the trigger, it's perfect.\n<blockquote>Walk Like You, Talk Like You: "While you're disguised as another PC, use their stats instead of your own."</blockquote>\nYanked the reference to "when you make a move" since it's not really necessary.<br/>Should this be only PCs, and not NPCs? I know NPCs don't have stats so that could be a big hassle, but I feel like it might be a little under-used if it's PC-only. Then again, if you don't do a lot of copying the other PCs, just don't take this move - Impressionable Personality is probably more up your alley.\n<blockquote>Learn From You: When you return to your original form, alter your stats based upon the stats of the form you just changed back from. Whichever stat they had highest, increase your own stat by 1 (to a maximum of +3). Whichever they had lowest, decrease your own stat by 1. If you had been copying an NPC, the MC will tell you which stats to change.<br/>These alterations go away when you next Transform.</blockquote>\nI'm having a crazy time with the name here. Nothing is really sticking to me.\n<blockquote>Crawl Inside Your Head: "When you spend time and intimacy with someone, it counts as closely studying their mannerisms and habits. From then on, whenever you assume their form you may ask one question of the other character's player. It needn't be something you could reasonably know, and they have to answer completely and honestly."</blockquote>\nThis might have been a bit redundant with the new studying bit until I added the question. That is DEFINITELY crawling inside their head. I love love love it, this one is now with the others (Transform, WLY,TLY, Learn, Evil Twin) on the list of "I can't wait to take this move."\n<blockquote>Your Evil Twin: "When someone is blamed for something you did in their form, mark experience."</blockquote>\nNo changes at all! Very happy with this.<br/><br/>(cont. next post)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405443/#Comment_405443" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T03:01:15+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  3:01AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cont. from prev post)\n<blockquote>Be Like You: "When you assume the form of another PC, pick one of the moves they've taken. Until you drop the disguise, you can use this move as if you'd taken it. Spend Strings on them to select additional moves on a 1-for-1 basis. You lose these moves when you return to your own form."</blockquote>\nThis is heavily inspired from Cneph's suggestion, but I've had a thought to access their moves since the beginning. I'd held \toff on it before because I feared that it could snap the niche protection of the game a little bit to give a second person the ability to do the unique things they can do. I hadn't known about The Hollow's Mimicry move, and seeing that there was \talready established "do their tricks" move gave enough confidence to make it happen.<br/>Speaking of Mimicry, I should point out why the drawback of Mimicry ain't around. Mimicry has two problems: the move has to be used on you (ruling out the passive moves), and you only get to use it once. I've removed both of these. The \trequirement of studying is a rebalance to having to be targeted (since you have to take time and effort), and while the Hollow has as long as they want to take advantage of the move that one time, you can only hold it until you turn back. \tAdditionally, unlike the Hollow, there's no way to permanently take the move.<br/>Cneph's example wasn't quite sure if Strings were the right currency. I bumped against this for a bit - I like for spending Strings to have a fictional effect as well, not just being treated as currency. However, this doesn't quite line up to a "exerting your control over them" circumstance. My justification I eventually reached is that when you take even more of them into you, you become less willing to hold things over them. You're trying to BE them, you don't want to change how they are - that would defeat the purpose! The more you take in of them, the more you become them, the less will you \thave to change what they're like.<br/>There are some moves that you likely would NOT take from your new form. The first one to come to mind? The Ghoul's Hunger. However, I encourage taking even moves that aren't totally helpful if it makes sense that that's what The Doppleganger wants to feel. Plus, most of those ones have other moves that bounce off of them for benefits if you can take \tadvantage of them - for example, you can spend a String to have Satiety and The Hunger, and THAT'S a pretty decent combo.<br/>There WILL be weird cases that you need to resolve on your own. If you take some Sympathetic Tokens from people while being The Witch, chances are you still have those when you change back. In fact, Sympathetic Tokens is a little weird with \t\ttransformation in general - if you're transformed as The Werewolf and The Witch takes some of your hair and later hexes with it, does it target The Doppleganger or The Werewolf? I'd probably say The Werewolf, but that's a judgment call. Just wanted to point out how weird this can be sometimes.<br/>Excited to try this move. I hope there's a Ghoul with Short Rest For The Wicked around, I'd love to have that.\n<blockquote>Linked: "While in the form of another character, you both know and experience the emotions of the other, though you cannot necessarily distinguish those emotions as being from a foreign source. When either of you allow those emotions to influence your actions, take a String on the other character."</blockquote>\nThis is a psychic link, obviously. The idea just kinda came to me, and I like it enough to include (and since I don't need \tTokens, I have a spare move slot!). It's got all kinds of fun possibilities in there!<br/>Chances are, the Doppleganger can tell which emotions aren't purely his, and he DEFINITELY knows where the other side \tof the emotions is coming from. The other guys likely doesn't know either of these, but his player does, so just go with it.<br/>Like I just said, I like String uses to represent actually fictional things as well as being mechanical currency. In this case, it's pretty easy: you know what they're feeling. You don't necessarily know who those feelings are coming from, but you know how someone is feeling, and that gives a bit of leverage over them.\n<blockquote>Darkest Self: "You despise yourself. All these other pretty people have everything you've ever wanted but could never have for yourself. In fact, no one would even notice if you were just...gone. Just be someone else - ALL the time. And if you need to get the "real" them out of the way to pull it off, so be it. Escape your Darkest Self when someone calls you on not being who you say you are."</blockquote>\nThe escape is a variation on m_busuttil's idea of "when someone else sees you for who you really are." I like that, but I find \tit hard to imagine any characters actually being able to tell who exactly is under the disguise. Instead, this is a bit easier than that - they need to discover that you're an imposter of some kind, but don't need your actual identity. However, it's not quite as easy as just seeing it - they have to CONFRONT you about it. They have to push it past "Hey man, you okay? You \thaven't seemed like yourself lately." They need to call you on having changed, of being different than you actually are, and \tinsisting that something is different.<br/>I think this works great on several levels. First, it's hard but not impossible. Calling people on stuff like that? Hard to do. Second, while it makes sense that it spooks the Doppleganger into abandoning the obsession out of fear of being caught, it also cracks their shell of false confidence - they were perfect, and you WERE them, but you were still different. Your self-doubt about inhabiting other forms is back, and you're back to your regular transforming self.<br/>Something I'm still not sure is communicated is that I intend for you to take and keep a SINGLE form. I think it currently might read as ambiguous whether I'm directing the Darkest Self to be one other person all the time, or to just not be your true form ever. I'm intending the former, but I guess I'm not opposed to the other as well, so read it how you will I guess.\n<blockquote>Sex Move: "When you have sex with another character, it counts as studying them closely. You can assume their form at will, but it always counts as if you'd rolled a 7-9. If you are transformed, Hold Steady or  return to your original form immediately afterward."</blockquote>\nBasically, this is my own idea directly slammed together with noclue's. Pretty much literally.  That doesn't mean I don't think it's gold. This is one of the things I am super excited to experience when I play him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405462/#Comment_405462" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T07:29:16+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  7:29AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the rewrite a great deal, and doing a double-effect (both good and bad) on the sex move doesn't bother me (I like it, in fact).<br/><br/>It also inspired me with an idea for an effect.

Some quick things:<br/>One more Look: Forgettable<br/>Skins all seem to have 9 advancement options.  For this one, I'd either drop one 'take a move from another Skin' advance (as they have other options here), or maybe figure something more radical for Stat advances, related to taking on another Skins' stats.<br/><br/>I think you are missing out on using a useful Monsterhearts piece of tech by not using Conditions as part of the costs and choices the Skin has to make.  Maybe one appropriate under Linked in some circumstances, to represent the upsetting nature of of the emotional bleed?  Although the MC could just call for Hold Steady when appropriate.  I do think Conditions could be used to good effect in the Skin moves.<br/><br/>Balance wise, the new Be Like You is much stronger than the Hollow move.  You get to choose the move you want, you get to pick multiple moves, and you are able to use them over and over at no further cost.  The drawback of requiring study is really the Transform moves' drawback.  This has no downside- you can even selectively avoid their 'bad' moves, being better than the other Skin.<br/><br/>If I were evaluating the Skin for my table and cared to consider balance, I'd say the move is too much as written.  If you intend keeping reusable moves, drop the option to take additional moves.  There should be some downside to taking on so much of their sense of self, maybe you gain a Conditon while you hold on to the (simgle) move?  Paul has a good idea, I'd add a line that "The MC may tell you to take an additional move".<br/><br/>(Nomenclature wise, I think Be Like You and WLY, TLY names should be switched.

Alright, the easy ones: the Look is a good idea and fits in great - in it goes! The advancements, well, I'd forgotten how to count it seems. I'll be dropping a take-from-another-playbook as you suggested, it's the most expendable thing here - you're already all about stealing from everyone else with your own moves, you don't need advancements to do it. So yeah, those go right into the Skin.<br/>Additionally, I agree about WLY, TLY and Be Like You being switched name-wise. I'm leaving it for the moment since I'm trying to come up with something even better/unique for taking moves to replace the name Be Like You entirely. If I can't come up with anything else though, I will indeed be switching their names.<br/><br/>You're right that I've basically entirely ignored Conditions. Both Be Like You and Linked are places that can accept them into them pretty easily, so I think I'm gonna go with that.<br/>The balance on Be Like You is definitely skewed - that's one of the reasons I was weird on writing a move-copying move originally, I wasn't quite sure how to balance it. The two things that you guys mentioned though are both great ideas - dropping the ability to gain more Moves (on purpose at least) and drawing in a way for the MC to be choosing moves instead cuz I think that sounds really cool. I AM a little attached to letting them keep the move as opposed to losing it after using it for two reasons, because I have a bit of a logic issue with forgetting things while still in their form and because there's it would probably get a little wonky if they chose passive moves that aren't necessarily USED (something the Hollow avoids by needing to be targeted, ensuring it's a usable one).<br/>So let's try something out...<br/>Be Like You: When you Transform into another PC's form, you get one of their moves. If you rolled a 10+ on the Transform roll, you select one of their Skin moves and consider yourself to have that move until you change form again. If you rolled a 7-9, the MC chooses the move instead. After using the move once, you take the Condition ________ until you change form again.<br/>So what does that do for me? Well, you only ever get one move, it's not an additional complexifying roll, you might get the choice or the MC might, and you get a Condition if you start taking advantage of it. I didn't want to make the condition show up right off the bat, I would personally consider that quite a deterrent, especially because that would mean that EVERY time I became another PC I'd be stuck with a Condition.<br/>What's missing? It's pretty obvious - I have no idea what to name the damn Condition. I had Blurred Identity until I realized that seems hard for people to take advantage of, which kinda makes it a false consequence.<br/>Unless I'm being dense and there are ways to use that. No clue really what to do with it though. Workin' on it.<br/>What exactly "Use" means depends on the move. I'd say that if they get somethng like The Hunger, the first time they take advantage of the "heedlessly pursue" bonus would be the use. For rolling moves and cases like Short Rest For The Wicked, it's pretty obvious what "use" is. If you were to, in theory, take their "+1 to x stat" move (which I should note - WLY, TLY does NOT automatically give you that bonus, though it does give advancement bonuses) it'd be the first time you roll that Stat. It works out pretty okay, since the broader the uses of the move, the faster you're stuck with the Condition, and that seems right to me.<br/>As for Paul's idea about Sex Moves and Darkest Self, I'd say yes to former and no to the latter. If you DO get saddled with (or choose, I suppose) a Sex Move, it's IN ADDITION to your current one, you get two things that trigger.<br/><br/>Definitely think that looks a bit more balanced. A lot more, actually.<br/><br/>Let's just hit out an altered Linked real quick...<br/>Linked:  "While in the form of another character, you both know and experience the emotions of the other, though you cannot necessarily distinguish those emotions as being from a foreign source. When you allow the other's emotions to affect your behavior, you can take an appropriate Condition (eg <i>Furious, Despondant, Elated</i>) to take a String on the other character."<br/>Yeah, I'm feelin' that.<br/>Thanks for the feedback, it's totally helping a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405575/#Comment_405575" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T10:51:14+00:00" title="February  6, 2013 10:51AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like the new Linked.

Maybe, "When you spend a week as someone else gain an xp."                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405581/#Comment_405581" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T12:10:52+00:00" title="February  6, 2013 12:10PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!<br/><br/>There actually already IS an xp move!

Anyway, you don't have to name the Condition, leave it open to be assigned as appropriate to the fiction.  You gain <i>a</i> Condition.

I'm gonna pull it for now (to make it shorter and more concise if nothing else), but be watching it while I play. When I play I'll take that move and pay attention to how it's balancing out. All of them could enjoy some playtesting of course, but this move has the most potential to be threateningly off-balance.<br/>If it DOES go back in I'll make a decision re: open-ended-ness vs specificity, but no need to bother right now.<br/>"Be Like You: When you Transform into another PC's form, you get one of their moves. If you rolled a 10+ on the Transform roll, you select one of their Skin moves and consider yourself to have that move until you change form again.

Crawl inside your head- I remember seeing a similar move somewhere, which gave three options (maybe secret hope, secret fear, or secret shame- or something like that)  that the other player had choose from and tell you.  The reason being that it might be hard to come up with one of those three on the spot.  <br/><br/>I'd like to see, I don't know, maybe the MC asking the question.  Less adversarial that way.  Or sometimes, maybe they get to ask one back through 'personality bleed' or similar.  Like maybe you get to ask the question, and they can ask one back if they give you a String on them.<br/><br/>In some ways, these modifier moves (like Crawl, BLY) could be adding additional options on the 7-9 or 10+ Transform results.  Would need a bit of rework to make it happen, though.<br/><br/>Overall, I can see some players (including myself, perhaps!) getting a little annoyed at being the target of this Skin, especially with the Crawl questions.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Something to discuss in the player and MC notes about bringing it to the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405709/#Comment_405709" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T02:48:30+00:00" title="February  8, 2013  2:48AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never actually considered asking questions as something that feels adversarial. My mind sees it as an opportunity to reveal more coolness about a character, and if someone's giving me a chance (and perhaps a sweet provocative prompt), even better. However, I guess I can see how it can feel like putting people on the spot or some such, so I can certainly see where you're coming from.  So yeah, let's bounce a question back! Now you're both on the spot, and the rest of the table learns about you both.<br/>I'm not even gonna make it conditional when they can bounce a question back, it's just a thing they can do in response.<br/><br/>I DO like it being an open-ended question though, rather than one of a set of options like those. While those are certainly cool (and they come from one of The Infernal's bargains - the actual ones seem to be secret fears secret desires, and secret strengths, though secret shame is hot) I like the freedom to learn what you want about someone, and I imagine that often the question is going to be something that allows you to better impersonate someone ("What did you have planned for this afternoon", "I overheard you say X, what did you mean by it", "What girl do you have a crush on" - that last one is pretty great if your intent is malicious too). <br/><br/>I considered making them alterations based on the Transform roll, but in general, I'm okay with leaving as is actually. I may change my tune eventually, but oh well.<br/><br/>I understand the difficulty of being targeted, even minus the questions. More than any other character, the Doppleganger can't be targeted for retribution. Witches are pretty tough too in that manner - they do bad things to you and you don't know where it's coming from. I mean, Werewolves and Chosen and Ghouls, you know when they're coming at you, and you can fight back. The Doppleganger is a subterfuge master, and that can be annoying.<br/>However, the big thing that I think mitigates it is that, a lot of the time, a Doppleganger isn't malicious toward its target. He copies mostly because he <i>idolizes</i> a person. He puts the others on a pedestal and tries to step up there with them. Now, almost inevitably, the new body isn't quite what they thought it'd be, and may turn against the others for "deceiving" them or some such in their petty teenage way. When that happens, yeah, being the target sucks. But a lot of the time, at least at first, a Doppleganger doesn't start copying a person with intent to harm, with many exceptions of course.<br/>So, uh, yeah. I have stuff to talk about in Playing The Doppleganger!<br/><br/>---------------<br/>So, thanks to that, I have two bits of rule text to amend.<br/><br/>Crawl Inside Your Head: Crawl Inside Your Head: "When you spend time and intimacy with someone, it counts as closely studying their mannerisms and habits. From then on, whenever you assume their form you may ask one question of the other character's player. It needn't be something you could reasonably know, and they have to answer completely and honestly. If you do ask a question, they get to ask one in return, same rules."<br/>Simple enough. The other change?<br/><br/>Personality Bleed: "When you return to your original form, alter your stats based upon the stats of the form you just changed back from. Whichever stat they had highest, increase your own stat by 1 (to a maximum of +3). Whichever they had lowest, decrease your own stat by 1. If you had been copying an NPC, the MC will tell you which stats to change.<br/>These alterations go away when you next Transform."<br/>THAT is definitely the real name for Impressionable/Learn From You/etc. I'm actually <i>happy</i> with this one. Perfect.<br/><br/>In other news, I got the Skin template from Joe so I'm working on laying it out right now. I did the art for it tonight, so I'm just waiting on permission to use it (as I built it off of a stock art on deviantArt). I like it, and it uses the same kind of idea as Rob's. As soon as I get the go-ahead, I'll post up up the PDF.

That'd open the door for MCs to make Hard Moves based on the situation. Also, maybe clarify that the third choice means your disguise is perfect, like "your flawless disguise won't last long".<br/><br/>Personality Bleed: I like it, but I think there's an easier way to word that move. Could't you say something like "swap your highest and lowest stats to their highest and lowest stats". That'd allow you to cut the line about resetting after each transformation.<br/><br/> Be Like You: I think you need to clarify what move the player can take when they transform. Can they take _any_ move from the other PC's Skin book or only one that the other character has already taken? If it's the former, what about wording the move like "on a 10 up, pick a move from that player's Skin book. On a 7-9, the MC chooses one for you instead".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405854/#Comment_405854" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-10T11:22:47+00:00" title="February 10, 2013 11:22AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

First though: it opens the door? The way I've read Apocalypse World (and I've never considered MH to have changed this) is that they always can make a hard move after a failure. The reasoning behind the miss clause is to make it explicit that MCs should also feel free to allow the transformation to go through, rather than always considering it as "well, you failed to transform, and then here's my hard move." A good MC could probably already do this, but I wanted to make it explicit.<br/>And I can definitely refine the last option like that. <br/><br/>Personality Bleed: that's an excellent way to put that! I've been trying to find the best way to word it ever since writing it, and while I settled for what I had, that is way better.<br/><br/>Be Like You: It's the former. You're copying them, not some monster LIKE them, which means you only get what they can do.

Like, check if a move has a miss clause, and if so use that, otherwise pick something from the MC's list of moves. But maybe I'm wrong. I couldn't find it anywhere in <i>Monsterhearts</i>, and I don't remember what <i>Apocalypse World</i> said. I get the feeling both authors would respond with "whatever makes sense for the fiction" if asked about it.<br/><br/>I get wanting to explain that the Doppleganger can still assume someone's form on a miss.

Not in the player advice though, in an Under The Doppleganger's Skin bit for the MC (which I haven't written but will). So yeah, axing the Miss clause for the time being.<br/><br/>And I didn't let the other PC do the choosing because I hadn't thought of that! It's a cool idea and I've been thinking about it throughout the day. For the moment I kinda want to leave it with the MC since, as copying a player DOES mark them as a target in a way, and I think letting the target pick their attacker's weapon would lead to them picking some of the more harmless/useless possibilities, and that can be pretty boring too. Letting an impartial onlooker like the MC choose seems the best option for the moment - I'm gonna be considering using it with the other PC though. I'm probably gonna ask the MC to let the other PC pick a couple of times to try it out. I'll get back to how that works out.<br/><br/>Personality Bleed: Actually, I'm not sure I want to actually swap the stats fully - just the +1/-1 change was more what I was looking for since it had less radical potential for change and it even allowed you to become better than the other person is. Gonna leave it for the moment since I don't quite have a good way to word THAT still. That's active thinking though.<br/><br/>So let's meter out the changes to be applied to the next draft:<br/>Sex Move: Add an additional line break before "If you are transformed, Hold Steady..."<br/>Transform: Remove the miss clause.<br/>Be Like You: Rephrase from "select one of their skin moves" to "select a Skin move they've already taken".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406064/#Comment_406064" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-12T18:18:25+00:00" title="February 12, 2013  6:18PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HyveMind was kind enough to a better layout job on the PDF, making it look just like the real thing!

And yeah, I definitely think it needs to revert, for both mechanical and fictional reasons. Mechanically, it's as Paul said - if you're transforming into one person multiple times (which is likely due to amount of time and effort it takes to be able to copy someone), their top stat is gonna max out pretty fast. Fictionally, the idea behind the move is less that your actual personality is being changed by the experience and more that some of it lingers for a bit after you shift but that it'll go back to normal later.<br/><br/>I kinda like that Paul! I'm cautious about making TOO much hinge on that one roll of Transform, but the way it's worded is really clean in a way I can't make it normally, so I definitely might do that. Gonna have that on a sticky note while we play, probably try it out a couple times once I get that move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd" title="HyveMynd"><img alt="HyveMynd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/564/nZ3DM2UV4QM5S.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd">HyveMynd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406181/#Comment_406181" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T19:53:02+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  7:53PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of <b>Personality Bleed</b> a lot. It encourages the Doppleganger to seek out someone they want to emulate, and copy them to increase their stats. It also encourages the MC to think about what kind of stats NPCs would have in preparation for the Doppleganger copying them.<br/><br/>You do need the reset clause, because as Paul_T points out, you could just keep increasing your stats by copying the same person again and again. You could prevent that another way, by having the stats change only the first time the Doppleganger copies someone. That's encourage the player to constantly seek out new people to copy for the stat boost.<br/><br/>I'm still not thrilled about the wording and bookkeeping though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406218/#Comment_406218" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T09:28:15+00:00" title="February 14, 2013  9:28AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bookkeeping-wise, the easiest approach is probably to have a floating +1 to a stat. <br/><br/>Basically it's +1 forward to rolls on that stat until you use the ability again, at which point you get the +1 forward to a different stat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409160/#Comment_409160" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T13:47:21+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  1:47PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there!<br/><br/>I'm going to try out this Skin tonight in a game.<br/><br/>If you have any changes from the current version ("v1"), please let me know!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409184/#Comment_409184" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T16:16:25+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  4:16PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see, I don't have anything radical/specific.

href="/forums/search?Search=%23monsterhearts&amp;Mode=like">#monsterhearts</a>  was groundbreakingly great!<br/>We had a guest star player (+Paul T.), who came in for a one shot and tried out the Doppleganger (named Adrianne) skin to much success.<br/><br/>* Posing as Sophie, Adrianne convinced Gabe the Angel to finally make a move. Of course, Gabe ended up making a move on the real Sophie, who happens to be possessed by a demon! That's right, out resident Angel lost his virginity to a demon. Oh, that cannot be a good thing, right? Not at all.<br/>* Posing as Gabe, Adrianne tries to sew dissent between <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23dakotatheteenagewerewolf&amp;Mode=like">#dakotatheteenagewerewolf</a> and Ophelia the Mortal and then convinced Dakota that Gabe was still in love/lust for Sophie, so Dakota told fake-Gabe to go "f**k the demon out of her" and ran back home to text her sorta hunky, sorta BF Joey so they could exchange "I love yous" for the first time, and do the deed, for the first time.<br/>* Since Adrianne had created a mini-rift between Dakota and Ophelia about Gabe, this prompted Ophelia to admit she was actually seeing Luke, Dakota's eldest brother (who is a Vampire, oh my!); rather than freak out on her, Dakota, always a pretty pragmatic person, said, "Oh, really? Well, that's cool... uh, use protection?!?"<br/><br/>So so loved last night's game. K. is a masterful MC who allows us to have moments of sanity in the whirlwind of our PC's chaotic lives, but mixes in drama without going over the top.<br/><br/>I should probably feel guilty for admitting this, but I actually got a little giddy for Dakota when she told Joey she loved him, when she actually opened up to someone. Not giddy like I did anything, but that kind of giddy when your favorite character of your favorite TV show finally achieves something or kisses the girl/guy. That kind of giddy. I had that. And it was good.<br/><br/>We spent maybe an hour after the game just talking about the game, what makes it so fun for us, how it is different from other games/groups we play, fun stuff. Love this game, love this group.</blockquote>\nIf you're on Google+, whisper me your G+ name and I'll include you in the conversation.<br/><br/>More thoughts on the actual Skin coming later...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409685/#Comment_409685" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T08:30:04+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  8:30AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Doppleganger was a powerful catalyst for a variety of crazy stuff in this game, and we had a good time. We're having a chat about it now, and I'm going to copy some of the feedback here. Here's the first thing I wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote>The Doppleganger really jumped out at me immediately because of the potential for "sexy, messy stories" -- it's just perfect for what Monsterhearts tries to do. Oh, the potential! It's a very exciting Skin. What are the challenges around getting it to work well?<br/><br/>Here's the first one:<br/><br/><i>Who's fooled by the Doppleganger?</i><br/><br/>This is difficult because the Transform move tells us whether the Doppleganger manages to take on another person's form, but it doesn't tell us how other people react. Can they figure out that they aren't really talking to their friend Gabe?<br/><br/>As a player, clearly there's no chance you're going to be fooled, so you know exactly what's going on: this is not Gabe. So that's off the table. What about your character? Does he or she know it's not Gabe? This gets trickier. If you like the way things are going, you willingly play along and it's all fun and exciting. But if playing along is not in your character's interests, or not ultimately compelling to you, then you have a difficult choice: "Does my character know that something's amiss?" How do you decide? You can't really judge by the player's impersonation (it's obviously not going to fool you, the player). Sometimes you can make a guess based on the fiction ("Gabe doesn't like anchovies, but he's eating a pizza and enjoying it"), but other times it's a very awkward position to be in, and feels totally arbitrary. (Am I right? How did it feel from your end, other players?)<br/><br/>So, I think it's a bit problematic. Having some kind of mechanical support for which way things go would really help make this smoother and easier. This is why I really like Rich's suggestion here: it does exactly that. I was considering a very similar rule/move after our game. Here it is:<br/><br/><b><i>Face Dancer</i></b><br/><i>When you're transformed and another player begins to suspect something's amiss, you can tell them your impersonation is convincing and ask them to play along. If they accept, they mark experience, and are convinced that you are who you appear to be until you transform or reveal your identity. If they refuse, they may do as they like, leaving open the option to suspect you immediately or decide something's wrong with your impersonation later.</i><br/><br/>I think this makes the decision a lot easier for the other player: "Ok, I'll play along." Or, "No, let me see where this goes." And, in the second case, they won't feel guilty if, later in the scene, they say, "Wait! I think that's not Gabe!"\ufeff</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409778/#Comment_409778" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T14:17:21+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  2:17PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is Face Dancer a freebie move?

I entirely agree with everything you guys are saying about the trouble of determining whether or not you can tell if things are amiss. My thought process when I wrote it originally is a little overbearing and overpowerful - I was thinking that, as it requires meticulous study to make it work, and if they DON'T take the "It doesn't hold up under scrutiny" complication on a 7-9, that means that you got the look right and you've studied them well enough that your actions wouldn't seem out of character. However, I'm definitely a much bigger fan of operating using that Face Dancer move instead.<br/><br/>I would make it a free move, yes. Because a) if you don't take it it didn't fix anything, and b) the only real benefit to having it for the Doppleganger is that others would be more inclined to believe their facade. So basically exactly what Lisa and Rob said.<br/><br/>That's a very cool thing though. Face Dancer is really neat (possible alternative: strings instead of xp? I'm just always looking for ways to drag Strings into things). Really looking forward to hearing the other issues you guys came up with.

When you do, both players must talk privately, at which point the other player is offered a choice.  They can either accept your bargain or reject it.  If they accept it, they play your character until this effect ends, and you play theirs, at which point they get experience.  If they reject it, you continue playing your own characters.  However, regardless of how they choose, which characters each of you are playing is concealed until one of you has to consult their character sheet (at which point this effect ends).<br/><br/>The idea, of course, being that in a completely voluntary transaction (the doppleganger player must offer, and the other player must accept for the switch to happen), the line is blurred between the two characters -- even if the other player rejects the offer, the other players don't, for a while, know which way they chose, and so are more inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410033/#Comment_410033" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T22:38:34+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 10:38PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2013 10:43PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

There are many possible answers, but it's not clear which ones are best and which ones are trouble.<br/><br/>If I take your shape, can I use your Strings? (The default is presumably "no", but that doesn't make sense in certain situations.)<br/>If I take your shape, can I still use <i>my</i> Strings?<br/>If I take your shape, do my Conditions still apply?<br/>If I take your shape, do your Conditions apply to me?<br/>If I take your shape and I gain Conditions, do I still have them when I change back? Or do you? Or do they just disappear?<br/><br/>These are not obvious questions, I think. We may be able to handle them by writing moves (maybe using another player's Strings when in their form is possible, but you have to take a move to be able to do so), or in some other ways, but an obvious and clear solution isn't entirely obvious, at least not to me.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410041/#Comment_410041" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T00:15:17+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 12:15AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> : Using other people's Strings was an early idea I had when I was concocting Transform, but I ended up very specifically deciding the answer to be NO. You can take advantage of fictional situations and mess them up for other players, but they actually risked dice rolls to get those strings, just spending them out from under them isn't very fair, even considering how often this class crosses ownership boundaries. Now, that said, Strings are almost always fictionally justified - whether you turned them on, or otherwise gained some advantage over them, there's a reasoning behind the String, and THAT you can take advantage of. There's no mechanical benefit there, but it's enough to change the fictional scenario. As an example, I'll make something up with the characters from the game you played. If at some point prior Gabe had Turned On Dakota himself and gotten a String on her, and then you became fake-Gabe and jumped in there, you could take advantage of the fact that you've turned her on and you have some emotional leverage (prompting a different move snowball than if Gabe had never made the move), but you don't actually get to spend that String he got.<br/>Additionally, if you score Strings on someone while in another's form, they're the ones who reap the narrative benefit (and you while you're in the shape I suppose), but you're the one who earned the token, so it's your's.<br/>As for your own Strings, I say yes, you keep 'em in other forms! Strings are both an abstract game thing and a narrative piece. Just like how I'm saying you can use the narrative piece of the other person since you look like them, but you didn't actually earn the mechanical token, it's the reverse for yourself. You don't look like you - people aren't going to react like they would to your regular form, but you still have that mechanical benefit you can cash in.<br/><br/>Essentially, I'm saying that the narrative effect sticks to the character's shape, while the mechanical Strings stick to the player who earns them. This is a bit of a disconnect with the blended fiction/crunch of the game, especially when a transformed Doppleganger uses his mechanical strings without the narrative that caused it, but I think it works - Strings are a generic currency, they aren't actually attached to the situations that created them. I can earn a String by turning you on and then later spend it to make my punch hit harder.<br/><br/>As for Conditions when Transformed, I'm saying your Conditions apply to you, but their Conditions don't. Conditions aren't descriptors of the physical world to me, they're aspects of you character's psyche. Obviously it makes sense for some traits, like Distracted or Drained (obvious mental state ones) to follow you with the Transform. Even appearance-based ones though I think are matters of the mind. If you have the condition Ugly on you, that's not describing the physical or you would always have had it from the very beginning. No, someone made you FEEL ugly, and that feeling doesn't go away just because you change your shape. Now, shifting into someone beautiful and being told how hot you are a few times probably counts as the "appropriate action" to cross off the Condition, but that's something else. Even social conditions seem to follow from this. If I'm Shunned, it's again a facet of the mind - I FEEL shunned, and I Transform into the right people so I don't have to feel that way anymore. Finding the right person to yank off your Conditions is actually a great motivator to go out and start observing other characters.<br/>And as for their Conditions, it's the same thing. They might have the Ugly condition, but that's how they <i>perceive</i> themselves. You can give a beautiful character the Ugly condition if you body-shame them, and if you transform into them, you're not gonna inherit that emotional hurt. Maybe they're actually avoiding your target, and he has the Shunned condition, but you don't instantly feel shunned just by becoming them.<br/>Potentially though, Linked could have some interesting implications for swapping Conditions around or something, because then you ARE feeling what they're feeling.<br/><br/>So that's how I've been thinking about these things. I didn't address them in the rules because nothing actually changed - your Strings and Conditions stay yours, their Strings and Conditions stay theirs. There's just some emotional discussion of why that would be the case. I'm willing to change my mind about some of this though if you've got convincing counter-reasons! Except the "using up their hard-earned Strings" thing. I'm really not fond of stealing their actual game assets.<br/>The benefits of this approach are:<br/>* Mechanically simple, nothing has changed.<br/>* Kinda makes sense if you really think it out.<br/>The cons are:<br/>* There are probably rare cases where it would make sense to take their Strings/Conditions.<br/>* Kinda doesn't make sense if you <i>don't</i> really think it out.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/mneme">@mneme</a> : That's interesting! A curious but intriguing mechanical and narrative thing. I'm struggling to fit it into my conception of the Skin though.  Primarily, the bit that wigs me out is the idea of a mutual shift. It doesn't quite click for me that <i>they</i> play <i>you</i> for a time. It's a really creative and interesting thing to do with it though, and I need to sit and think about that for a little bit. If you want to just generally elaborate a little more it might help, because I really want to be able to make use of that idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410088/#Comment_410088" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T09:17:03+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  9:17AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great answers and thoughts again, Max. I think you're right on.<br/><br/>The situations I'm thinking of particularly, though:<br/><br/>* If the Doppleganger impersonates a PC, maybe they could give other people strings on them (a la Queen's "Bought Loyalty" move). Or spend some of their Strings in exchange for something else (e.g. the player marks experience). I agree that spending someone else's Strings is always problematic, though, but I still think there might be some room for interesting possibilities to explore.<br/><br/>* The situation which I think is more likely, though, is taking the form of an NPC who has Strings on people, and using those. That doesn't "rob" anyone of hard-earned benefits but gives an interesting incentive to impersonating particular people. Maybe. (Like I said, I'm just thinking about it, I'm not sure about any of this.)<br/><br/>I also like the idea of impersonating people so as to get rid of Conditions. This could be written in to the Transform move (on a 10+, get rid of an appropriate Condition...) in some way.<br/><br/>It's also an interesting potential mechanical bit to play with. "When you transform back into yourself, take a Condition based on how pathetic you feel compared to the person you just were."<br/><br/>(Again, just brainstorming out loud, I don't think any of these ideas are all that great as is, I just think they're interesting to explore.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410163/#Comment_410163" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T17:22:28+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  5:22PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose if you're TRADING to get their strings it isn't so intrusive. There's move potential in that - the question is, is that more significant an element than one of the existing moves? Cuz if I add Face Dancer it'll already be a bit crowded, yet another might be too many.<br/><br/>And NPCs is a great point. When I think about Transforming, I default to copying PCs, but that's obviously not all that's gonna happen. And I definitely have no problem with taking NPC strings. That's definitely something I could right in, and I'm majorly considering it. I have one niggling concern, but I'll get to that in a second.<br/><br/>Impersonating as a direct means of removing a condition could be possible, but I'm not so sure about that. I kinda think it's better as sticking with the "appropriate action" thing.<br/><br/>The taking a condition when you turn back though, THAT I'm feelin'. It really helps cement the "I'm doing this because I hate my own form" thing. The trouble with that is the same as tacking on the bit about NPC Strings, and that's that Transform has the potential to become an extremely complicated move if left to do what it wants. There's a lot that I could keep tacking on to flesh it out, but I risk making it a very complex move. So I need to watch out for that.<br/><br/>Here's what I'm thinking from those. The condition thing, that I can put into Transform. I really like it.<br/>The Strings things, on the other hand, is a new move. I imagine it would have 2 clauses, looking something like this:<br/>"THE STRINGS MOVE: When you're transformed as an NPC, you have access to their Strings and can use them as if they were your own.<br/>When you're transformed as a PC, you can offer that player experience [or a string on you or something] to take one of their Strings."<br/><br/>And this thinking about NPCs and Strings has upped my ideal goal for my own Doppleganger! I don't want to just pretend to be the Infernal to his Dark Power, I want to pretend to be the Dark Power to his Infernal! That'll be a fun session.<br/><br/>And thanks for the brainstorming! It's cool stuff, and bringing up things I totally forgot to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410185/#Comment_410185" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T23:42:55+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 11:42PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on again, Max.

These are tricky for a Doppleganger!<br/><br/>It's the only Skin (as far as I know) which suggests the character might... just not be all that attractive. From that perspective, it would make sense to give the Doppleganger a low hot score. However, we really want the Doppleganger to take on people's forms and manipulate and seduce people... that's where a huge part of the fun is with this Skin. So that suggests hot should be one of the "good" stats.<br/><br/>So it's a bit of a tricky situation. Switching your stats with another character's is a potential solution, but I'm not sure it's the best one (plus, it has to be chosen as a move, and you only choose one at the beginning). <br/><br/>I'd be tempted to use some unorthodox stat block (e.g. Hot -1, Cold 0, Volatile 0, Dark 1), and a substitution move which says, "When you're in the form of someone else, switch your Dark with your Hot, Cold, or Volatile, as fits that person." (This also means lots of Dopplegangers will look like Hot -1, Cold 0, Volatile 0, Dark 2, which sounds about perfect to me.)<br/><br/>Having a more "neutral" stat block is not in line with Monsterhearts, but does fit thematically with the idea of the Doppleganger being a tabula rasa, a non-entity, except when s/he takes someone else's form.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not sure. Maybe it's fine as is. I'm just brainstorming! But I like the idea of having to transform in order to do certain things (maybe even spending some of your Strings?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410696/#Comment_410696" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-28T10:29:03+00:00" title="March 28, 2013 10:29AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about stat swap move?

Or is it how attractive, confident, sexy, and assertive you <i>act</i>? When I look at the stats, your Cold, your Volatile, your Dark, they're representative of how you're acting. Plus, when you Turn Someone On or Manipulating them, aren't you literally making use of and taking advantage of how Hot you are? If you don't think you're hot, would you be very good at all at taking advantage of your body even if it's more than you think? I mean, if I don't think I'm sexy, I'm not gonna go around using my sexuality to get what I want, and if I tried I wouldn't exactly know how to do it very well. On the other hand, a lot of Turning Someone On isn't an intentional motion by the character, so its possible that you still have a good Stat, you just can't do it intentionally.<br/>So, can I be totally sexy and still have a low Hot? Is Hot about how I act (like other stats) or is it about how I actually look?<br/><br/>My own personal take is that, like Conditions, the things on your sheet are about your mind. You may be hot, but you're not Hot unless you feel it and can take advantage of it. Maybe you Turn Someone On or they're swayed by your Manipulation without your intention, but unless you know you know you're Hot, you have a hard time actually taking advantage of these things.<br/>By that logic, I'm not opposed to keeping the Hot as a -1. However, the idea of a non-standard set of stats could certainly be interesting, and I'm definitely not opposed to the presence of a stat swapping move. Well, sort of. I'm opposed a bit because, personally, I tend to find moves that swap basic move stats to be a bit of a design crutch and a touch boring, an because I'm running a bit low on slots for moves since I don't want an overwhelming list. A move that mirrors a stat is more interesting, and is already somewhat represented within Personality Bleed (which makes you a bit better based on how good they were). If I wanted a perfect mirror, I run into the issue of a character ending up with a pile of really high stats with very little work. Perhaps as an Improvement though if I can think of how to word it.<br/><br/>Those are some good thoughts you guys had.

The character is noticeably bland, neither attractive or cool but maybe a bit scary if you actually bother to notice them.<br/><br/>If you're character is obsessed about being hotter or cooler, they get Walk Like You or Personality Bleed or both, so they can get hotness or coolness off of someone else, which fits the concept (and the emotional center) of the character perfectly. This gets more at the "I want to be like him or her" part of the character.<br/><br/>If you're more interested in being directly manipulative with the transform thing, you take Crawl Inside Your Head or Your Evil Twin. This gets more at the "I hate them for what they have that I don't have" part of the character.<br/><br/>The character is about being someone else to get what you want because you don't feel that you can get what you want by being yourself. The current stats reflect that just fine - Hot and Cold are the "get what you want" stats, Volatile and Dark are the "get frustrated cause you can't get what you want" stats. I think the current stat layout is a good fit.<br/><br/>(As an aside, I like that the character fits the Single White Female movie type of character just fine. There's nothing that says that Transform is actually supernatural and not just someone using clothes and hair and such to pretend to be someone else. Sure your stats change, but as we said, your stats have as much to do with your confidence and feelings as they do with physical aptitude/appearance/etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410727/#Comment_410727" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-28T17:27:44+00:00" title="March 28, 2013  5:27PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's some interesting stuff to think about.<br/><br/>I came up with the version I did because I imagined being an unattractive Doppleganger who must collect personalities to transform into in order to accomplish certain means. The current moves do that in various ways, but they are all more complex (e.g. making up stat blocks for NPCs, or comparing stat blocks and making two adjustments, then remembering to erase them later, which means there's some chance of stats out of the regular range, etc).<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of stat substitution moves in general (for the reasons Max mentions), but in this case it might be appropriate. You take the form of Cordelia because she's a real bitch and you switch your Dark with your Cold while you're in her form. You take the form of Luke because he's super hot, and so you switch your Dark with your Hot when you're in his form. And when you turn into Cassidy the Werewolf, that's when you feel Volatile.<br/><br/>So you shift forms when you want to change out your personality. (The current moves do this as well, this was just another suggestion for how to do it. Again, I'm not sure if it's better or worse, I'm just brainstorming in public here.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410740/#Comment_410740" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-29T00:33:19+00:00" title="March 29, 2013 12:33AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely agree that each of the things is competently handled by the existing batch of moves - I feel pretty confident in them as a whole. I'm really just looking to see if anything else might be EVEN BETTER. Your assessment of the stats is spot on though, sticking with H-1/C-1/V+1/D+1 is the smart choice.<br/><br/>And Paul, you're right that this is one of those cases where a stat-substitution move isn't a crutch, it's thematically appropriate. However, especially with Face Dancer in the pile, we've got a great complement of moves and I think one more be a bit crowded. But it's definitely one of those ones where, if I decide something needs replacing, a substitution move in that vein is a safe and easy move to go with.<br/><br/>And he idea of a non-supernatural transformation by dressing like them is interesting, and terrifying for reasons I can't talk about at this point.<br/><br/>Also, Rob, that's a great breakdown of the purpose behind the moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414336/#Comment_414336" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-19T20:33:36+00:00" title="May 19, 2013  8:33PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, resurrecting this to talk about something that's been itching at me for about two months now.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1571708637/monsterhearts-second-skins" rel="nofollow">THIS IS A LINK TO JACKSON TEGU'S NEW KICKSTARTER, MONSTERHEARTS: SECOND SKINS.</a><br/>First off, you should all back it because the stuff is awesome, I haven't played any of them but I've seen them on the table and they're freakin' sweet.<br/><br/>One in particular is of interest to the Doppleganger, and that's The Cuckoo. I became aware of the Cuckoo when I emailed Joe asking for the Skin template and he mentioned that Jackson had something very similar in the pipeline and I decided to email him about it. He shared the example move from the Kickstarter (reproduced here) with me:\n<blockquote>Feathers<br/><br/>When you dress in someone else's clothes in an attempt to pass as them, roll with hot. On a 10 up, you're passing as them - face and body.  You'd fool their mother and their favorite hookup. \u2022 On a 7-9, same as above, but choose one:<br/><br/>    someone suspects, <br/><br/>    the clothes are noticed missing, <br/><br/>    you receive some unwanted attention.<br/><br/>While you're passing as someone, give social Conditions you receive to them instead. This won't let you avoid physical Conditions, though.</blockquote>\nAs far as the situations go, this is eerily similar to what I came up with independently. Gotta say this struck some fear into my heart - Jackson's been playtesting and revising this baby a heck of a lot longer than I've been at The Doppleganger. I didn't want to just be obsoleted by The Cuckoo, so I looked for a way around how similar they appeared to be on the surface. I haven't had a look at the complete Cuckoo (I meant to at Fabulous Replacement, but forgot - I'll probably check it out next time I can get to Story Games Olympia) but my basic musings were generally confirmed by Jackson as making sense, so I'm feeling okay about them.<br/><br/>See, what I gleaned from the move is 1) motivation behind the Cuckoo's desires and 2) the different nature of the transformation. When a Cuckoo transforms, they're taking on the appearance of someone else. It's a very physical thing, and they aren't actually changed, they're simply disguise masters. So why is a Cuckoo doing this? In my estimation, it's the desire to take advantage of what they have. You want to use their things and have access to their stuff and be with their friends. But it's always about using their actual tangible THINGS, it's about wanting what they have. It's petty and physical.<br/>The Doppleganger, on the other hand, doesn't become a person just to have their stuff. Sure, that helps, and I'm sure the Dopplegangers of the world sometimes transform just to take advantage, but at their core, the thing that makes a Doppleganger transform is self-loathing. The Doppleganger doesn't see greatness in others and want to hold it, it sees awfulness in itself and wants to escape it. And when it takes on a person, it doesn't just look like them, the Doppleganger IS that person, attitude included. The Doppleganger wants to <i>be</i> them, and that means taking on their personality.<br/><br/>The Cuckoo is manipulative and covetous and envious and physical. The Doppleganger is desperate and clingy and hero-worshippy and emotional. Worldly vs. Cerebral.<br/><br/>Another separation we found was that the Cuckoo actually solves their envy when they take people's stuff. The Doppleganger's problem is eternal - transformation is a patch, but they'll grow disallusioned with their hero and find a new one, they never actually feel better about themselves. Mechanically, the Cuckoo is a Hot skin while the Doppleganger is Dark, and I play with Stats a lot in the moves while Jackson plays with Conditions.<br/><br/>I'm confident that the division is strong enough in theory that we needn't be stepping on each others' toes. I'm not entirely sure if that sort of division is apparent inside of the mechanics of the Doppleganger right now though. Until the Kickstarter is fulfilled people won't have their hands on the Cuckoo for comparison, but does anyone here have any insight on how much you can see that separation in the two, that specific characterization I've given to the Doppleganger? I've been pretty anxious about this for a while, but now that the Kickstarter is launched and the Cuckoo's name is out there I can finally talk about it.<br/><br/>Also, hey, <a href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">@jackson_tegu</a> have you had any additional thoughts on how/where this split between our skins could go?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414340/#Comment_414340" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-19T21:29:40+00:00" title="May 19, 2013  9:29PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating.

This ability follows all the normal rules for hypnosis, but while somebody is under your sway they won't question any inconsistencies or poor acting on your part.<br/><br/>(Werewolf) SKINSHIFTER: Your human form is a bit more mutable than most of your kind. Whenever you escape your darkest self, you can change what (or who) you look like as a normal person.<br/><br/>(Fae) GLAMOUR: When you weave a faerie illusion to disguise yourself as another person, roll +hot. On a 10+, the MC will tell you one thing that will break the illusion, on a 7-9, three. Common things include the touch of metal, hearing your real name spoken aloud, interacting with someone wearing their jacket inside out, fae magic is just full of complicated loopholes and it's basically impossible to keep track of them all.<br/><br/>(Witch) SHADOW THIEF: If you have a string on someone, you can steal their shadow (pro tip: do it while they're not looking or they may ask awkward questions!) and then wear it over your own face like a mask, flawlessly impersonating the individual in question. They cast no shadow while this is going on, however, and you take -1 ongoing to all rolls until you release it: it kind of takes concentrated effort to keep the shadow from squirming away at an inopportune moment.<br/><br/>(Infernal) THOUSAND MASKS (bargain, not move): You may grant your Dark Patron a string on you to look exactly like any other individual until the next sunrise or sunset, or to ask your Dark Patron "What would the person I'm impersonating do in this situation I'm in right now?".<br/><br/>And so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414468/#Comment_414468" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-21T12:58:49+00:00" title="May 21, 2013 12:58PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *Applause!*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414470/#Comment_414470" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-21T14:09:13+00:00" title="May 21, 2013  2:09PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, perhaps the Kitsune takes other peoples' forms to make mischief.

It definitely takes a load off my mind knowing that they're significantly different. And that's cool that the Cuckoo really shifts form - that's the mildest of all the differences I thought I saw anyway, there's definitely room for multiple form-changers. On that note, there's definitely room for even more, and there's totally places for The Kitsune as well. I'd go for the trickster-angle myself. I think there might also be some space in working with the idea of how Kitsunes have the ability to become non-existent people - Dopplegangers and Cuckoos (both gamewise and in their real-world/mythological counterparts) are about taking shapes of other people, while perhaps there's design space in being able to appear as whatever kind of person you want.<br/>That said, the shapeshifters+mortal group sounds so cool and I want to see that game.<br/>Oh, and I don't think I'm gonna be at this week's meetup, but I'm trying to make next week's.<br/><br/>Ben, those are awesome.

It includes Face Dancer. It's also a Microsoft Word file because my InDesign trial ran out, but it's still pretty good looking.<br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g9zpdgm4rw87qs9/The%20Doppleganger%20Word.docx" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/g9zpdgm4rw87qs9/The%20Doppleganger%20Word.docx</a><br/><br/>So, I somehow forgot to come back here. We totally played and Morgan there did indeed play The Doppleganger! It was very successful, with some interesting observations. For one, Paul, your Face Dancer move was instantly a hit with pretty much everyone who read it and they thought it definitely fixed some issues in an interesting way, so thank you very much.<br/>Other thoughts: Morgan chose My Evil Twin with intention to try abusing it - I mean, getting people blamed for stuff for XP? Sounds fairly easy when you can BE people, right? Turns out it's actually tougher than it sounds, but in a good way, worth investing energy into while not abusable.<br/>A couple memorable Doppleganger moments from the game included:<br/>* The Doppleganger using an imitation Facebook account of the Queen that had some of her clique on it to impersonate her even without transforming. (Also made me think that the Crawl Inside Your Head question would be well spent asking for Facebook or email passwords).<br/>* The Werewolf (played by me) bullying The Doppleganger in art class and events pushing me into Darkest Self, during which I started going at him in half-and-half wolf form in front of the class. In response, The Doppleganger transformed into me, also in half-wolf form. Crazy and awesome PvP wolf fight. I totally won, that move for getting Strings on people when you do harm was very very helpful, plus it turns out the Werewolf is better at hurting things, but it ended up being quite thematically appropriate - even when he transforms into an exact copy of them, he's still not as good as them.<br/>Important Note: We decided on an impromptu basis that yeah, The Doppleganger could totally become The Werewolf even if it wasn't previously established - the Werewolf's Backstory said he wasn't very subtle, so we just went with it, and the game was better for being liberal about it.<br/><br/>But then! Time passed and the next time I showed up to SGO I played Monsterhearts again! In fact, I didn't just play, I ran my first ever game of Monsterhearts! And to my elation, one of us picked The Doppleganger! Thanks to Becka (took a guess, sorry if I got the spelling wrong <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> ) for taking a chance. She picked Linked, which was interesting to see. In my nerves of doing my first MH game I kinda forgot about it for the first half of the game, but I definitely made a thing of it in the back half, and it made things really cool. Didn't trigger the mechanical side of it, but the narrative side was cool enough. Later on she also took Walk Like You, Talk Like You, which was pretty neat as well.<br/>Once again, we had multiple moments of ad hoc "can I turn into that person?" and just saying sure, yeah. Also once again, I wasn't expecting it to happen two games in a row, but we had The Doppleganger transform into a person right in front of them. An NPC this time, but still.<br/>Interesting though, I was looking at Jackson's Cuckoo skin and it had a crossed out move about turning into people in front of them labeled as "no fun," so even if it's a common thing and is cool in gameplay, maybe it's not worth making a move out of it.<br/><br/>The big thing I got out of both games was that keeping a small limit on the number of people you can transform into isn't very interesting and I'm thinking I'll just remove it. I'm thinking just put it at "When you have a string on someone and transform into them...".<br/>And alternative idea was proposed to not have a move for transforming at all and instead making the core move about when you're pretending to be someone to other people, like when you try to deceive your subject's friends or whatever.<br/>I was made aware that I need to write more clearly about how Strings and Conditions operate when you transform. To sum it up right now, narrative situations follow your current appearance, but you're mechanically treated as having all of your Strings and Conditions as usual. I'll probably write up a bonus half-sheet to go with the skin describing my reasoning for that so it makes sense to players, since it requires a certain understanding of Strings and Conditions to make it work.<br/><br/>Anyway, just wanted to come back with an update on how the games went! I'll be running a game of Monsterhearts again at Go Play NW, so hopefully someone will pick The Doppleganger again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416481/#Comment_416481" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T09:45:40+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  9:45AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool, Max!<br/><br/>And I'm glad to hear the Face Dancer moves works as intended.

It might be more effective in a long-term game (which is, after all, how Monsterhearts is supposed to be played). I wouldn't be so sure about this one just yet, although I like the mechanical angle of focusing on the interactions with other characters when impersonating someone over focusing on the transformation itself.

In my own reading of the Cuckoo, they're noticeably different feeling, but I'm definitely excited to see them on the table some time.\n<blockquote>- being able to transform should require something like a sympathetic token and/or an expenditure of a String in my opinion.  It's a powerful ability and shouldn't come without a cost, plus watching them maneuver to get such a token provides great opportunities for interesting RP. That, or spending a String showing that you're using what you know about them to aid you in this process. </blockquote>\nAn interesting idea, but I'm not so sure about a full <i>cost</i>, precisely. In the past I considered sympathetic tokens, but I'm not sure that having a token of them means at all the same thing as knowing them - and in fact strays much much closer to the Cuckoo. Spending a string is an okay idea, but I'm not entirely sure that spending a string and then having to roll anyway is so great. Instead what I've got in mind is that you need to have a string on them, but you don't need to spend it to be able to roll. Transforming sounds powerful, but since once you're them you still need to do all the rolls and everything to complete your mischief it isn't quite as tough as you might think. The risk/cost comes from the inherent risk that comes whenever you roll I guess. And for that fun RPing opportunity, instead of where you spend a string, it's the case of trying to GET that string.\n<blockquote>- I am not sure how this would work with Conditions. The other character's Conditions should apply to The Doppelganger if they've taken that character's form (The Doppelganger after all wasn't the one labeled a slut or humiliated by Shut Someone Down) except for perhaps drained and terrified. In general, I am curious to know about Strings, Conditions, etc. And also what happens if/when they get caught!</blockquote>\nThis is a thing I actually have thought a lot about. See, the Cuckoo makes a split with Conditions, dividing them into social conditions (like <i>slut</i> or <i>humiliated</i>) and physical conditions about your state of being (like <i>drained</i> or <i>terrified</i>). When you transform as a Cuckoo, you adopt their social conditions, but not the physical ones, as you suggest.<br/>I don't quite agree, and I think this is where my particular understanding of Conditions come into play. In my understanding, with the exception of drained, Conditions are a list of things that you care about. When the Queen gets labeled by the school bully as a <i>slut</i>, that's significant because the Queen cares about that label - people can take advantage of it because it's a point of emotional weakness for her. The physical truth of the matter doesn't matter; she could sex up the whole damn football team and if she's shameless about it and doesn't care about being called a slut, taking  advantage of it gives no benefit, and is not a condition. Even strictly physical matters follow this "care about" trend. If I've got the condition <i>covered in pig's blood</i>, I'm not easy to take advantage of because of the blood, but because I care that the blood is there. If I'm entirely nonchalant and don't give a fuck about this blood all over me, you can't really leverage that over me to take advantage of me, and thus it isn't a condition. Conditions are things we care about. Drained is an exception because it is explicitly about a physical truth of the situation, you can get there through taking Harm, it's more than just a feeling. It's also the only exception I can think of.<br/>With that in mind, if The Doppleganger, who idolizes the Queen, transforms into her, it doesn't automatically matter to her that others think she's a slut. You idolize her, that part included! Her emotional vulnerabilities don't suddenly become yours just because you look like her now. As such, even those social conditions don't affect you when you transform, unlike the Cuckoo. (I think it's also fitting, as the cuckoo is taking their shape out of envy, and thus doesn't have that inherent idolization that overwrites people's flaws in your eyes - even if you want their stuff, you'll still care about being called a slut).<br/>Also, Linked can make it so that when you become them, you DO feel the shame over some of it, so you can totally still tell that story.<br/><br/>Strings are a different matter, but some of the same basic reasoning follows. Here's the law to the approach I'm using: <b>narrative situations follow your shape, mechanical situations are tied to the players.</b> An important thing to this approach is the fact that strings are not tied to the situation they arise from. Once they're created, they become purely mechanical tokens until they're reintroduced to the fiction through a different action. If you help me out and I owe you a favor now and you take a String on me, you can call in that favor without spending the String, or you could spend the String and still have that favor waiting. Because they're separate, that means that it's not bizarre mechanically to be able to spend Strings from other forms.<br/>Let's talk first about spending Strings on others from different forms. Strings are emotional leverage on someone. That's what I've typically described them as. If I have leverage over someone, I know their issues, I know how to take advantage of them. Regardless of what shape I'm in, I still have that knowledge. If I know I can control you with threats of physical violence, that knowledge is a narrative situation that doesn't change with my shape, so I could still use that as my action to spend a String. However, if you owe me a favor and I take another form, the narrative situation follows my shape still, so I can't cash in my original form's favors, so that's not a reasonable way to spend a String. The third path to this is if I'm in another form, why can't I spend THEIR Strings? If I know you owe them a favor, and I'm in their shape, that's a narrative situation I can take advantage of since it follows my shape. I could even use that as an excuse to spend my own Strings, and then they wouldn't be able to cash in that favor again later. However, because Strings aren't tied to situations, I couldn't actually reach over and use any of their Strings.<br/>So what about having Strings spent on ME? Again, narrative follows shape, mechanics follow players. If I'm The Queen, and someone tries to cash in a favor the Queen owes them, they can't spend a String on me - it's not ME who they've got any sort of emotional leverage on. They can try to cash the favor in still, they just can't give it any mechanical weight. If the person has any emotional leverage on my original form though, well, I'm still vulnerable to that person, regardless of what form I'm in, so they can spend Strings they have on me. For this same reason, if they push on me and get new Strings on me, I'm the one who they have emotional control over. <br/><br/>Essentially, both of these things rely on an interpretation of Conditions as "Things about me I feel ashamed of or vulnerable for" and Strings as "Emotional leverage", not as physical or social truths and actual favors. This is my reasoning for treating Conditions and Strings this way, and I definitely plan on explaining it in an additional page page packed in with the Skin.<br/>(cont. next post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416508/#Comment_416508" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T15:01:31+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  3:01PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cont. from prev. post)\n<blockquote>- One thing that could be interesting is adding a Move that lets you add 1 to any roll against a person you share a String against in common with your current form. For example, The Vampire and The Doppelganger both have a String against The Mortal. The Doppelganger takes The Vampire's form and is able to add 1 to their roll against The Mortal. Does that make sense? Since they both share emotional leverage, The Doppelganger could use what they know as well as the fact that they're currently in the form of someone else who has some sort of pull/hold on them. Just a thought.</blockquote>\nI like this! Especially if I remove another move for some reason, this is a great contender for an additional move - I just feel a little concerned about bloating the Skin up with too many moves. Definitely a great contender though.\n<blockquote>- Would be neat to see a Move allowing for some sort of benefit if another character is in collusion with you.</blockquote>\nFace Dancer is already sort of this, but on a player scale rather than a character scale. An interesting idea, but I'm not quite as compelled as by that other Strings move, and if I'm limited on space I'd pick the other one. Still, a good idea, and a neat mental exercise, though I'm not quite sure how I would model it.\n<blockquote>- Something I might do is give other players a chance to roll with Dark to see if they can see through the disguise. If their roll fails, maybe you can carry one forward while in your current form against them or something?</blockquote>\nThis one, though, I'm not so sure about. Especially given the fact that unless you're 7-9 with the 'imperfect' choice, the disguise is pretty much perfect, I like that the only real way to figure it out is through your actions and what you do. Also, I'm not a big fan of forcing OTHER people to roll really since failure on rolls inherently causes Hard Moves, which is pretty nasty.\n<blockquote>The mention of The Doppelganger using the fake Facebook account and the suggestion that they could be in their own form and pretend to be someone they're not ("You the new intern?" "Totally.") gives me ideas for some interesting Moves to play a different kind of Doppelganger. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Overall, a pretty nifty concept that could make a good addition to a game.</blockquote>\nThanks!

So I wrote a new blog post, and mostly it's literally copy-and-pasting discussion from this thread just so any non-SG'ers can read the recent developments. Honestly, there's no reason you need to read it but I'll <a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/2013/06/monsterhearts-design-doppleganger-v3.html" rel="nofollow">LINK IT ANYWAY</a>.<br/><br/>Aside from including Version 3 and the recent discussion, the one new thing in that post is some Alternate or Experimental Moves for the Skin! I'll C&amp;P them all over here.<br/><br/>"As-is, the Skin is playable, well thought out, and fun in games, so as far as I'm concerned, it's hit the point that everything now is experimental.\n<blockquote><b>Transform:</b> You can transform into any character you have a String on. When you transform, roll with Dark. On a 10 up, you take their form perfectly. On a 7-9, choose one:<br/>        * Your impersonation won't hold up under scrutiny. <br/>        * The process is agonizing, take 1 Harm. OR * The process is slow and agonizing.<br/>        * The disguise won't last long.</blockquote>\n<i>This is alternate because:</i> It's an experimental version of Transform, but is the most likely alternate move to make it into the playbook. The alternative choice there takes the one option with a mechanical penalty (and thus is less likely to be selected) and makes it into something purely narrative but still keeps the "penalty" feeling. I'm kinda leaning toward it.\n<blockquote><b>Transformed:</b> You can transform into any character you have a String on. When you act in a way that's out of character for the person you're impersonating, roll with Dark. On a 10 up, you get away with it. On a 7-9, you raise suspicion that something's wrong and need to adjust your performance or your cover is blown.</blockquote>\n<i>This is alternate because:</i> It's very experimental, and I'm way less sure about the mechanical execution, so there's some of my own fault there, not in the approach. It has the benefit of being about the social interaction itself, which is cool. I'm on the fence, but it's definitely an interesting alternative to consider.\n<blockquote><b>Mutual Enemy:</b> When both you and the character you're impersonating have a String on someone, you take +1 to all rolls against this character.</blockquote>\n<i>This is alternate because:</i> It's a cool idea, and honestly this would be a great inclusion if I end up cutting any of the moves I already have. I just consider each of my existing moves to be slightly stronger than it, and I don't want to have too many moves on the Skin (I already have like 8 with Face Dancer).\n<blockquote><b>Conspirators:</b> While transformed, when another character knows who your really are, they may mark experience if they agree to not expose you. If they do, take a String on them.</blockquote>\n<i>This is alternate because:</i> It's a pretty hard-to-gauge trigger, and the mechanism has huge overlap with Face Dancer. It's the character-side mirror to Face Dancer, and frankly, I think just Face Dancer is enough. However, if you don't want to have that meta-gamey "work with me here and it'll be worth your while" conversation and have the interaction be in character, you could go with this one.\n<blockquote><b>Personality Bleed:</b> When you return to your own form, ask what the highest stat was for the character you were impersonating (ask the MC if it was an NPC). Until you next Transform, whenever you would roll with that stat, roll with Dark instead. </blockquote>\n<i>This is alternate because:</i> I'm hesitant about what is more or less an unconditional stat substitution. It puts a very high emphasis on Dark, and makes you use Dark even when the fiction says you should be being Hot or whatever. It's not because of the way you do it or anything, it isn't really tied to the fiction as much anymore. However, it is definitely a hell of a lot simpler than the current Personality Bleed, and that's a huge benefit since the current Personality Bleed is more inelegant than I'd like.<br/><br/>How's it looking?

Some quick comments, just brainstorming:<br/><br/>I like the more fiction-oriented aspect of the new Transform. However, it could also be kind of meaningless anytime the character has plenty of time to transform. I'll provide another alternative, just for fun:<br/><br/>* The transformation has an unintended side effect <br/><br/>Harm would, of course, be an option here.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of things like: "Hey, Luke! Good to see you... hey, wait: why are you limping?"<br/><br/>Something which gives us another conversational topic, in other words: you look just like the person you're impersonating, but you've got some new thing to explain away, as well. This element will arouse suspicion only later, when the *real* person shows up (without this characteristic). "Oh, is your foot better now?" "Huh?"<br/><br/><i>Mutual Enemy</i> is interesting, but I'm not sure what the point is. (It's not easy to track, and all it does is give a mechanical bonus.) I guess the idea is that you will want to impersonate people who have Strings on your "target", but that's not something your character knows - it's purely meta. What about gaining a temporary String on the character instead, which lasts until you transform again? That's like a +1forward, although a little more flexible.<br/><br/><i>Conspirators</i> is an interesting idea, but I still like Face Dancer better. Conspirators has the advantages you describe, but it doesn't solve the problem that Face Dancer was designed for in the first place: how do reconcile the different knowledge of the player (who knows for a fact that the character is not really who they seem) and the character (who doesn't). That player is constantly wondering, "Is it fair play for me to just say, 'Hey, you're not really Cordelia, are you?'" The Face Dancer move gives them permission to do so, and a carrot not to. Conspirators still leaves that difficult decision without any support. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I could see using both moves in tandem.<br/><br/>As for <i>Personality Bleed</i>, I still like it for its simplicity. Your new version is even simpler and easier than mine, but perhaps over-powered: a transformed Doppleganger now potentially has uber-stats, whereas in mine it would be likely that in the transformed state, the Doppleganger would no longer be as connected to the abyss (as they might not be able to use their Dark stat very easily anymore, if it was swapped for a "lousy" stat). I like the thematic implications of that: when I'm myself, I have high Dark but low Hot. When I turn into the popular girl, I am Hot... but I am no longer Dark until I switch back.<br/><br/>The simplicity is nice, though. One alternative I can see would be just giving the Doppleganger a lower stat block to begin with, kind of like the Driver in Apocalypse World: you have an advantage when you're transformed but you're <i>less than them</i> when you're yourself.<br/><br/>On all the other points, I agree with your comments (both good and bad).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430139/#Comment_430139" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T00:36:31+00:00" title="March 28, 2014 12:36AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, finally pulled all my stuff together having played it one more time and made it into a proper, professional-looking PDF, right off the Monsterhearts Skin Template.
