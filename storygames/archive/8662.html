I do this partially because I know that people love tinkering with games and I'd like to give 'em some support for that, but also because it explains a lot about the structure of the game itself.  It's sort of lifting the hood and saying, "You see that thing?  It does X.  But you can swap it with Y, as long as you make sure not to take Z out with it, and the motor will still run" and stuff.<br/><br/>I came up with three examples for it:  Mosswood, Frontier Suns, and Heatwave.  Mosswood is a weird fantasy thing, Frontier Suns is a thinly-veiled Firefly rip-off, and Heatwave is a sort of slick, over-the-top, uber-stylized modern urban crimey thing.  I'm quickly falling in love with Heatwave in particular, and strongly considering making it into a supplement later.<br/><br/>Unlike Mosswood and Frontier Suns, Heatwave's stylistic considerations necessitated a complete overhaul of the attributes.  Mosswood needed only to have a few renamed, and Frontier Suns needed no change at all, but Heatwave calls for something completely different.<br/><br/>I'm very interested in the way that the terms we give things in RPGs influences the way that people play.  I tried my damnedest to make Rustbelt's attributes intuitive and explanatory, and to make them imply Setting, and I think I did a pretty good job.<br/><br/>So, as an experiment, what I'd like to do real quick is present the Heatwave attributes, with no explanation whatsoever, and I'd like you to tell me what you think they're for, how you would use them.  I already know how I intend them to work, and I'll reveal that later; I want to know what your raw impressions are.

It was just the easiest way for me to get the concept across:<br/><br/>Hard = How hard of a dude or chick you are, as in "I'm a badass drug dealer who killed my friend Wallace because Stringer Bell told me to. I am Hard."<br/>Sharp = Street smarts, intelligence<br/>Cool = How well you can keep a cool head or a low profile. Avoiding being noticed by those you want to avoid.<br/>Smooth = Charisma, fast-talk, the ability to talk people into things, get people to like you, and sound cool.<br/>Shifty = Sketchy motherfucker. Untrustworthy.<br/>Likeable = You come across as inoffensive, easy to talk to, and "normal", in the best possible way.<br/>Weird = People view you as out of the ordinary. Not necessarily bad, dangerous, or someone to avoid, but definitely left of what they consider "normal". It colors all of their interactions with you.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192154/#Comment_192154" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T15:02:20+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  3:02PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2009 2:59PM by Marshall Burns.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EDITED TO INCORPORATE NEW DATA (and stuff I missed the first time)</b><br/><br/>Okay, before I get started, lemme copy&amp;paste a reply that agony/Charles made to this same post on my forum on the Forge:<br/><br/>Hard - Physicall tough, emotionally cold, vindictive, and likely prone to anger<br/>Sharp - Strong intellect, quick wits, solid hand-eye coordination<br/>Cool - Steve McQueen<br/>Smooth - Able to talk your way out of anything, able to pick up any woman from the local bar<br/>Shifty -Cannot be trusted, easily able to disappear from sight<br/>Likeable - Able to emotionally calm someone, gain someone's trust, or just appear charismatic<br/>Weird - Complete opposite of likeable, wouldn't appear very useful except to cause you problems.<br/><br/>For example, the character Sorter from <i>Revolver</i> would be roundabout thus:<br/>Hard 4<br/>Sharp 10<br/>Cool 7<br/>Smooth 1<br/>Shifty 4<br/>Likeable 8<br/>Weird 7<br/><br/><br/>So here's the way I use these:<br/><br/><b>Hard</b>:  being physically tough and emotionally hardened; intimidating people<br/><b>Sharp</b>:  being astute, intelligent, perceptive, and dextrous<br/><b>Cool</b>:  keeping your head under fire<br/><b>Smooth</b>:  being seductive, lying effectively, fast-talking, smooth-talking, putting up a front<br/><b>Shifty</b>:  being sneaky, cagey, and underhanded<br/><b>Likeable</b>:  talking someone down, appealing to someone's better nature, making friends<br/><b>Weird</b>:  being weird, freaky, quirky, and/or unorthodox<br/><br/>Now, for each, let's do a break down of what was mostly on-target, what was close, and what was right out.<br/><br/><b>HARD</b><br/><i>on-target</i><br/>1.

"Used for violence." - Graham.  <i>Close, but most of the others can be used for violence as well; depends on how you're doing the violence</i><br/>2.

Besides, all the data is there, with complete transparency, for anyone who wants to look.<br/><br/>Now, one thing that's going on here is how you can use words that are particularly colorful, and intuitive and evocative when paired with a sparse setting/style description. But that's pretty obvious by now, right? Nobody's still giving characters stats like "Strength, Vitality, Agility, whatever" because they haven't thought to do it any other way, right?<br/><br/>Here's the other thing, and it's the really cool one. With the exception of things that make no sense with regard to the game's system ("to-hit roll" and such), <i>the definitions you guys came up with could be used without changing or breaking anything</i>.

I know he isn't so slick or modern, but he's a pretty good example of a detective-type anyway.  (Compare him to the main character in <i>Life</i>, for instance.)<br/><br/>Sharp is the one trait Dresden can consistently rely on.  His Sharp collects all his failures and dead ends and rolls them up into one big win.<br/><br/>His Smooth bottoms out: he lies so poorly he rarely bothers trying, and his constant witticisms are his way of saying "uh".<br/><br/>Despite his lack of Smooth, his basic Likeability has helped him out on occasion and in the long run, though it rankles him when he's liked by a bad guy or disliked by a good guy, and it kills him that good guys who like him get hurt.<br/><br/>His Hard is low enough to put him at a tactical disadvantage, particularly with female villains.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to say about his Cool.  His inner state can be volatile and easily manipulable.  But he is aware of that.  In the end, manipulating Dresden may be a good way to up the ante, but a bad way to bend or break his will.  But I'm not sure.  A lot of the tension in several of the books has come from whether Dresden will keep or lose his Cool in a good way or in a bad way.<br/><br/>Even without considering the supernatural, he's certainly Weird -- I mean, he still carries around a staff and charms, and he's still listed in the phone book as a wizard rather than as a detective.  That would be weird regardless.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>So it looks to me like he has one trait for the win (Sharp), two traits for falling on his face (Smooth and Hard), and two traits for inner conflict (Likeability and Cool).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193049/#Comment_193049" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T06:54:04+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  6:54AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite><i>on-target</i><br/>1.
