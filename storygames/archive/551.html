                    My head is just filled with all kinds of little ideas. Let's flush and see what floats.<br/>
<br/>
I keep going back to a dungeon idea. I don't know why, really. You'd think the concept would be all mined out. Har. Har. But I'm leaning towards something like Gauntlet: The Third Encounter for the Atari Lynx:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.ataritimes.com/lynx/reviews/gauntlet3.html<br/>
<br/>
In that one, you get to choose from several characters: Valkyrie, Wizard, Pirate, Gunfighter, Samurai, Android, Nerd, and Punkrocker. As you can see, the character types are kind of thrown together without much rhyme or reason. Every so often someone posts an idea for making a dungeon game where the whole world is a dungeon and there is no surface world to deal with, but those conversations tend to run into stuff like figuring out a realistic or at least logical ecology for a world that is totally underground. I plan to chuck logic into the garbage disposal with the grotty old potato peels. Where it belongs. <br/>
<br/>
But I also keep thinking of a dungeon card game which would be similar to several other dungeon card games out there with the difference that you don't need a large table to lay out the cards to create the maze because the maze element is handled in a more abstract way. Possibly with several piles like Solitaire. In fact you could play it solitaire or with a group                </div>

<p>In the original arcade Gauntlet, there were monster generators. You had to destroy them or they kept making monsters of a given type. That eliminates the need for an ecology.</p>
<p>I'm working on my own solitaire/collaborative roguelike dungeon crawl right now, as I've mentioned a couple times. I have slightly different design criteria.</p>

<i>"In the original arcade Gauntlet, there were monster generators. You had to destroy them or they kept making monsters of a given type. That eliminates the need for an ecology."</i><br/><br/>I see. But here's the thing. That's not really avoiding the whole ecology angle. That's coming up with a reason for why worrying about the ecology isn't something to worry about. It addresses the question.l I'm not even going to do that. That way, the players can come up with their own answers, if they decide to do so.                        </div>

                            On your maze thing: there was a game for Game Chef this year called "Colourless Green Ideas Sleep Furiously". It had a nice maze-like thing, with nine piles of cards in a 3x3 grid. Every time the player moved, the grid recentred themselves around them. That was cool.<br/>
