First, print out a bunch of transcripts of textual descriptions of combat from a computer RPG. If you've ever played WOW or Dnd Online (aw, come on, you know you have - we are all weak), it's the output that you get in the chat box that goes "You hit the demon for 7 points of damage. / The demon his you for three points of damage." Then cut them up into little strips of paper and hand them around blindly to all of the players. Your collection of these bits of paper will be your character's arsenal. Each strip is worth the number of points of damage indicated, and there are bonuses if the creature being described on the paper  resembles the one you're fighting, or penalties if it doesn't (where "resembles" stands for "a totally <i>ad hoc </i>relationship between two in-game characters, to be determined by whomever shouts the loudest").<br/><br/>By the way, for anyone else who's interested in the gaming possibilities of these sorts of artistic methods, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-Surrealist-Games-Alastair-Brotchie/dp/1570620849/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275154589&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">this</a> book is definitely worth a peek.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273590/#Comment_273590" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-29T10:54:13+00:00" title="May 29, 2010 10:54AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2010 10:56AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Outagraphy</b> is the use of a picture where the subject of that picture has been cut out, leaving only a blank space.<br/><br/>To employ this technique, go out and buy a stack of "fantasy art" collector's cards (or similar such cards of whatever genre), and a whiteout pen.

I'm writing a blog post about a surrealism-inspired technique, so I'll just cross-post it right here:<br/><br/>I have a lot of difficulty stocking dungeons, so for Go Play NW I\u2019m devising an exquisite corpse dungeon stocking technique. It works like this:<br/>Make three columns of words and phrases. Each column should have 12-20 items in it.<br/><br/>In the first column, list stuff you already know is probably going to be in your dungeon. I\u2019m doing this with microdungeons, so it\u2019s easy. I just look at the map:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.microdungeons.com/uploaded_images/Barrow_on_the_Hill-725704.jpg"/><br/> <br/>So in column 1 I put: ancestors, swords, spite, bats, visions, crypt, mural, hunger, bone pit, tomb, maze, dome, standing stones<br/>In column 2 I put thematic words, monsters, events, or themes that match the color I want my dungeon to have.<br/><br/>Column2: death, skeletons, ambush, gnawing, haunted, wailing cries, entombed, forgotten, blindness, tomb robbers, spikes, shadow<br/><br/>In column 3 I put macguffins, dungeon tricks, plot twists, and other fairly generic adventury bits.<br/><br/>Column 3: not what it seems, treasure is hidden, item is actually magic, monster wants something, treasure conceals a monster, room is cursed,  moving walls and floors, PC\u2019s ancestry is involved, swarms of monsters, monster is also a wizard, rod of paralysis, scrying magic<br/><br/>Now roll 1d10 on each column, writing down the phrases you get and crossing them off the list. The three phrases are your exquisite corpse. Write 1-2 sentences about what encounter or thing in the dungeon this corpse represents. Do this 6-10 times. Each corpse is sort of an oracle to devise one encounter.<br/><br/>So, for example: a roll of 1, 7, 2 = \u201cancestors\u201d \u2013 \u201centombed\u201d \u2013 \u201ctreasure is hidden\u201d. I decide this means that the protecting ancestral spirits who once guarded the barrow have been bound to their bones, swept into the bone pit, and magically entombed. The treasure is that if released, one of the skeleton warriors will serve a party member until destroyed. Perhaps opening the pit is quite dangerous unless the PCs can figure out the correct spell or command word.<br/><br/>Second roll: 3, 2, 3 = \u201cbats\u201d \u2013 \u201cskeleton\u201d \u2013 \u201cmonster wants something\u201d. I decide that the ghosts of lesser servants buried in the barrow have possessed the skeletons of a swarm of bats in the cave labeled bats on the map. These creatures have a mindless compulsion to complete some ancient task that may be to the PCs benefit or detriment. They will fight if prevented from completing their goal. I don\u2019t know what the goal is yet. I\u2019m going to wait until I roll some more stuff up and see something jumps out at me.<br/><br/>I've made three dungeon outlines this way, and I"m very pleased with the results!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273595/#Comment_273595" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-29T12:20:33+00:00" title="May 29, 2010 12:20PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted in a previous thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Potemkin</cite>"Cut-up gaming, eh?

Without consulting each other, on each card the players write the start of a scene using fairly broad description for the characters involved.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>A naked woman sits on a couch looking horrified down a young girl wearing a blue dress lying prone on the ground.  Over her stands a tall, older man in a sharp business suit holding a gun."<br/><br/>The index cards are shuffled.  At the start of a new scene turn one card over.  That's the next scene.  Slot in characters that match the broad descriptions either by inventing a new character or re-incorporating a character from a previous scene.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Tonight I've been thinking of using is as a table surface for minis gaming, rather than the more traditional realistic/simulation style gaming surface.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about putting your more usual terrain stuff on the surface, but now that I type this, it might be interesting to cover all sorts of stuff with the images.<br/><br/>For example, I'm puttering once again with some ideas about doing a Resistance game. I wonder what it would be like to do some really stylized building and street terrain whose outlines suggest what they are, but are covered with various printouts of period/subject appropriate photos in black and white.<br/><br/>Game function? Not sure, but I've been thinking about the multiform stuff too. Maybe just visual inspiration for more open-ended sorts of gaming?<br/><br/>Might be interesting for table set up that was movable/re-arrangable for more scene style play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
