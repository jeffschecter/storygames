I even owned ARIA). The way the rules interact with each other, the way the setup works, the way things happen... the game is only like 100 pages, but every single page is filled with little rules you have to really know deep down to play a game successfully. Literally, I can see it being a thing where you're like <br/><br/>You: "Oh, we played it, but it just didn't work right"<br/>Other: "Oh, it sounds like that you might not have been using that third rule on page 43. Was it not working for you?"<br/>You: "Which rule was that? (flip flip flip... read read read...) Aw, fuck".<br/><br/>It is tight. There is no wasted space. And yet, this is probably going to be a game where a friend will have to read it through and run it for me (or perhaps like 5 friends each "MASTER" 1/5 of the book, then come together to play).<br/><br/>It's that complicated. To me, anyway. Complication is enhanced by the fact that these aren't "side rules" like radiation and suffocation in high gravity, they're all core rules, and they all currently make sense. There's just a lot to always, Always have in your head.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94300/#Comment_94300" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T04:26:10+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  4:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, let me get this straight. All of you are cultists, looking for a way to master the dark forces so as to achieve your lifelong goal. If you win, you get to see the other players fail (narrate how they fail?), and there's only one shot that one of the group will actually get that chance. And you do not play "together" as characters, although you can, because you can play at different points in history. Yet, the more you advance, the more you can interact as the walls of time and space start falling down for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you do <b>awful</b> things to get ahead. When you're breaking down the barriers of reality, NO price is too high, not for your goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay...during character creation, is it discussed how your characters interact with each other? Or does it come up during play, and the GM basically sets up how one character is opposed to the others?<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume that actual magic/supernatural elements occur during play. How are they handled? Is it basically narrated Color constrained by the success/failure of the rolls?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis pretty much has to be a long-term experience to get the feel of it, right? It won't shine during a one-shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Corinne" title="Corinne"><img alt="Corinne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Corinne">Corinne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94338/#Comment_94338" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T09:06:39+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:06AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It gathers speed over the long haul, that's for sure.<br>\n<br>\nAs for how the players interact, that's built into the system.  As occultists, other players are your natural rivals.  And rivalry is a huge part of the game.  Just the same, if you can dominate another player's character, you can force them into the role of your Underling...and Underlings are one of the most precious commodities in AOE (my strategy whenever is I play is to establish an Underling as quickly as I can).  And sometimes these interactions won't be your choice at all...you get to pick (scene by scene) what types of characters you want to interact with (you might say, for instance, "I want a scene with a Rival."), but the GM populates the scene  with characters of the specified type from the available pool (so, for instance, because all player characters start out as Rivals, any PC in your current time frame, or any PC at all with the ability to transcend time and/or space, could end up in your scene).<br>\n<br>\nOn a non-character level, there are shared creations within the game - notably the settings and some of the NPCs - and you'll have opportunities to mess with these too, creating further interactive overlap.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding magic, a lot of it is Color...constrained in broadly defined categories.  But magical workings themselves are a specific kind of action too, with mechanical consequences and whatnot.  You'll like it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94357/#Comment_94357" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T10:10:32+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 10:10AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note: These are impressions from reading the ashcan (just finished doing so perhaps an hour ago), not playing.<br><br>The point of the game is genius.  There's no other way to say it - if Acts of Evil (either as it is currently or in any future iteration) delivers on its core promise, then it's quite possibly the most masterfully-designed game of all time.  I don't want to spoil the big surprise for those who haven't read it, but Acts of Evil is built in hopes of achieving a very specific emergent property of play that I see as seriously mind-blowing.<br><br>The big problem is that "if."  The mechanics are, as Andy noted, very complicated.  In some ways, this little 90-page book is more complex than the D&amp;D3.5 Player's Handbook.  Forgetting even one of the myriad rules and the ways they interact seems like it could bring the whole thing tumbling down.  From reading the ashcan, it sounds like its been a complicated and difficult journey for Paul, too, trying to wrestle the mechanics into doing what he needs them to do.<br/><br/>Basically, I think Acts of Evil is the perfect example of an ashcan, and what the Front is for.  There's huge potential there, but it seems like it's not quite there yet.  If a version of the game that achieves its design goals results from feedback from the ashcan, then that'll be a huge vindication for the Ashcan Front.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94414/#Comment_94414" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T13:22:05+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  1:22PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Corinne</cite>Several years ago I read A Simple Plan.

I didn't know that it had been talked about in other threads already.<br/><br/>The big surprise is that at some point towards the end of gameplay, one of the recurring NPCs should stand up in some significant way and get in the way of (or even halt) the ambitions of one or more of the occultists.  And usually make a sacrifice in doing so.  This is meant to signify that this NPC (or NPCs, if more than one of them manages it) was actually the protagonist all along, and the occultists were just the villains of the piece.  Additionally, even if you do ascend to godhood, it turns out that what that really consists of is destroying and usurping an uber-predator microorganism from Earth's prehistory.<br/><br/>It's a very interesting twist, and an equally interesting design goal for emergent gameplay.  If it works, it's quite the accomplishment.<br/><br/>Note, this shouldn't be surprising for anyone who's read the book.

At least one player, maybe more but probably not all of them, will win this right, and then they get to propose a starting setting.  Players who don't get to create a setting pick one for their characters to start out in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is all very relevant, because how you choose to bid has the potential to carryover to one of your character's starting "attributes", and winning definitely has a benefit, but it has disadvantages too...for instance, if your setting is so cool everyone wants to play in it, you'll find yourself up against a whole bunch of self-aggrandizing rivals right off the bat.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter creation emerges directly from the setting creation.  You figure out what your starting setpiece is, and then you imagine the kind of character you'd most like to play in that setting.  The nuts &amp; bolts of chargen are pretty straightforward...you divvy up some points among your various aspects (knowing the game and what does what really helps here), give some broad description, and your ready to go.  But there's a natural tension that emerges among the players - and I think the setting creation really winds this up - to make something cool, offbeat, and original.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes you hit paydirt right away, like with the baby in Hiroshima.  Sometimes it takes a scene or two for your character to really hit its stride.  My very first character was a s&amp;m freak in post-Revolutionary France; not exactly original, I know, but within a scene or two he decided to shave his eyebrows, believing they were the betrayers of some inner conscience, and instead took to painting eyebrows onto his face (once, memorably, using his own excrement because it was all he had handy) to reveal to onlookers how he thought he should feel.  That character was not easily forgotten after that, and the point is, that was the game in action...I was fetishizing my character to gain extra dice, but in the process, I was creating a really villainous villain and developing a myth worthy of a usurper god all at the same time.  And fetishizing is the most basic and easy example to give, but literally every scene you have and every thing you do adds to your character's mythology.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat other sites will you see along the way?  Hard to say...anything's feasible.  In the same game as my s&amp;m freak, one of the other players got stranded on Mars (I think it was Mars, anyway) and was permanently rendered into a statue of unmelting ice.  They were then forced to build a cult from the strange cat-like creatures who gathered at its base, drawn to the cooler temperatures like an oasis in a desert.  It was a little more Edgar Rice Burroughs than Clive Barker, but it was weird and not without a certain creepiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think probably my favorite aspect of AOE is that it's deliberately structured to be non-linear.  I'm not talking about having some scenes broken up by flashbacks, or anything like that.  Literally, every scene you have can take place in a different time and location, unconnected to previous scenes in time and/or content, because there is no need for rigid continuity (although you can have it if you want).  Time and time again I've heard people say things like "You know the cover of [insert name of favorite game]...I want a game that recreates that!".  More than any other game I know, AOE fulfills that promise, because although each scene is building towards something big, it's also its own self-contained portrait...as beautiful and terrible and grand as you choose to make it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94869/#Comment_94869" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T17:01:43+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  5:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, so you can "weird up" your character for bonus points, eh?

There's a risk involved, and an incentive for taking it.  It's not necessary for ascension, but the benefit is worthwhile.  Speaking on my own here, I think it's a cool mechanic, but the last version I playtested (back in May) didn't have it, and being that it's tied into the game's big "twist", it's going to need to be put to through its paces (over multiple sessions, that is).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95224/#Comment_95224" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T14:10:37+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  2:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I borrowed the ashcan from Michael Miller. <br/><br/>This is good.
