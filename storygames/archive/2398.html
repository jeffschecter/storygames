                    So I wanted to share this because it was pushing to get out of my head. I'm not sure how insightful it is.<br/><br/>When I started playing rpgs, in or around 1980, we were aware of two games: AD&amp;D and Traveller. But we played AD&amp;D and never played Traveller. <br/><br/>Now we tried rolling some Traveller characters, and the whole life path approach really sparked ideas for us as to who are characters were, but we could never figure out how to play Traveller.<br/><br/>By contrast AD&amp;D was easy. You drew up a dungeon on graph paper, picked some denizens out of the monster manual to occupy the rooms, rolled some characters, and were good to go. The game came with a lot of helpers to play this way. Levels made it easy to work out what denizens were appropriate. Treasure tables let us figure out the rewards. There were plenty of rules to cover adjudicate the common things that could happen like falling into a pit.<br/><br/>AD&amp;D was  a game that told you how to play it. By contrast while Traveller had mechanics it did not have much advice on how to set up and play a game. So we played it less. <br/><br/>Published AD&amp;D modules were great both as examples, and because they were usually better that what we came up with. Their dungeons were cohesive rather than random and progressing through them seemed to build toward a climax.<br/><br/>Games might differ in mechanics and setting but we tended to favour that dungeon style of play because it was easy. Even when we played RuneQuest with its rich setting of Glorantha, it was really just a backdrop to dungeon crawls.<br/><br/>It seemed that GDW had the same issue as because most of its early packaged modules were just dungeon crawls (The Kinunir, Research Station Gamma). It was a long time before we got anything that told us how to run a game that did not take place in the dugeon. The Keith brothers wrote scenarios that had chapters and scenes and later on we had Book 0 to tell us how to play. We also had ideas like 76 patrons where we had a crisis to throw at the players and improvised the session around it. Eventually Traveller ended up with the nugget system, and instead of a drawing out series of rooms, we sketched out a series of scenes. In time we figured out how to run a game.<br/><br/>Re-reading Sorceror recently (prior to running a game of Dictionary of Mu) I was struck by how much time Ron takes to tell you how to set up your Sorceror game. A narrativist equivalent of the advice AD&amp;D gave us on how to create a dungeon. Ron tells us how to play a game of Sorceror. <br/><br/>By contrast when Hero Wars came out I think that some of its poor reception (beyond the editing) was due to fact that it did not have enough obvious advice on how to set up your Hero Wars game and play it. There were example adventures and talk about community threats and heroquests but no real advice on how to create a successful game. Interestingly I tend to use a similar format for HeroQuest games. Create a community and drive that community in crisis. I wonder how much more broadly popular HeroQuest might have been if it had included suggestions on how to run a game. Did it make Traveller's mistake.<br/><br/>I wonder if some of the success of indie games is that they tell us how to play the game. Dogs in the Vineyard shows us how to set up a town. My Life with Master, Burning Empires all tell us how to play the game.<br/><br/>Maybe there is some predjudice against role-playing having a 'game' element to it. Looking at some of the reaction to Burning Empires on rpg.net I do wonder that. Gamers seem to have priviledged the notion of 'open' games that do not prescribe a 'way to play', but 'closed' games that contain a formula for a play session do seem to have more success. <br/><br/>Surely the continued attraction of the dungeon (D20, Castles and Crusades) proves that it is easier to play games that come with a formula to run a successful game even if they are more limited in scope than an open-ended game that a lot of people find too confusing, and to time consuming to set up and use.                </div>

                            I'd say that's a valid insight. The dungeon crawl is definitely a simple and compelling setup for an RPG, and translates to many other areas as well (think about how many dungeon-crawl computer games there are). By providing a "game formula", it is easier for beginners to put together a game.<br/><br/>There is a downside, though. The 1st time you go into a dungeon, it's amazingly cool. The 20th time is a lot less interesting. The focus of the game also becomes it's limitation, especially when the story you want to tell goes outside what the rules of the game support.<br/><br/>This is an issue I have with a number of indie games. Many of them focus on a very specific story structure. It is easy to get into them quickly, but after I've played them a few times I start to see the same elements appearing over and over again.<br/><br/>There seems to be a trend in many of the indie-gamers I know to play a game a few times and move onto another game. They treat RPGs more like board games, where you play a one-shot or a brief campaign then do something else, occassionally returning to old favorites. This isn't necessarily an invalid way of playing, but it is different from what I've come to expect from the months-long campaigns of more traditional RPGs.                        </div>

                            This is an interesting topic and one that I've been thinking about lately as well.  I have a gaming friend at work who has been experimenting with some indie narrativist games with me even though his usual group plays more of the D&amp;D/d20 games.  The other week he told me that we wanted to run something a little bit different with them and the response was "it's been a hard week and we don't want to have to think too much".  So he ran a dungeon crawl.  The "box" was there, they understood the limitations of the box, but at the time were perfectly happy with what they were getting.<br/><br/>I think some of this might be mood and investment.  When I want to run a game that takes a lot of player investment like MLWM or Contenders, there needs to be a certain amount of player energy and investment at the table.  If the energy isn't there, the game usually falls flat.<br/><br/>An interesting space between these two extremes I've been seeing is the demo con scenarios for indie games.  You can be intimidated as hell about the Burning Wheel rules (as many are), but when you sit players down with 'The Sword' and they see pre-gens and when the GM notes that they will only be exposed to certain rule sets since it's "just a demo", I see much less intimidation at the table and more of a tendency to go with it.<br/><br/>Paul, not to bend Ian's thread.  But I get the sense that a lot of indie games really are built around one-shots and mini-campaigns of 2-5 sessions.  The subject matter is usually very pointed and the mechanics are built specifically to drive a certain type of thematic play.  I don't get the sense that a lot of them were really designed to support long-form play.  And personally I think that this short-form play style is a direct response to the two-year dungeon crawls and never-ending campaigns that many of us were exposed to in the past.<br/><br/>It's not good or bad; it's just different.  I spent my entire college career playing only 2 or 3 games (AD&amp;D, Traveller, Boot Hill) and had fun.  But I ran or played at least eight different games in 2006 alone and a learned a lot from each one.                        </div>

                            Thanks for the comments guys.<br/><br/>I wonder whether the 'long' game is a turn-off for many people and the reason for the popularity of games like 'AD&amp;D' was the limited scope, the sense of having 'completed' when the dungeon or adventure was finished.<br/><br/>We identify 'long-term' play as somehow more to be desired, a higher form. But I'm wondering if it is actually more niche and that the broader public want something that feels like a game with a setup, play period, and conclusion instead of being 'endless'.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed running long campaigns. But I get the feeling more and more that a limited game has some advantages in time and effort required to set up and in commitment to finish.                        </div>

                            Ian, I'm looking at the same issue. I think that if you want to run pickup games, It's imperative to have a couple of generic siturations (such as a dungeon crawl and a journey) with enough worked out in case you need the game to run itself for you. I'm talking encounter tables or lists, pregen characters (even if they're just NPC's). This might be sacrilege, but there is something very nice about the 'GM as referee'. I think it also applies to players, to pick a fighter, and just go along for the ride untill you find the character's 'thing'                        </div>

                            Hmm. Interesting points about long-term vs. short-term play. I definitely prefer long-term play. I've been doing a lot more one-shot games lately, mostly indie-games at our local gaming store, and have enjoyed them grealy. I still prefer longer games, though, both as a player and as a GM. I need time to get into the heads of my characters and for a situation for it to feel "real" to me. I do agree that long vs. short games is a matter of taste.<br/><br/>I think the real reason why limited-form games like dungeon crawls and focused-narrative indie-games are successful is not that they are easier to <b>play</b>, but that they are easier to <b>run</b>. Dungeon crawls making GMing formuliac and most indie-games have very low setup times.<br/><br/>In my experience, new players have very little problem with open-ended games, since they don't have any idea about what the game is supposed to be like anyway. I've have more difficulty getting my experienced players to unlearn their expectations than getting the newer players to adopt strange ideas or teaching them how to play.                        </div>

                            Ian, you've described to a "t" my experience with <i>Traveller</i> as a kid. I thought it was the coolest thing since sliced bread, but I could never figure out what the heck I was supposed to do with it. Contrast this to <i>Star Frontiers</i>, which had a very clear setup ("You work for Star Law!") and came with an introductory adventure... that was basically a dungeon-crawl. We got multiple replays out of that product.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ian Cooper</cite>I wonder if some of the success of indie games is that they tell us how to play the game.</blockquote>
I think it's one of the many reasons. At the heart of the indie design movement (well, the Forge-inspired sector, for sure) is this baseline assumption that, yes, everything starts with a bunch of people sitting around a table, and we need to talk to them before we worry about mechanics and genre. Interestingly, I think this is filtering into the mainstream design community as well; I'd offer <i>Spycraft 2.0</i> as an example.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ian Cooper</cite>Maybe there is some predjudice against role-playing having a 'game' element to it. Looking at some of the reaction to Burning Empires on rpg.net I do wonder that.</blockquote>
Chis Chinn once pointed out on his blog the idea that there are gamers who approach RPGs with an attitude of "Let's see what this RPG does"; and then there are gamers (the majority) who approach with an attitude of "I already know how to play and what I want; can this RPG do that?"<br/><br/>Indie games seem to embrace the former attitude, and thus I can see them putting off gamers with the latter. My HERO group had exactly this reaction to BW/BE. DoW "got in the way of the roleplaying" and Infection "sounds too much like an RTS game." Basically, "This RPG isn't giving me exactly what I already expect the gaming experience to be."<br/><br/>My attitude has shifted so much to the former that I don't even really understand most "Sell me on..." and "Can system X do [genre]?" threads anymore. They seem predicated on the ideas that a) the player has already decided what the game needs to "be," and b) that genre/setup has anything to do with whether the game uses, e.g., 3d6-roll-under or d20-roll-over in its mechanic.<br/><br/>I mean, over on ENWorld, I see discussions of what d20 can "do" all the time. All I can think now is, "If you want the game focused on tactics, resource management, task resolution, and combat... yeah, d20 can do whatever genre/setting you want." It seems to me that the far more important question gamers should be asking is whether or not they <i>want</i> a game focused on tactics, resource management, task resolution, and combat. The genre trappings of the Color seem pretty irrelevant to me.                        </div>

Yep, I'm loving the short-term approach of many indie games. I'm trying to integrate it into my mainstream stuff I most often play.<br/><br/>I'm in three regular groups. One group has done nothing but play a single D&amp;D campaign for going on four years now. This is the first and only group I've ever been in that's done this. <br/><br/>My HERO group started off with a single campaign, and we have been playing for 3-4 years now, but we also started rotating in other campaigns. I'm running a Star HERO game right now that, from the outset, I announced was not going to run longer than about six sessions; an unprecedented thing in this group.<br/><br/>My other D&amp;D group has yet to "complete" anything. We have maybe eight campaigns, among various d20 systems, that have been started, but never brought to any real conclusion. The "main" game right now is <i>Age of Worms</i>. Given our schedule (and how often we take "breaks" to switch to other campaigns), it'll take us about three years or so to complete the whole path. IMO, this is just a ridiculous commitment. <br/><br/>That said, we're currently running through a mini-campaign using <i>Expedition to Castle Ravenloft</i> that the DM slated to last no longer than five sessions. It's been a blast, and a much better fit for our group's ability to commit to games.                        </div>

                            One point that I haven't seen in this thread is that dungeons lend an serial structure to long-term play.  Sure, you can play D&amp;D for months or years, but that months-long play is divided into relatively discrete chunks called "dungeons" (or "adventures").  Maybe the wiley GM threads a recurring badguy or giant conspiracy into those dungeons, maybe you're tracking down and exterminating some spider-cult that's sprung up in a number of places.  The important thing, though, is that at the end of every dungeon the players (including the GM) feel some measure of accomplishment -- they have done something, and they have <em>finished</em> something.  Now they'll move on to another relatively discrete thing.  For my money, this is what fuels the months-long games - there is a reward cycle at work every session or every couple of sessions that tells the players "you won today" and holds out the possibility that there's another dungeon just over the horizon that they can beat tomorrow.                        </div>

It also fits very well with some source material, like the old Fafyrd and Grey Mouser stories that Gygax used to reference as a counter-point to the Tolkienish Urge. To some degree, it also fits with some older style of comic books. I may be wrong on this point, but didn't comics in the 1960s and 1970s tend to be self-contained issues, with only the rare comic that had a two or three part story arc? Sure, you had recurring villains, and sometimes back referencing, but nothing on par with more modern comics with their very lengthy arcs and near soap opera style on-going stories.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>The important thing, though, is that at the end of every dungeon the players (including the GM) feel some measure of accomplishment -- they have done something, and they have<em>finished</em>something.

Indeed, I think on both sides, GM and player, the urge to have moments of 'completion' is very strong and the discrete adventure or crisis (in terms of playing with an R Map) does give that.                        </div>

                            Indie games are the new oldschool, I often think that.<br/><br/>Back in the day, when I bought a game, I bought all that I needed for play.  The assumption was I had a full game there, realised because some guy much like me thought it was cool and had access to a printer.<br/><br/>Now, sometimes that game was not as complete as it could have been, sometimes some bits of it were kind of funky even, but what I bought was still a labour of love that gave me the power to take that game and run it and have a blast.<br/><br/>Indie gaming has far more in common with say Tunnels &amp; Trolls or LBB Traveller than it does with what came later, that's why I still check it out on occasion.  It's where the old school vibe is these days.<br/><br/>With the early rpgs I bought, some 25+ or so years ago now, I knew what to do when I opened the box.  I went into dungeons, fought cultists, traded in space empires.  The game told me how to play and what experience I would get from playing it.  <br/><br/>Dogs offers that same benefit.<br/><br/>That said, for me Traveller offered that just as much as D&amp;D, but that's detail and individual inspiration, I think the broader point is spot on.<br/><br/>Oh, this seems very close to the core narrative concept that I've seen Mike Mearls (I think it was him) talking about as one of the core strengths of D&amp;D.  Essentially, that a game with a core narrative, a core play experience, provides support that really helps play and makes it accessible.  With time you can springboard off that to do other stuff, but the core narrative is still there to support you when you need it.<br/><br/>D&amp;D has that, so I think probably does Sorceror, Blue Planet not so much.<br/><br/>Obviously by the way I'm using narrative here in a general, not GNS, sense.                        </div>

                            Yeah, good cite Max. Another game that nailed this down was Paranioa. Instead of the dungeon to inform the standard narrative, there's a plot cycle that you tend to go through with each mission in Paranioa (wake up, briefing, gear up, hit field, debrief, and all of he transit stages between each).<br/>
<br/>
So we can see the effective methods that have been generated over the years to inform the course of game-play: the wargame map method (AKA the "dungeon"), the channeled plot (nuggets, scenes and standardized plot), to relationship maps and bangs.<br/>
<br/>
What varies between these forms is what the player's participation involves. In the wargame map, it's deciding which way the units (characters) move, and what tactics happen. In the plot methods it's what you do at each juncture along the preset path - Paranioa does this well, because the play is not about choosing the plot, but choosing if/when your character decides to do treasonous things. In the relationship map method, the set framework is the circumstances and how they will react (the characters act much like the map from the first version), and the player gets to determine the plot.<br/>
<br/>
I think that Dogs just represents an alternate way to prepare a relationship map, or something like it (same with MLWM, and a number of other games). But are there other structures that are out there? Could there be?<br/>

<p>There's the <em>InSpectres</em>/<em>UnSpeakable</em> route, which is related to the channeled plot in that there's a basic structure resembling <em>Paranoia</em>, but what happens next is not predetermined. For those two games specifically, the plot is determined by whoever wins a skill roll. The end of the game is determined mechanically (earning all available franchise dice in <em>InSpectres</em>, having one character go permanently insane in <em>UnSpeakable</em>.) Call this one "unchanneled plot".</p>
<p>I'm currently working on two RPGs, using the same resolution mechanics, but different plot control techniques. One is <em>Depths of Kanthe</em>, that Nethack-inspired game that evolved out of my entry for the 24 hour solo rpg challenge; it fits the wargame map method, except the map/dungeon is randomly created through play. The other is a not-quite-named '40 space patrol game that's more like the <em>InSpectres</em> model: generate an initial situation and try to resolve it, but there's no predetermined plot; instead, mechanics guide the creation of plot complications. The plot is finished when there are no more complications and the existing issues are more or less resolved to everyone's satisfaction. I'm expecting this "unchanneled plot" method to have a lot of potential.</p>

                            Ah, good, now I have a name for what Errantry does with its "boons" mechanic. Once you've earned the full number of boon points that you predetermined, you have everything you need to complete your quest. (Since you make up what the boons are as you go along, you may need to be creative to show how they are all used in achieving the quest.)<br><br>Slightly different, I think, is City of Masks, which currently has a set of randomly-assigned goals, a bit like Secret Mission Risk. When someone achieves all their interpersonal and factional goals, the game is over (but that person hasn't necessarily won, since there's a scoring system for various achievements).<br><br>Though come to think of it, the way that plays out is kind of tactics on an R-map.<br><br>Good terminology, folks, good discussion.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
