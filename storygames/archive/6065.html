She's been living there under a year, and my family is taking a week long trip to visit her there.  This is my first time to the Big Apple, and I haven't seen my sister since Christmas, so I'm super excited!<br/><br/>I know there's got to be loads of terrific gamer dorky stuff to see while I'm there.  So what should I look out for?  Any great stores, spots or sights you would recommend?  What greatness does Gotham have to show a visiting gamer?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135486/#Comment_135486" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T22:24:57+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 10:24PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2008 10:27PM by E.T.Smith.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Suprisingly little, I'm afraid. In all of Manhattan, there are but two dedicated gaming stores. The first is the <a href="http://www.thecompleatstrategist.com/" rel="nofollow">Compleat Strategist</a>, which is indeed something of a landmark as its been around since the 70's, when they made their living off of Avalon Hill products. Hidden in their bottom shelves are a lot of books for games that were last published fifteen years past or more, so it can be quite a nostalgia trip, or a chance to fill out gaps in your collection. The second is <a href="http://www.neutralground.com/" rel="nofollow">Neutral Ground</a>, which is a more modern establishment that caters mainly to MtG players and LAN shooters, with big play areas for both. Kind of amusing for the spectacle of middle-aged geeks taking on teenagers in intense card duels.<br/><br/>Otherwise, there's <a href="http://www.fpnyc.com/" rel="nofollow">Forbidden Planet</a>, which began as a specialty science fiction bookstore ages ago, but has developed mostly into a comic shop nowadays, though with a lot of general geek accoutrements still hanging around (there's currently a life-size Dalek guardinng the entrance) and a token gaming section.<br/><br/>You'll tap those out in a couple days. Save most of your time for the <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/" rel="nofollow">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, where you can geek out in the medieval weapons wing and the reconstructed Egyptian tombs. Then hit the <a href="http://www.amnh.org/" rel="nofollow">American Museum of Natural History</a>, where you can ogle the dinosaurs and meteor collection. For god's sake, don't try to get into either of those places on a Saturday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135497/#Comment_135497" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T02:02:06+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  2:02AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to check <a href="http://www.nerdnyc.com/" rel="nofollow"><b>NerdNYC</b></a> before your trip.

We'll be seeing Spamalot, going to the museums and such.  Visiting with my sister who we all miss, and seeing "her" New York.  Eating some great food, definitely.<br><br>As for me, I'm a chill guy, who's main focuses in life are my family and gaming.  I dig Tom Waits, Bowie, Beastie Boys and the Pixies.  For games, I'm pretty into IaWA right now, but in general the whole Indie/Story Games scene really excites me.  I love bold and new foods, with Szechuan being a current fave.   I don't watch a lot of TV, but loved The Wire.<br/><br/>I suppose mostly what I started off looking for here is general gamer spots, as E.T. Smith covers above.  But upon reflection, it seems like it would be really rich to see the "gamer's NYC".  Like, what places or events resonate with you as gamers there.  Maybe that's a tall order, but I'll take what I can get!<br/><br/>Also, my daughter is a huge manga fan/artist.  So any sort of manga/anime/asian culture center would be a big hit there.  I believe we already have <a href="http://www.kidrobot.com/" rel="nofollow">Kid Robot</a> on the to-do list.

We've just had a few discussions here about how one's gamer-life relates to non-gamer life, whether such a division can be said to exist and how reasonable it is to self-identify with gamer subculture. I think a running theme through was that, as in all things, personal preferences trump perceived cultural tags. Meaning what is of gamer interest to me (or anyone else) is almost definitely of little interest to you. For myself, I love the gothic, grand and grim, and could eagerly point out why <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/department.asp?dep=7" rel="nofollow">The Cloisters</a> is a must see, <a href="http://www.stjohndivine.org/" rel="nofollow">The Cathedral of Saint John</a> is worth a trip, and spout endless information on how to go about touring the wonder that is Brooklyn's <a href="http://www.green-wood.com/" rel="nofollow">Green-Wood Cemetery</a>. That's an interest that feeds into my gamer-self and back again, but you (and your family) may not want to spend an afternoon walking among ostentatious crypts. New York is vast beyond most people's expectations, its not possible to fully see even a selective list of sights even if you your visit is several months long. I've been here over seven years now and I'm still making forays into strange little neighborhoods I'd never heard of before. It would be far better to get an idea as to what your general cultural interests are and pursue those first.<br><br>Three bits of advice I can confidently give without reservation. Get the latest edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lets-New-York-City-16th/dp/0312360878/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1205946199&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">Lets Go New York</a> at least a week before your trip and at least skim the major details, it'll keep you from taking your dinners at the local "TGI Fridays" franchise and spare a lot of frustration when the natives tell you things like "take the IRT to Hows-ton" . I specify the Let's Go guide above others, because in my experience its written from the most practical perspective, with an emphasis on the colorful and local rather than big and obvious. As soon as you arrive, find a newsstand and grab the current issue of <a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/" rel="nofollow">Time Out New York</a> and be inundated with the avalanche of cultural events available to you. Finally, the first time you enter the subway, go up to the booth (assuming you can find one with an attendant) and ask for "The Map", which is a free colorful poster-sized detailed map of the entire subway system, indescribably useful and makes a great souvenir. \n<blockquote>Also, my daughter is a huge manga fan/artist.  So any sort of manga/anime/asian culture center would be a big hit there.  I believe we already have<a href="http://www.kidrobot.com/" rel="nofollow">Kid Robot</a>on the to-do list.</blockquote>\nThat's an easier question to parse. Undoubtedly you'll be hitting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Chinatown" rel="nofollow">Chinatown</a>. Check that copy of Time Out to see if they're any walking tours through Chinatown during your stay, they're cheap, great for hearing unusual stories and usually end with dinner in a good authentic restaurant. Less well-known is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreatown%2C_Manhattan" rel="nofollow">Koreatown</a>, which is just one block long, but has the advantage of being within two blocks of Penn Station and the Empire State Building (and also the Compleat Strategist) so its an easy sied trip as you catch the other sights.<br><br>Hope that helps.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB" title="Matthew_SB"><img alt="Matthew_SB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB">Matthew_SB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135564/#Comment_135564" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T11:45:01+00:00" title="March 19, 2008 11:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2008 1:06PM by Matthew_SB.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite><cite>Posted By: Matthew SB</cite><br>I suppose mostly what I started off looking for here is general gamer spots, as E.T.

Little 'g' gamer NYC, as opposed to big 'g' Gamer NYC, if you will.  As such, I very much appriciate your thoughts on the matter, and thank you.  I'm sure our interests diverge on lots of things,  but value the input.  Especially if they help me see the city in ways I might not have otherwise.
