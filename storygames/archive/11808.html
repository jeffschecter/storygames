From everything I've read of Mouse Guard, and what I know of BW, the important stuff isn't in the details of weapons and armor. It's in the BITs, and the impetus to work together.

That's why I'm asking questions and doing research/reading on the rules.  I've not played the rules.  I'm not familiar (yet).  I can't say I already "like" the Mouse Guard's system.  What I do know is I love the Mouse Guard story/comics.  I love the Watership Down story.  They both fall into the area of playing a little animal, where the big world is your adversary.  Watership Down even has it's version of the Mouse Guard within the story (the Owslafa).<br/><br/><br/>Plus the fact that I've heard very good things about Mouse Guard...  all that makes me think it might be a good fit.<br/><br/>My default rule system is using  GURPS Lite (or Ultra-Lite) with the Bunnies &amp; Burrows supplement.  I've considering using Lite or Ultra-Lite because the majority of my group will be folks that have never played an RPG before and their kids.  I then began considering reading/understanding Mouse Guard - to teach that for running the game, since I will NEED to teach a set of rules regardless.  The difference.  I've GMed and Played GURPS before, so I know the basics.  Mouse Guard - I know very little about.<br/><br/><br/>Any specific advice on the reasons for using Mouse Guard, and the important  "BITS"  to consider   or   not is helpful.<br/>thanks<br/>-kev-                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263948/#Comment_263948" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T15:18:47+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  3:18PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, use GURPS Bunnies and Burrows.  <br/>It's not completely terrible...but terrible for emulating literature written with children. <br/>It doesn't have the focus or rewards like TSOY does.<br/>You as Gm, and the players will have to bring that focus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263951/#Comment_263951" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T15:41:36+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  3:41PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H.</cite>So, use GURPS Bunnies and Burrows.<br/>It's not completely terrible...but terrible for emulating literature written with children.</blockquote>\n<br/><br/>You're misunderstanding....  I am  INTERESTED  in trying/learning/playing  the Mouse Guard RPG  (and using the rules).   I have a group of people that are  NOT  gamers.  I will be "teaching"  them to play regardless of the rule set.  I am trying to ask advice and suggestions about Mouse Guard to see if folks that  HAVE  played it would think that it is viable, cool, fun and  (possibly)  advantageous  to use Mouse Guard rules for a Watership Down story (with rabbits in place of the Mice). <br/>Is it  WORTH  it to make a hack for Bunnies &amp; Burrows (Watership Down) for Mouse Guard,  or would the rules  NOT work or break down at any point so that it would not be worth the enjoyment or effort.<br/><br/>I'm just looking for opinions from folks that have played and enjoyed  (or found problems with)  the Mouse Guard rules/game.  And if those folks think it might work well for a  NEW  group of non-gamers for a Watership Down story.  Could the rules for Mouse Guard  LEND  to the fun/energy of a Watership Down style story  since  the PRIMARY interest in trying a role-playing game  (at all)  is to play a Watership Down style story.   <br/><br/><br/>I can make the choice if I want, at any time, to go with  GURPS.... but I am interested  (as a GM &amp; gamer)  to try the Mouse Guard game.  HOWEVER,  if folks that have played MG give suggestions that lead me to believe that using MG rules would  in any way  take AWAY from the fun of the story  (for new non-game players)  I would rather  NOT  convert.<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263958/#Comment_263958" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T16:28:56+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  4:28PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if anything in particular will break if you use MG to run nonanthropomorphic bunnies. You won't have weapons or gear, but those are all just modifiers for scripted conflicts so that's no big deal. <br/><br/>Probably the biggest hurdle will be hacking Nature, although I'll bet the stock Mouse nature is probably close in characteristic to a theoretical Rabbit nature.<br/><br/>Hm...structurally you'll need to make sure that individual characters have needs outside the mission they've been handed. Which reminds me: MG is built on an assumption that there is a tension between missions you're handed (addressed during the GM's Turn) and personal stuff you want to accomplish (addressed during the Players' Turn). There's a whole duty-versus-self thing kind of running through the game. Do you think that's accurate to Watership Down?

Rabbits just want to hang out, silflay some carrots,  make kittens, tell stories. They need scouts and lookouts, and males do establish a hierarchy, so you've got your Owsla. <br/><br/>But striking out, journeying across hill and dale, crossing streams, assessing traps, is bewildering to bunnies. They're not great at it, or at working together. Bigwig is aggressive and takes his sweet time coming to accept Hazel's leadership. Fiver is seer-crazy and may scream and run away. Dandelion (maybe? the clever one) may get excited about his discovery and not be able to explain it. Hazel has leadership skills and is always working to keep the rabbits motivated and on target.<br/><br/>So I'm thinking a game specific to the WD portrayal of rabbits needs to contrast Goals with general Bunny Nature (fear response, not too bright) and, for the PC-ish tier of bunnies whose names I'm remembering, pop those against a Noteworthy Trait that is useful in some circumstances but not others. This sounds like story (and storyteller) structure, but suggests mechanics as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263975/#Comment_263975" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T22:36:04+00:00" title="March 24, 2010 10:36PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think hacking Mouse Guard before you've run or played Mouse Guard as-is... well, that's not what I would do.<br/><br/>Get some experience with the game under your belt before you start ripping it apart and putting it back together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263978/#Comment_263978" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T23:18:50+00:00" title="March 24, 2010 11:18PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can't just come out and say what we're all thinking, now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263979/#Comment_263979" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T23:37:20+00:00" title="March 24, 2010 11:37PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jaywalt</cite>I think hacking Mouse Guard before you've run or played Mouse Guard as-is... well, that's not what I would do.<br/><br/>Get some experience with the game under your belt before you start ripping it apart and putting it back together.</blockquote>\n<br/><a href="/forums/profile/jaywalt">@jaywalt</a>  &amp;  noclue,<br/>No thank you.<br/><br/>Because.....  I don't HAVE anyone interested in playing the mice of Mouse Guard.  I DO however have folks interested in playing rabbits in a Watership Down game.  I HAVE been interested in playing Mouse Guard (the setting  AND  the rules).  So if I can't play the setting due to lack of players, and I CAN play the rules with a very limited  "hack"  of the rules -  WHY is that a poor choice?<br/><br/>I'm not "ripping" anything apart.  I'm simply asking for ideas to understand if the MG rules would  "need"  alot of changes.  I don't get the impression that it WOULD.  <br/>I have also GMed "hacked" versions of several other RPGs before running the original and found them to come out astonishingly well.  My "hack" of My Life With Master  (to My Life With The Batman)  was the first and only game that ended with a full standing ovation for the fun of the game.  So... I'm confident in running the rules with another setting - as long as I've done my research up front (ie. including my questions HERE) the end result can be great if I find Mouse Guard can fit Watership Down well...<br/><br/><br/><br/>That said.  Back to the topic.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/YunusWesley">@YunusWesley</a>  -  I am very interested in where you're headed.  I like your thoughts and I would love to hear more on your points.

I suppose my point is to "rule-out" my option for using Mouse Guard rules to run/play a Watership Down based game for a group of (mostly) 1st time players - who are more interested in the story of play than the rules anyway...  My default rule-set is to use GURPS-Lite with the Bunnies &amp; Burrows supplement,  and I'm comfy with that.  However, as noted previously, I am excited with everything I hear about MG (rules and setting - I have read the comics)  that I would enjoy using it if it doesn't "break" or "bend" any MG rules too harshly.  <br/><br/>Here are my questions to your points  (anyone's welcome to help give answer)...  These are NOT to challenge you, just honestly asking to understand better as I read the rules you mention from the MG rule-book.<br/><br/>-  the Nature ability:  why would it be irrelevant with Watership Down rabbits?  How/Why does it impact the Mouse Guard setting for use of rules more than it would/should for Watership Down?<br/><br/>-  Scale:  on the MG scale chart rabbits are on the tier JUST above Mouse Guard mice.  How/Why is that an issue?  <br/><br/>-  Weather:  I have no context here, why do you note weather along with Scale?  Why wouldn't weather work in a Watership Down setting?<br/><br/>-  Voiding Warranty:  I'm generally/genuinely confused at your point.  <br/><br/>-  Play Balance:  I am asking/looking specifically  FOR  any play balance issues that might arise from the change in setting themes/style, scale of rabbits/mice, rule-play of Mouse Guard overall, and omissions (of: anthropomorphic use of tools, weapons, armor, professions, etc... )<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Kevin,<br/>Have you asked around on the Burning Wheel forums?

The comment about dramatic tension in MG coming out of conflict between personal and larger goals made me immediately think of the kinds of tensions and conflicts in Watership Down. They are tensions that could certainly be handled non-mechanically by a GM and players interested in telling those kind of stories; and indeed I can't tell from the above comments if those conflicts of interest are mechanically reflected in MG at all. Can someone fill us in?<br/><br/>But where I was going was a sketch of how it could work mechanically. An extraordinary rabbit like General Woundwort has some personal quality, a drive to protect rabbits from discovery by humans, that allows him to force his will on many, many rabbits, overcoming their natural tendencies: the rabbits of his warren pass droppings underground, put up with overcrowding, and are tightly controlled by the Owsla. So the General has, say, a FATE Aspect that he invokes again and again, or a large dice pool with the biggest dice in the game, that he uses to overcome the rabbits' Nature.<br/><br/>That special quality should have some kind of synergistic effect with Goals or Motivation. Fiver's vision of the first warren's destruction convinces Hazel and a few others, but along the journey, it's Hazel's Goal to find a safe new warren that keeps the various rabbits in line; his Goal aspect or pool interacts with his leadership quality. <br/><br/>Or maybe there only has to be two traits, the Talent and Nature, either one of them being used to solve problems as the situation demands, but Nature also resisting un-rabbit-like actions such as controlled breeding!<br/><br/>Thoughts? I'm more of a house-ruler than any kind of designer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
