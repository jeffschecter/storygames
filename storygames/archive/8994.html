Other than the fact that there is a community of people centered around the yearly game convention Fastaval that identify itself as belonging to that tradition. Each year, 15-25 scenarios are developed and presented at the game convention. Designed to be played only by reading the text, usually read in advance by a game master. The classical format is 5 or 6 players, one game master and 4-6 hours.<br/><br/>Other game conventions exist (e.g. Viking-Con), and scenarios are written also for these, but one thing makes Fastaval stand out: The Otto competition. Initiated in the early nineties as a pastiche over the Oscar awards, it rewards the submitted entries in different categories. The categories currently are: Best Scenario, Best Story, Best Mechanics, Best Characters, Best Presentation, The Audience Award, and the Jury Special Price. The Otto committee is composed by 4-6 volunteers from the community, usually previous contributors.<br/> <br/>Due to the competition and due to the tradition to have people volunteer to run a game from the written text alone, there is much focus on presentation and communication of how to run the game. <br/><br/>The Danish roleplaying game conventions began in the early eighties. The first Fastaval was in 1986 and the first Viking Con was in 1982.<br/><br/><b>Phase 1: The age of systems</b><br/>Up until around 1990, events at the game convention would be called e.g. the AD&amp;D scenario and the Call scenario, being written for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons and Call of Cthulhu. Player characters would be defined by filling in the player characters sheets for these games and the scenario would be a mystery in the classic investigation &amp; action genre.<br/><br/><b>Phase 2: Everything went basic - the coming of characters</b><br/>At some point, player characters would get a back story and some predetermined relations with the other player characters. The stats for the characters would fade in the background, being stated more for flavor than for function. Scenarios would state at first that the system was \u201cbasic roleplaying\u201d (1992), then  they would claim to be \u201csystemless\u201d (1993).<br/><br/>Conflicts were roleplayed (i.e. player vs. player discussion) or determined by GM fiat.<br/><br/><b>Phase 3: Intrigues everywhere</b><br/>Different genres would then evolve. A very popular one were intrigue games, where some or all of the session is played out with the players moving around in character and talking with each other and secretly with one or more game masters. The first of these appeared around 1994.<br/><br/>Semi-live would show up as an important technique, where scenes are set usually by the game master and acted out in characters by the players, but without costumes, and with a clear defined scene start and scene end. Sometimes symbolic props will be used (swords, guns, etc.). <br/><br/>Storytelling roleplaying (fort\xe6llerollespil) was another genre to appear (around 1997). Sometimes without a game master, games of this kind would present detailed characters with a predefined background and provide with a framing story in which the characters would tell stories about the past.<br/><br/>Extras roleplaying (bipersonrollespil) arrived around 2002. The scenario would focus on a tight story where all or all but one of the players would play extras. This works well for comedy with a very strict setup of scenes, and for drama focused on one central character.<br/><br/>The last genre to be mentioned here is the ensemble drama, where each player has multiple characters, playing out a story in the style of Magnolia or Short Cuts. <br/><br/><b>Phase 4: The rebirth of systems</b><br/>Around 2003, the indie wave started being noticed in Denmark, gaining followers among e.g. people, who liked that they were allowed to roll dice and play a game again, rather than striving for character immersion and a strong game master to control the story. Up until that point, it was a strong opinion that rules and mechanics got in the way of pure play. You\u2019d never talk about the game during the game \u2013 if you had to break out of character, you would break the illusion and ruin the game.<br/><br/>The Forge put focus on the narrative and the drama rather than simulation and physics. But also allowed this to be explicit in the game rather than something that the game master secretly did behind the curtain.<br/><br/>Scenarios were submitted that suddenly used cards and dice for distributing authority over the story differently between the participants.<br/><br/>Also, the j\xe4vla avant-garde Swedes would show up and present Jeepform as yet another style of play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

In a Kafkaic universe, a group of characters struggle to obey the system while keeping their personal integrity.<br/><br/><i>Jisei, Kristoffer Apollo, 1997</i><br/>The first storytelling scenario. Four characters are meditating in a tee house before the samurai among them is going to perform seppuku. They retell the past, prompted by a game master, while looking into each other\u2019s eyes.<br/><br/><i>Arken [The Ark], Alex Uth, 1997</i><br/>Broke many of the unwritten rules of the time. Starting out with the six characters as gods in a fantasy world, they travel to another world to fight off the threat to their world only to find themselves trapped in the mind and body of a schizophrenic in a mental institution.<br/><br/><i>V\xe5genat [The Wake], Jacob Schmidt-Madsen, 1998</i><br/>A story telling game, claiming the death of roleplaying. Each of the four players take on narrative powers representing the gaming styles of that time. Together they tell the story of the woman who is lying dead before them. Without game master, the session is driven by envelopes within envelopes that each reveal the rules for the next part of the game.<br/><br/><i>Bondem\xe6nd og Biavlere [Farmers and Beekeepers], Frederik Berg \xd8stergaard, 2002</i><br/>The first scenario in the extras tradition. A comedy that retells the days of the seventies when hippies moved to the country side and met the rural Denmark.<br/><br/><i>A Day in the Life, Mikkel B\xe6kgaard, 2005</i><br/>An ensemble story, where each of the four players portray three characters whose stories interweave throughout a single day in London, from early morning to late night. A game master sets the scenes and control the flow of the story. Drama and emotion are ensured by the tight setup of the predefined characters \u2013 however in each session, different conflicts turn out as the main focus.<br/><br/><i>Det halve kongerige [The Half Kingdom], Tobias Demiduk Bindslet, 2005</i><br/>A prince is preparing himself to become the new king as his father lies on his deathbed. He travels the country in the company of the Queen, the Jester, the Wizard and the King, learning about the past and the country and ultimately defines the truth by retelling what has happened as he steps up to become king. The prince asks questions about the past to the other four who replies in turn by setting a scene that reveals the answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198752/#Comment_198752" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T14:07:00+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  2:07PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for doing this, Frederik.

I know for certain that many of the more influential art-haus larp-wrights started with WOD-larps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198840/#Comment_198840" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T04:52:26+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  4:52AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2009 4:52AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://jeepen.org/games/ladyotto/lady_and_otto.pdf" rel="nofollow">Lady and Otto</a> | <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/" rel="nofollow">Jeep in English</a> | <a href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244/index.html" rel="nofollow">Montsegur 1244</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Taking the Hollywood model for action movies and applying it to scenarios were actually an important step in having a more reflected approach to scenario design. You had to have a hook, escalation and turning points, a point of no return, leading to the climax followed by a denoument. This was introduced around 1993-4 and used in workshops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198966/#Comment_198966" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T16:27:05+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  4:27PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "Fastawood" model was introduced by Troels Chr Jacobsen at a scenario workshop in 1992, as far as I remember.

It's a funny coincidence, I've been thinking about writing an article about the Danish styles and their development for the past couple of weeks. I'll get back to it after Fastaval - I think there are a few more styles (or substyles) worth mentioning, and I'll try to add something about the whys and hows to the whats (for the uninitiated: Fastaval is just over a week away as of this writing).<br/>\n<br/>\n@Jason: I would say that the major trend at this year's Fastaval is fusion. Merging the styles and techniques of the Danish tradition with outside influences such as stricter rules-based mechanics or jeepform techniques. In fact, I think this has been the defining trend for a couple of years now - Danish scenario writers have looked at the indie wave with interest but not forgotten their own tradition, and so they have a whole bunch of tools available, and the challenge lies in picking the right tools for your idea and mixing them in the right way. I think the Fastaval scenarios will show that the results are getting better and better (I'm president of the Otto jury this year, so I've read the lot).<br/>\n<br/>\n@Jonathan: The convention scenarios are certainly played outside conventions. I know several groups with a long-running tradition of playing the best convention scenarios at home. The two sites Frederik referred to, R'lyeh and Alexandria, have a huge stake in this since they've made a whole lot of scenarios available for free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
