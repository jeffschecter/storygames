I'm used to making board and card games and about the biggest difference I have noticed between them and RPGs is the idea of the players \u201ccontract\u201d, basically that everyone at the table is working to make the game function properly. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere an exploitable mechanic in a board game means the game is broken, in an RPG it just means anyone who's exploiting the mechanic is kind of being a jerk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for my latest project I wanted to take the idea of the contract or agreement and make it tangible, an actual contract that people sign before they play the game. But I'm having a little trouble figuring out what the contract should actually say and what kind of behaviors I want to encourage. I suppose I will have a much better idea about what to say once I actually start play testing the game but I would like to have some kind of contract to start play testing with.<br/>\n<br/>\nhere is what i currently have for the contract<br/>\n<br/>\nOn this the __ day of __ in the __ year of our common era we the undersigned agree to be awesome people. We will do our best to live in the spirit of the moment, to say yes to the narration of others, to challenge each other and yet not be a dicks about it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat should i add or take away from that? Are there any behaviors that you find particularly irksome?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
