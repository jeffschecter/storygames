I read posts on RPG.net about BW being an "anti-GM" game, about "hippie" story games that sacrifice fun for design, and poo-pooing GM-less games like Polaris because they have "no structure" (which is pretty funny if you think about it).  I talk to many "normal" RPG players who either won't try story games or they have toyed with it and have found the experience either unsettling or found that it didn't work well with their group.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, I've been at the table fighting my own historical tendencies to railroad games and watching players either fall flat or not be happy when asked to share the burden of creative decision-making.  So there's obviously something there.<br/><br/>Which makes me wonder why organizing and running a game is seen as some sort of mystical art?  And not just games either.  I was doing research into storytelling techniques and kept encountering books telling the reader to "make sure they were the ones telling the story" and to actively keep others from interfering with "the story".  In the books I read there was no thought of collaborative storytelling and it made me a little sad.<br/><br/>So I ask: why do you think collaboration is threatening to so many people?  GMs fear their loss of control and the investment they have made in their worlds.  Players rue the ability to just show up at a game and be entertained for several hours.  But it does appear that many gamers want something different and they can often run into trouble with it.<br/><br/>Is this a group dynamics issue?  Or a player buy-in issue?  Or something else?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72500/#Comment_72500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T16:27:27+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  4:27PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>So I ask: why do you think collaboration is threatening to so many people?

Long term rp gamers ( although I've met wargamers who are just as averse to similar/parallel mechanicsand styles in wargames).<br/><br/>Here's the thing: I honestly do not believe that other people are threatened by collaboration. Almost all other types of games have the participants in relatively equal footing, the main exceptions being referees in sports or maybe the banker in Monopoly, and both of those cases are ones where that person is essentially a facillitator of some sort.<br/><br/>Us roleplayers?

Seriously, I see this all the time.  A whole bunch of people say, "Hey, wouldn't X be cool?  Let's go about doing X!" and they all sort of do stuff towards making X happen, but in the end it just sort of flounders and dies.  And then everybody just gripes about how X <em>would have</em> been cool, if it had happened.  They had no structure on which to make the collaboration work.<br/><br/>Hands down, the easiest structure for a group is a dictator.  Introduce a dictator into that mess of people wanting to do something cool, and all of the sudden <em>like magic</em> things start happening.  The dictator doesn't even have to be that talented for this to work.  He just needs to say stuff like, "We meet on Saturday at 6pm" and magically, people show up at 6 (some people can't make 6, but consequently, they aren't there and the people who are there have fun).  Especially in our everybody's-equal society, though, people are very hesitant to take on the role of dictator.  They don't want to tell people what to do.  Alternately, they are afraid that they will screw up and people will mourn the missed opportunity (X would have been cool if it happened, but it didn't and it's Joe's fault).  So there are relatively few people who are willing to even <em>try</em> being the dictator.  Then those few pick up a few extra tricks and techniques, and compared to the folks who are scared of taking up the position, these people acheive mythic status.<br/><br/>Then there accretes this sort of social feedback thing, where players show up to game and it's the GM who (a) juggles and directs the attention of the group so that the players feel they are included and (b) metes out approval for their creative contributions.  So the GM becomes a source of attention and approval.  That is potent, potent shit, especially when it works around to feedback status.  The GM makes us feel good, so we empower the GM some more to make us feel good again.  Over the extreme long term, some players who are not well-served by a particular GM fall out of the group -- they find something better to do -- and those who are well-served by the GM stick around.  The GM and the games that the GM run become tailored to the group of players.  You get these very tight groups that "play well together" and who treasure the feedback loop of attention and approval that they've built up over the years.<br/><br/>Games which propose a different structure for creative collaboration, then, can sound like they are attacking the cult of the mythical and magical dictator-GM, which might be the only way players have ever seen collaboration work.  They can sound, in fact, like a direct threat to the hobby as they understand it (not to mention a direct threat to the authority and benefits that the GMs are now accustomed to getting).  So they have a kneejerk reaction, and don't try the alternative structure at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72512/#Comment_72512" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T16:53:16+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  4:53PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, JBR.

Fact is, even some groups that <i>do</i> try an alternative structure find that it doesn't work, and you can't lay the blame for that at the feet of some kind of reactionary, soul-blighting, shameful flaw in the people involved.  And that's if there's even any blame at all in every situation like that, which I think isn't true.<br/><br/>It's closer to what he said in the paragraph before: sometimes you get a group dynamic that has been well-established and has all the kinks worked out, and everyone's having a great time with it.  Once you're at that point -- which, let's be honest, is a point that you should <i>want</i> to be at -- you're golden.  You've got something wonderful that you should treasure.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say that you shouldn't try out new stuff, but by the same token you are not <i>obligated</i> to try new stuff.  You're not a bad person if you don't: hell, there are lots of reasons why a group that's got a good thing going should just stick with it and not branch out (take, for example, those groups that can only play infrequently and would like to get the best possible experience out of the fewest number of sessions).  And if you do try something new and say "whoa, this doesn't work as well as what we were doing before," it's not because you're some kind of jerk who hates new things: the new game just didn't measure up to your old one.  There's nothing at all wrong about trying things and deciding which one you like best.  It's chocolate versus vanilla versus strawberry, that's all, and while it's awesome to have a favorite flavor, it doesn't make you better or worse than other people who have other favorites or even people who think all three are pretty good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72523/#Comment_72523" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T17:24:17+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  5:24PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2007 5:24PM by johnzo.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JDCorley:  I would love to see a post from you on How You Can Use Your Management Bookshelf to Enhance Your GMing Power.<br/><br/>AFT: word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72528/#Comment_72528" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T17:47:01+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  5:47PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hyperbole: it's a <em>Dogs</em> trait counted in d4s.<br/><br/>AFT, it's a cult if they don't try anything else out of blind faith that their way is the only way anything works.

And <i>because </i>of that, the GM-dictator model is a lot more comfortable in a lot of levels. Creating a story <i>is </i>a mystical art. I think that a lot of players, old and new, find the idea of sharing the burden of the story a lot more engaging in a personal, emotional way, than just giving input by directing the present actions of their characters. GMs tend to have this level of involvement with their "worlds" and "stories", for instance.<br/><br/>A lot of the success of story games (and a lot of it's lack of success) comes from the fact that they are more "intense" than their cousins, because, when you collaborate with a story, you're  investing a part of yourself in it, and you're accepting a certain amount of vulnerability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72589/#Comment_72589" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T02:06:50+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  2:06AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have to remember that many people don't always want the extra effort of collaboration.

I think either Ron Edwards of Chris Chinn wrote about the game group that has spent years patching together a dynamic that is something close to functional by splicing together house rules and various social constructs, and are now incredibly hesitant to mess with their spit-and-bailing-wire contraption because they assume the long and laborious process they went through is <i>absolutely normal</i> and will have to be mounted again.<br/><br/>(Pessimism alert.)<br/><br/>The other possibility is simply that the traditional GM role is a huge power trip, especially for us nerdy types who may not have a lot of control or standing in their day-to-day life. Ergo, embracing games that turn that role on its ear is incredibly threatening.

Workplace. Family. (in their "traditional" forms). RPGs recapitulate the structure of everyday life. For many people, the strictures of authoritarian or hierarchal (not necessarily the same) interaction are important. When those strictures are removed, their absence leads to profound anxiety and emotional discomfort. They don't know what to do, and are paralyzed with social anxiety over how others will react to them. It's the flipside of what JD said above. The GM is thinking "what if my players' ideas suck?". The player is thinking: "My ideas are gonna suck, and everybody is going to laugh at me."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72625/#Comment_72625" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T08:14:35+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  8:14AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            School, workplace, and family aren't passtimes.<br/><br/>I do think that parallel is insightful, however.

What puzzles me is that I've had players take me aside and bitch about how their input is constantly ignored by the GM. But then, when I have them try a game that actively gives them input the GM cannot, by the rules, ignore, they come back and tell me that it's totally stupid and they don't want to play it again. They then cling to the other game that blatantly allows the GM to ignore them most of the session.<br/><br/>I could offer similar examples with other aspects of play. It boggles me.<br/><br/>So, yeah, it's less proving that someone else isn't having fun, and more wondering why they're so happy to have the production of that fun be a total crap-shoot, or totally in the hands of someone other than themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72627/#Comment_72627" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T08:23:20+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  8:23AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pastimes aren't "pastimes".

[...]Or something else?</blockquote>Geez, Chris, look at the loaded term above. Perhaps some people are "afraid" of doing things a different way, but you ought to consider that maybe what they're doing is if not perfect for them, a lot better at what they want to achieve than what many "story games" can accomplish. Telling other people they don't know what they want is bound to cause backlash.<br/><br/>It's not that the paradigm shift from D&amp;D to (say) <i>Polaris</i> isn't a big one. It is, and there may be people who find the difference daunting. But the gap isn't just one of skill or creativity, but also of taste. It seems a lot of the folks hereabouts have been trying to do things with RPGs that most RPGs weren't designed for, so they're delighted when they discover story games. But  listen to the most basic responses of people reacting to story games, stuff like "If I wanted to tell a story...", "If I wanted to play a boardgame...". In many cases they understand there's a profound paradigm shift: they're just not terribly interested in what's on the other side of the gap. A very broad analogy would be to question someone on why they don't like to watch sports on TV by explaining the rules of basketball. Dude, I know how to play basketball, I just think it's boring to watch.<br/><br/>About the GM, I agree with komeradebob: RPGs are unusual. But why the GM? Of course the GM functions as a referee and coordinator. But as I've said numerous times, one of the key qualities a GM provides is the GM/player divide, which for many people represents the character/world divide. And it's this rough mapping which enables people to "get into their characters". I reckon it's about the same thing that Ian Millington calls <a href="http://www.collaborativeroleplay.org.uk/AvatarismAndTheMythOfTheRedQueen" rel="nofollow">"avatarism"</a>.  Now, Millington has decided that avatarism isn't very important to him, and he goes on to endorse methods of roleplaying that work against it. But he recognizes the thing exists, and that it can be a primary attraction of RPGs for some people.<br/><br/>However, all too often, I see people arguing that the tastes of others are based on phony criteria that are "really" proxies for conservatism in method.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72630/#Comment_72630" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T08:25:07+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  8:25AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2007 8:26AM by Thor_O.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think organizing and running games is seen as a mystical art because in many ways it was. For years in this hobby, good GMs had a number of techniques at their disposal for all sorts of things, from creating scenes to generating situation, making players care about their NPCs, etc. They may have picked them up from reading widely, from keen observation, through mentoring by another good GM, or simply by instinct. I'm not saying all the techniques were the same or even similar. But they worked.<br/><br/>For a long time, that stuff was a GM's "art." It wasn't really recorded anywhere in the games. Either you learned how to do the stuff that entertained your group and were a good GM, or you didn't and weren't.<br/><br/>Part of the trend for the past few years has been for some designers to take some of their techniques and encode them in their games to make them more accessible. You wind up getting stuff like Kickers, Bangs, Relationship Maps, Say Yes or Roll Dice, Let It Ride, and many others. They're all techniques that can be used to make some games better.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's the cause, but I could imagine that some of the resistance might be akin to the way stage magicians feel when the tricks of their trade are revealed. GMs, especially, don't like the idea that their art can be reduced to some rules and guidelines.<br/><br/>But more generally, I suspect the resistance comes from a few things:<br/>1. People in this hobby identify very strongly with the games that they play. Raising the possibility that their game is lacking something can immediately put some people on the defensive.<br/><br/>2. Related to the first, for some reason, the first reaction people have to any suggestion that their gaming could be better is that you are calling their gaming inadequate.<br/><br/>3. I think that for some people, when you suggest a particular new game might have tools that will help them create story (or similar claims), it is perceived as implying that the person is incapable of doing it without help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72631/#Comment_72631" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T08:25:52+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  8:25AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark W:<br/>Well good lord, man- then hit me with your best social psych perspective!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72632/#Comment_72632" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T08:25:56+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  8:25AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I prefer <em>tyrant</em> to dictator.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72635/#Comment_72635" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T08:39:29+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  8:39AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>If what you're saying is right, then Gamers are associating the structure of the rpging passtime with much more serious parts of life than is usual for passtimes.</blockquote>\nMy wife, a non-gamer who has played RPGs a couple times, was once reading over my shoulder as I perused an issue of <i>Dungeon</i>.

The opinion between these casual gamers and the veteran gamer are the same: there's a GM because that's the way it works. No contest, no wondering "Could we do this differently?" These are real people that have not one iota of issue with the GM being in charge - my veteran player even told me, when we were discussing games like TSoY, "You're the GM, man. It's your game. I come to your games because they're your games. Not my game, not our game, your game. I don't want to have a hand in how things are resolved beyond deciding what to do, I don't want to be able to change the setting to suit my character or any of that. You let us run our characters, we let you run everything else, and we have a fucking blast."<br/><br/>What this comes down to is that GMs aren't mystical; they're not experts; like Joshua and a couple others have indicated it's a matter of who takes the reins and who is willing to put in the effort. It's genetic - some people like to build things, others like to use what others have built. There's nothing wrong with it, there's nothing destructive or unfair or corrosive about it <strong>unless people in a play group start having problems with that structure</strong>. When a GM says, "You know, I thought I was playing this heroic fantasy game of things the characters do but instead it seems like it's a parody of things the characters try to do and fail." At that point, something does need to be done and if it's adopting a more collaborative structure than that's it.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd prefer that my players be a little more collaborative. It makes my job easier as a GM and I think it makes the game more entertaining. I'm slowly working on them - my next step is to introduce Tribe 8 via FATE 3.0. Hopefully when they get a taste of it they'll like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72643/#Comment_72643" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T08:55:50+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  8:55AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><br/>My wife, for some reason, took the magazine and read through the article.

The fact that Gamers, the ones who've tried rpgs and continue to play them, are largely comfortable with that traditional set up makes us an abberation compared to the vast bulk of people engaging in passtimes. Can anyone think of any other passtime that has anything closely similar to the traditional relation of GM and players in rpgs?<br/><br/>( Clergy+ congregation comes to mind, although I wouldn't count that as a passtime...)</blockquote>\n<br/>Well, there's local theater and amateur film-making -- both of which generally will have a director whose role is more dictatorial than a game-master.  i.e. A director can tell actors where they should move or how to say their lines, whereas that would be over-the-top in a GM.  <br/><br/>Most clubs of any sort will have a president along with other officers.  All of the singing groups that I was in would have a director as well.  In the smaller ones like quartets many things would work by consensus, but there was still a leader who would take responsibility for organizational things.  Overall, I'm hard-pressed to think of leaderless collaborations in the style of something like Polaris where no one is differentiated.

There's also the simple fact that it is a fairly effective structure for getting certain kinds of rewards out of play, that it can be less demanding/stressful for players, and that it provides egoboo for the GM.<br/><br/>You also see a certain level of ideological commitment to this kind of structure. If you hold the belief that authoritarian and/or heirarchal structures are necessary/right <i>in general</i>, you're not likely to challenge that belief with your gaming. This needn't be on some kind of internet-caricature level of tyranny, either. Plenty of generally reasonable people have felt that human beings need structure, law, and leadership in order to produce anything of value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72679/#Comment_72679" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T10:34:38+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 10:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>But it's great to get some different perspectives here.

On average, players are generally choosing not between D&amp;D and Polaris, say, but between D&amp;D and other popular activities like video games, board games, or going to the movies.  <br/><br/>However, I think it's fair to say that most players of tabletop RPGs are looking for something that is more participatory than static fiction (i.e. books/movies/etc.) or non-RPG video games -- but that still has a well-defined place where the buck stops as far as decisions go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72682/#Comment_72682" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T11:00:06+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 11:00AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2007 11:00AM by Arminius.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>Am I correct in observing that many of you feel the GM is in a privileged position because the players prefer it that way?

I've gotta admit that an enthusiastic, energetic GM is a great thing to have. You don't have to learn the rules. You don't have to motivate yourself. The GM can just line up the targets for you to shoot down, it's great. ('Course they need to be the kinds of targets you enjoy shooting at. I think the Flags concept that I first saw in "Forgie" discourse is a great way of accomplishing this without demanding too much work from the players.) And also, yes, the GM is a good method of maintaining a single vision as JD says above.<br/><br/>But largely: no. There are roleplayers who enjoy boardgames and sports, yet they prefer the GM/player split. Why? Because the GM/player split gives them something that's not in those other activities. I'm getting kind of frustrated at having to say this again and again: if you look at the history of RPGs, the GM wasn't introduced into gaming to be a storyteller, but to provide the sense of an external world that the players can operate "within". While boardgames can also do this in some ways, the GM combines that function with the ability of a human being to respond flexibly to any type of input provided or level of detail demanded by players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72683/#Comment_72683" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T11:02:22+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 11:02AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Buzz --<br/>Have you considered the social ramifications?<br/><br/>"I want to contribute to the fiction" is very different from "I want to have my fictional contributions ratified by the group leader, maybe so I can show that I'm cooler than everyone else."<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72689/#Comment_72689" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T11:26:20+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 11:26AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Have you considered the social ramifications?<br/><br/>"I want to contribute to the fiction" is very different from "I want to have my fictional contributions ratified by the group leader, maybe so I can show that I'm cooler than everyone else."</blockquote>\nWell, I have now. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And yes, I can totally see this applying to the person I used in my example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72690/#Comment_72690" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T11:26:56+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 11:26AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>Am I correct in observing that many of you feel the GM is in a privileged position because the players prefer it that way?

Also, what Ben said, which is a pattern that I tend to see in a lot of "other organized activities" as well.

However, I think there's generally an expectation that the person has to earn their keep. If said quarterback keeps calling lousy plays and can't hit the broad side of a barn, he's not quarterback for long. <br/><br/>Is the same thing true for RPGs, though?

I think it does come down to taste, sure. No matter how that taste comes about. If a person is brain damaged (I am, for one), then why should somebody take away what's fun for him? There might be an imperative to stop others from being brain-damaged, but not from those already brain-damaged from enjoying what their new brain will allow.<br/>\n<br/>\nCult? We're all part of cults. Same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's why we (the story-gaming elite - see, I'm brain-damaged in two ways), push the story-gaming mode. Because gaming isn't fun for us otherwise. Yeah, sounds obvious, but consider the ramifications. It's not enough for us to be playing alone in a game where we're empowered to create. It's not fun for us if others aren't creating, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually attibute this to my laziness as a GM. I always found that the amount of work I had to do previously to make a game go, as I was the only one being creative, was staggering. I kinda enjoyed it, but could only do so much of it. Just would get tired out after a while. By using methods where everything neccessary is created in play, with the help of the other players, it's all so much easier now. I don't prep for play hardly at all any more. Certainly no more than creativity grabs me and makes me do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we wonder is... if they tried, wouldn't they like it? Now, annecdotes here say that they won't. They've considered it, at least as much as they're ever going to do so, and they don't want it. What makes us go, "Uh, but, wait..." is that when you present a game like TSOY to somebody who's never played it, they tend to be like, "This is cool. Not really so different from what I expected."<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean it's fascinating that the example above uses TSOY... since it really doesn't give players much if any directorial authority at all. It basically allows players to create plot through the decisions of what keys to buy, and how to have the character react to them. So any objection that TSOY is about giving the player more authority than just what he'd normally have over the character... well, when Clinton made the game, he said he didn't want to give that sort of authority. It's pretty traditional.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... the reaction just sounds kneejerk.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut it another way. I can still play D&amp;D; and have fun with it as D&amp;D.; Not expecting it to do something else than I know it's capable of doing. I mean, to us it often sounds like, "I won't play Chess! Checkers works just fine!" Well, sure. It's not an attack on that style of play to suggest something else. Or shouldn't be. So, if an offer to play some other game is made honestly... why should somebody be so vehement in their rejection?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds... sounds, mind you... like the person is being defensive. Which is no reason to avoid trying something new.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, maybe it's just frustration... maybe they've been asked too many times. Or the asker has implied that the other mode is superior. Or they're afraid of losing out on the investment of the campaign running (you're not suggesting dropping it for TSOY, are you?). Maybe, as suggested, there's only room for one game, and the player wants to finish this one. All valid reasons to reject playing something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we story-gamers are just a really paranoid bunch just trying to push our own agenda in political fashion across the RPG landscape.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr... maybe there are some folks out there who might enjoy a change of pace if they tried it.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably some of both.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe suggestion I have for we story-gamers is just to be all Tao about it. Show, don't tell. Play. Post actual play. Ask people to play what you're playing, not as a replacement or something superior, but just as what you love to do, and want to have other people participate in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause if people out there really are being defensive, there's no way you're going to convince them to play what you want to play. It's a losing battle. If they're honestly making a decision about what they want to play, then you won't convince them that way either.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to let people convince themselves. And don't worry about those who aren't convinced.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72742/#Comment_72742" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T13:46:11+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  1:46PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>What puzzles me is that I've had players take me aside and bitch about how their input is constantly ignored by the GM.

I've never played an indie game with someone, then had them angrily declare they'd never try it again. I've had some people say it wasn't totally to their liking, I've even had one guy be a bit of a dick and it was clear to me he wouldn't enjoy playing again, but that was a one-time thing.

You've made the game as much as the GM, so you're just as responsible if it sucks.<br><br>Hmm, maybe that thesis is its own thread.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72750/#Comment_72750" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T14:20:43+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  2:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike Holmes totally nails it, as he is so often prone to do.  Good show, man.<br><br><br>One thing I noticed earlier that I feel like adding:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>I'm thinking you could also cite various sports that put a player in a "captain" position, e.g., the quarterback in football. However, I think there's generally an expectation that the person has to earn their keep. If said quarterback keeps calling lousy plays and can't hit the broad side of a barn, he's not quarterback for long.<br><br>Is the same thing true for RPGs, though? Or do groups end up sticking with DM Joe because they had fun with him once, and hope that it'll happen again at some point? 410th time's the charm!</br></br></blockquote>\nWhat I see happening, and what I think is the real problem with the "GMing is a mysterious art" idea, is that when push comes to shove you can find a lot of players who hear what goes into GMing a traditional game and say "oh <b>HELL</b> no, I'm not going to do all that, that doesn't look fun at all," and so even if you really want to bench DM Joe after the 410th time he fails to deliver the goods (or even after the fourth time, as is more likely), you simply don't have anyone else who's willing to step up and take his place.<br><br>The wrong part isn't that they're playing a game with a GM, it's that the way they think of the GM role (as a highly specialized and labor-intensive job which is often also characterized as thankless, grueling, and difficult to master) actively pushes many players away from even trying it, which is often disastrous for the entire group.  If the idea that "this is really hard" is deeply ingrained, you can't even get 'em to try a more collaborative setup, because they'll see things like framing a scene as "the GM's job" and flip out because <i>obviously</i> that's too much work and too difficult and they're going to suck at it.<br><br><br>Honestly, I often get that vibe from some of the discussions here: any time someone advocates a collaborative story game entirely on the basis of "because GMing a game is too much work," I cringe a little inside.  In many cases taking on the traditional GM spot is a <b>lot</b> of work, sure.  If you don't have a fair amount of free time or energy to put into running a game, you probably shouldn't commit to doing it.  But it's FAR from being impossible, or painful, or insanely demanding, and there are absolutely ways that some of the work can be distributed among the players even without going the fully-collaborative route (often ways that are extremely rewarding!).<br><br>Hell, if a junky "Be a Better Manager in Seven Days" self-help book can improve how you run your game (and I totally believe that it could), it should be perfectly obvious that GMing a game can't be all that scary.  I'm a big advocate of coaxing people out of their defensiveness by demonstrating that their fears and misconceptions are neither universal nor eternal, so that they can get to the point where they're willing to convince themselves to try something new.  Perpetuating the "GMing is REALLY HARD" mystique works against that, I think.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

In what you say, the solution is obvious: listen to people and accept what they're interested in.  Don't be overzealous in pushing your own preferences over other people's.  Before you came into this thread with your talk of brain damage and the story-gaming elite, I had posted the following: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Kim</cite>Personally, I suspect that the manner in which people are approached has a lot to do with it. I haven't had trouble getting my fellow gamers to try out story games. For example, there's a group of players that had been playing GURPS that I played with occaisionally. We still play GURPS, but we've also tried Dogs in the Vineyard, Dead of Night, and With Great Power.... I think it would have been different if I had come in with an attitude that story games were a replacement for the inferior traditional RPGs rather than just a fun thing to try.</blockquote>\nI think this is at the core of the problem of "backlash" that Caesar_X expressed in the his original post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72917/#Comment_72917" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T12:15:51+00:00" title="May 31, 2007 12:15PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br>I think this is at the core of the problem of "backlash" that Caesar_X expressed in the his original post.</br></blockquote>\nI'd like to think tat I never presented the games I wanted to try as superior.

I was interpretting Caesar_X's description of "backlash" as being a more specific reaction.  <br/><br/>We could probably talk about different sorts of negative reactions, but in my experience they are quite different.  For example, there are a number of mechanic-less larp players who aren't interested in what is to them mechanics-heavy tabletop play.

This point has been magnified for me now that I've played various small-press games that reward me with <i>more</i> fun for <i>less</i> effort.<br/><br/>My issue is likely that the various "new" RPGs I've played feel like such a quantum leap forward design-wise, I can't understand why anyone wouldn't want to play them. I feel like the guy standing outside Plato's cave. Is this is me being blinded by my own tastes? Probably. Is it also possible that some RPGs have moved forward, design-wise, leaving others behind? I honestly think so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72992/#Comment_72992" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T17:43:29+00:00" title="May 31, 2007  5:43PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2007 5:45PM by buzz.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>Also, I've gotta say: D&amp;D (I assume 3.x) &amp; Hero are maybe not the best examples of low-prep traditional games. You could probably reduce your burden by a lot by going to a simpler system--completely independent of whether it calls for player input.</blockquote>\nMoving to a simpler "trad" system would likely involve as much effort as moving to a simpler "new" RPG, in terms of convincing my group or finding a new one. If I'm going to invest the effort, I am not going to waste my time on the former.<br/><br/>I also notice that, the lite-er the trad system, the quicker my interest level drops. Admittedly, I haven't gotten as much chance to experiment as I'd probably like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3178/are-gms-really-the-experts" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3178/are-gms-really-the-experts" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3178/are-gms-really-the-experts/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3178%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3178%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
