She'd been sending me little updates here and there, but nothing as awesome this before that moment.  I was speechless.  Hell, I choked up a little bit here at work and had to walk away from my desk for a few moments.  it was an unexpectedly emotional moment for me.  I was (and am) amazed and astounded, being <i>this close</i> to actually accomplishing <i>something</i> with my own creative energy.  Until this time I've been fueled by eagerness, and only now did it really hit me: I'm about to do this, for real.  Wow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I decided at that moment: it's pre-order time.  Let's see if anyone bites.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've mentioned this game once before a long while back when I used a different username, so I hope this kind of promotion is allowed here.  If not, please let me know!<br/>\n<br/>\n(zOMG)<br/>\n..........<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="CannibalCover_final_web.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://nathanaelcole.com/agames/cancon/art/CannibalCover_final_web.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(the back-of-book blurb):<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cCannibal Contagion is a game of mental stress and violent survival against hordes of infectious supernatural cannibals.  The players use high-stakes playing-card battles to determine the outcomes of their actions, with a heavy focus on pure primal narrative, stress-induced madness, and totally badass action.  These pages contain a complete role-playing game, including rules detailing character creation, mechanics for resolution of mass-character conflicts, methods for generating your own custom Contagion effects, guides and advice on how to set up and run games with little to no prep time, examples of rules in play, and a slew of quick-draw tables to help you jump right in and play with but a moment\u2019s notice.  Read these rules, grab your friends and a deck of playing cards, and get ready for some zombie-murdering comedic survival horror adventures.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPre-orders are available now, to be shipped at the end of April.  All pre-orders will be numbered and signed, and include a free full-color copy of the PDF as well.  Final print will be 120 pages, cost is $20 + variable shipping (I do ship internationally!) - <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://nathanaelcole.com/2009/03/19/cannibal-contagion-now-accepting-pre-orders/" rel="nofollow">click here to order or find out more</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NPC" title="NPC"><img alt="NPC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://nathanaelcole.com/_pics/me/spider.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NPC">NPC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197903/#Comment_197903" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T16:49:37+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  4:49PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            South America... *facepalm*<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have considered that one at least, because both of my internal artists are from Argentina.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the excellent advice.
