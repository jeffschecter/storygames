But the Republic Militia isn't dead yet.  First, they must fight off the PRY's dread Shadow Warriors (Personal Combat), then defend their evacuation launch site from the PRY army (Platoon Combat).  Once the remaining Republic citizens are on a transport, the party must run the PRY blockade (Space Combat).  Finally, the party's enemy, General Thomas, brings them before a Court-Martial on charges of collaboration with the PRY (Social Combat).<br/><br/>Please let me know if you use this and how it turns out.  I've had a lot of fun with it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
