After a few messages back and forth I discovered that I am organizing GoD for the con. We are in a bit of a time crunch, but I am hoping the smaller nature of the con does not result in me getting my teeth kicked in.<br/><br/>Winter Fantasy 2013 will be taking place January 24-27, 2012 at the Grand Wayne Center in Fort Wayne, IN. For those of you unfamiliar with the con it is what D&amp;D Experience was before it was D&amp;D Experience. The con has reverted back to Winter Fantasy now that Wizards is consolidating D&amp;D Experience into their GenCon presence. This change has opened things up, and allows greater gaming diversity. <br/><br/>To paraphrase Steve from an earlier thread, I have a few specific goals for this thread:<br/><br/>1) If you've helped organize or run the event in years past, and would like to work with me to organize things a bit better, please chime in or drop me a line directly. I'm currently in talks with Baldman Games about plans for 2013 and I'd like a small team of advisers to help me sort that out.<br/><br/>2) If you've run Games on Demand at another show (Origins, PAX, etc.), and would like to do it again, I'd be interested in coordinating our planning. Drop me a line or jump into this thread with your ideas.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397413/#Comment_397413" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T19:16:55+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  7:16PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I encourage anybody who's able to attend to step forward, if you'd like to run some games and have a good time.

But, in the mean time I think an open discussion here might be helpful to future organizers. I have experience organzing traditional slotted events. And, I have participated in GoD as a player and GM so I have some level of knowledge in those regards. <br/><br/>My most pressing concern is forecasting. How do you figure out how many GM's and tables you'll need when bringing the event to a new con?<br/><br/>Also, how would I go about purchasing one of those marshalling banners like we had at GenCon this year?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397576/#Comment_397576" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T07:02:59+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  7:02AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You'll be hard-pressed to forecast your demand for this event, since it hasn't happened in that venue before, and because the convention itself is reinventing itself. Better to plan for the number of volunteers you can get. I'd say start small- a room with 3-4 tables (or, if the space allows, individual rooms with one table each), and 4-5 volunteers for a few 2-4 hour sessions on one or more days. This is pretty much what we did at the Escapist Expo in Durham, where we had relatively few volunteers and no idea what our traffic would be like.<br/><br/>The banner we had at Gen Con was designed by Alex Mayo and paid for by Scott Acker. He had it made (I think at Fedex) a few years ago, and has been kind enough to haul out to the show each year and set it up. If you want the design files I can get them to you, but printing it won't be cheap. Maybe you can get the convention organizers to help?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397653/#Comment_397653" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T17:05:45+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  5:05PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty reasonable to me.
