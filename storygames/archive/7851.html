There's it's value <i>today</i>, which is the amount of fun I can have with it in concert with the couple dozen other people who also have access to the product.  Then there's what I guess about its value tomorrow, which I probably hope will be very high, when Clinton's game revolutionizes the industry, and I get fame and wealth from having been associated with his genius.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he then decides not to publish the game, Clinton has <i>in no way</i> reduce the today-value of my work.  He has, however, radically changed the perceived value of my bet on the game's future.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, if someone takes their game off the market after a good, solid run they have impacted <i>nobody's</i> today-value.  They have somewhat changed the perceived value of any bets people placed on the game's future.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I might be so bold as to offer:  Fans of a game are often wildly optimistic about the future of a game they like.  That means that they routinely overvalue these futures, and then when things (often quite predictably) don't work out that way, they feel that they have been deprived of some <i>real</i> value, when in fact they are merely finding that their guess at a future value was incorrect.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173954/#Comment_173954" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T15:56:21+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  3:56PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you can see what speculation did to the world economy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173955/#Comment_173955" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T16:01:45+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  4:01PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">That means that they routinely overvalue these futures, and then when things (often quite predictably) don't work out that way, they feel that they have been deprived of some real value, when in fact they are merely finding that their guess at a future value was incorrect.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nActually, Tony, if you're going to go down this road, they really were deprived of "real" value...it was embedded in what they paid for the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe price we are willing to pay for something is always a combination of that something's immediate utility and our estimates of its utility in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo based on both of those I decide I'm willing to pay $20 for a game, its only $18, so I buy.<br/>\nNow I find that my estimation of future value was way off.

A real los of capital of $3 and a loss of expected opportunity valued at $2 (whether that $2 is $2 worth of fun and joy and utility or $2 worth of resale value is economically equivelent).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the real question isn't whether my expectations of future value is "real" or not.  It is definitely "real".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real question is whether and how much future decisions by the publisher actually do or don't impact that expectation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173956/#Comment_173956" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T16:10:17+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  4:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 4:10PM by TonyLB.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>So based on both of those I decide I'm willing to pay $20 for a game, its only $18, so I buy.<br>Now I find that my estimation of future value was way off.

And I think you're right about it for some folks, but the thing for me that doesn't translate is that the creative community I care about most around any given game is going to be the people I play that game with. <br/><br/>Like, I like (love/hate) Story Games, and I liked making oracles for Wicked Age, but neither of these things are the reasons I buy games. The oracles I put up on Abfuawhatever were things I did for my group, and then figured others might like them so tossed them up. Their primary value for me (other than burning a few hours with a mildly creative activity) was in getting played at the table. <br/><br/>So if Vincent stopped publishing Wicked Age, it wouldn't hurt my community much. I still have the game, I still have the people I play with. I still have all the current oracles on Abfab. I may not get a lot of future oracles from other people, but then I wasn't expecting that much anyway. <br/><br/>And even though posting about Wicked Age on Storygames isn't really the point either, I can still probably do that. <br/><br/>Honestly, there is a real way in which, having bought Vincent's game, Vincent stops mattering. And even if the game goes away, it doesn't really affect me at all. <br/><br/>I get where others could feel different, if a primary plug for them is the online community around a game and the assumption that such a community needs ongoing recruits and continuing publication for the community to maintain quality and life... but that isn't me. In fact, it feels kinda like a very traditional model of the fan community, and neglects the idea that primary sources aren't really necessary for many fan communities to maintain a vibrant life.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173974/#Comment_173974" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T17:58:42+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  5:58PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>In fact, it feels kinda like a very traditional model of the fan community,</blockquote>\nYep.

Asking him to take it down would require effort from me and feel <i>odd</i>.<br/><br/>Hoard is available in print and PDF on Lulu.  I have done nothing to "keep it there", every day.  I would need to take action to remove it.  And it generates a few bucks now and again, some discussion here and there.<br/><br/>Microcosm and The Far Towers are also PDFs, up on <a href="http://www.amagi-games.org" rel="nofollow">my site</a>.  It took maybe ten minutes to put them there; the effort involved is negligible.  They'll both end up available from Lulu as well (in time, packaged with other site material as the "flipside" of physical books), and stay there, effort-free.<br/><br/>There are <i>great</i> reasons to put in more effort than that - community-building, income, and so on.

They affected me profoundly.  I encountered them only because Ron mentioned them in Sorcerer &amp; Sword and then only then because I hunted them through used book channels.  Had they remained available on the shelves of bookstores I would have likely discovered them much, much sooner since I browse the "Fantasy" section at least once a month and would have been impacted much much sooner.  I would have liked that.<br/><br/>But I also acknowledge that keeping something out there in that form really IS time and effort and money.

I'm not sure I quite agree here, either.   I can't seem to agree with anyone on this stuff, which is somewhat unsettling to me.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call it "damage".  That might just be a semantic quibble, but still; the phrase I used above, "cutting short" a benefit is about as far as I'm willing to push that one.<br/><br/>I also think it's very possible that an author might gain some benefit, or shake off some other annoyance, through that (action or inaction, depending on how they've set up their creative works).  The new (and possibly radically different) version of the work might enjoy better sales if they do so, for example.  They might be able to stop bloody worrying about some aspect of their reception or work, or might take catharsis in disposing of an inferior (by their standards) work.  Those are utterly valid choices, and absolutely their decisions to make, utterly regardless of my feeling that the outcome of such is unfortunate. <br/><br/>(Though I will say that I'd really, really <i>like</i> to understand such decisions more thoroughly.

The ideas that I put forth in that, they've been digested and recapitulated by the design community.  Took a while before people were really playing it, and then a while after that before they'd made some of the notions their own, but I do believe it's <i>happened</i>.  New games coming out are showing that.  If folks want to learn about creating story confrontationally, they've now got great games like <i>Triffid Regency</i> and <i>Gorilla!</i> that do it just fine.  If they want to be inspired to play the moral confrontations of superhero stories they're well served by Brett's new <i>Legion of Super-Heroes</i> CCRPG.  <i>Capes</i> is still a fine game, but the torch has been passed.  At this point, people going to it to <i>play</i> would either be (a) die-hard fans, (b) misguided folks who would be better served by the newer coolness or (c) old fogies nostalgic for that clumsy "aughties indie magic."  Time, I think, to survey the landscape with a smidgen of pride, retire this old warhorse with dignity, and fondly pack away my last few copies in the attic to show to my grandchildren some day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174111/#Comment_174111" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T11:11:06+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:11AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 11:21AM by Grant Davis.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>So when you take the work away you just altered the lives of the sum of all those people out to the extinction of mankind.</blockquote>No. "Altered" implies that it<b>was</b>one way, and now it's another.

The whole notion is both (a) intensely illogical and (b) emotionally hinky in some way I have yet to put my finger on.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but I have to interject. The expectation of the future does exist in the present, and it does have value in the present (discounted by the rate of interest). When unexpected changes happen, the present value changes. <br/><br/>Right now, everyone has to form expectations of the future, usually with probabilities of one future or another, in order to make decisions in the present. Should I adopt the Game System License or the Open Gaming License? Should I start a game of Burning Empires or wait until I get my hands on Mutant City Blues? <br/><br/>Further back:\n<blockquote>You lost the value the instant you bought it. The only thing that happened later is that you learned that the value had been lost. Right? </blockquote>\nNot right. The value should have remained the same, or increased, the instant you bought it, because you realized its present value (by reading it, or shelving it to read later) and had expectations of its future value (by running it or buying supplements). If those expectations aren't realized, then the value only drops when you find out that something has changed. EDIT: It could also drop in the present if you read it and don't like it.<br/><br/>Note that "running it" can't be taken away from you, but if the game doesn't become popular, then fewer people will be interested in playing it. You're betting on the future existence of a network externality, a large pool of excited players, which has value until it is realized and loses value when it becomes evident that won't happen.<br/><br/>-Grant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174112/#Comment_174112" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T11:11:32+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:11AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TonyLB,<br/><br/>You're assuming that all that matters are the ideas and not the presentation or even the implementation of the ideas.  Just because other things "say" or "do" the same thing as Capes doesn't mean that those other things will be effective at communicating those ideas to a given individual.  That's because I don't believe that communication is 100% a property of the thing, it's partly a property of that thing's audience.<br/><br/>So I can easily imagine a person for whom Capes would really radically define how gaming is done in a manner that works for them but that those more "modern" versions simply wouldn't do.  I can imagine showing them Gorilla! or whatever and having them not get it but showing Capes and having them go, "Aha!"<br/><br/>And again, I point to my experience with the Kane novels.

There is also no need to worry about whether the game designer is still around to write more supplements or answer questions. <br/><br/>But if you want to run a game, it's easier if your players have heard of it. That's an expectation of popularity in the future where you start a game.

If it is a new game, you form an impression of how popular it will be and buy accordingly.

There's plenty of my <i>really good material</i> that has gone "poof" when its job was done.<br/><br/>For instance, I had a whole big setup on how to run Victorian Amber, with "Social" and "Butler" as two of the attributes.  Folks really liked it.  I put it up for a campaign.  When I closed down the campaign, I took down the information ... so those ideas now exist (as far as I'm aware) only in the minds of a few people who either played in the game or discussed it with me ... and I'm <i>glad</i>.

Yeah, I'll reject that.

It saves your journey so that others may walk it later.  It's like a persuasive essay.  Whatever conclusions you come to may be profound and important but if you can't see the argument that lead to those conclusions no one will understand them.<br/><br/>Games, literature,  movies, all art has genealogies.

That particular reaction has a whole lot of stuff bundled into it, all of which is in my head (and which I will explain, but which I'm <b>not</b> trying to advocate)<br/><br/>In your example, you outline the stuff your game is good at, right?  "If they want X, then they'll be better served by Gorillas!"; X is some part of what defines the game, it's place and value, as judged by you.<br/><br/>The basic assumption of the statement, which is the bit that seems weird to me, is that <i>you could feel as if you knew</i> the value the game has.  I'm not sure that you can know that with any certainty.  When I run a game at the table, I often don't know what value is being gleaned from it by <i>the guy across the table</i>.<br/><br/>Basically, while I understand that you could feel closure on a thing, I don't get <b>how</b> you actually could feel closure.   I get that you can imagine feeling it; I even agree that feelings of closure are a great big positive.  Is it that someone else has expressed the point you meant to make, provided the experience you intended?<br/><br/>Because, well, I think that just about the coolest part of putting stuff out there is that people will do <i>unintended</i> things with it.  There's a huge thrill for me in discovering what I've made through other eyes.  In not knowing what the invention is for.<br/><br/>And that can happen at any point.<br/><br/>That's my head, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174174/#Comment_174174" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T13:55:21+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  1:55PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Posted By: Valamir<br/>\nSo based on both of those I decide I'm willing to pay $20 for a game, its only $18, so I buy.<br/>\nNow I find that my estimation of future value was way off.

It's already enough effort just dealing with the obligations I feel to real flesh and blood people.  I'm not inclined to invent fictional people just in order to feel obligated to them, y'know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

Jesse, are you really saying that you can't grasp that there is a potential for mental effort in something being available? Levi listed a few potential reasons (as did Tony) of why you might want to pull something off the market even when you can leave it online without expending any <i>physical</i> effort. Are you just nulling those and saying they don't count? That they aren't real reasons?<br/><br/>Like, basically, I feel your statement is completely inaccurate. Inherent in it is that since <i>you</i> can't grasp that there is effort required for a designer (a designer who isn't you) to keep material available online, then that means that there isn't any effort. But, you're just flat out wrong. There is effort required. The failing is not in the designer who pulls their material, the failing is in those who can't grasp that they are making a perfectly valid and important decision for themselves. That it requires more effort for them to keep their material available than for them to pull it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>Though I will say that I'd really, really <i>like</i> to understand such decisions more thoroughly.  I think it would be of <i>benefit</i> to all of us if people making such decisions talked them out; a roadmap of "what went sideways" is a damn fine thing to have.</blockquote>\nWhat I find so painful about this line of reasoning (which I feel is the line of reasoning that lead to a lot of the statements made towards Matt and his decision), is that what isn't being acknowledged is the possibility that the reason not to talk about the why of the decision is tied in with the decision itself. Which, as I could see in the other thread, lead to a lot of really shitty statements being made. Because it is fucking painful to be on the receiving end of entitlement (which the quoted section is an example of) when it comes to having your decisions questioned. Decisions that are obviously not easily made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174235/#Comment_174235" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T22:08:02+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 10:08PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>Because it is fucking painful to be on the receiving end of entitlement (which the quoted section is an example of) when it comes to having your decisions questioned.</blockquote>\nThe quoted section in question being Jesse's statement, or mine?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174245/#Comment_174245" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T23:51:26+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:51PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite><br/>I find this odd.

I'd like to.<br/><br/>What mental effort?<br/><br/>If I gave up Play Passionately (my gaming blog) tomorrow and walked away what mental effort is there to keep it up for those to read later?<br/><br/>Hell, back in college I wrote three text adventure games and released them.

What *effort* mental, physical, spiritual or otherwise has it taken me to leave them there?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174249/#Comment_174249" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T02:24:38+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  2:24AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bad economic theory.

Folks really liked it.  I put it up for a campaign.  When I closed down the campaign, I took down the information ... so those ideas now exist (as far as I'm aware) only in the minds of a few people who either played in the game or discussed it with me ... and I'm<i>glad</i>.
