It's really good! You create the dish of the day, the customers and the employees. (The employees are based on the ingredients in the dish: so, for example, the landlord of the tavern might be based on a Honey Roast Pig.) Then you play the employees through the life of the tavern. Some leave, some stay, but gradually, their lives change.<br/><br/>It's a lovely little game. It deliberately subverts various storytelling tropes: for example, you're encouraged not to drive towards conflict or introduce mysteries. Instead, you play through the relationships and see where they go. There is no character ownership, either: the characters are played by various players.<br/><br/>It's a GMless game. You write on playing cards with Sharpies. <br/><br/>But it's really hard to pitch. How can we pitch it so it sounds interesting? What are the bits we should emphasise? Any help much appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389053/#Comment_389053" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-02T15:22:43+00:00" title="September  2, 2012  3:22PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe the term "slice of life" could be used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joanna" title="Joanna"><img alt="Joanna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joanna">Joanna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389054/#Comment_389054" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-02T15:54:17+00:00" title="September  2, 2012  3:54PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's important that the people are ordinary, everyday folk.

Movies, books, other games, something that people will be more familiar with that can serve as a shortcut for explaining your game. Jim already called out <i>Cheers</i>, which is probably the closest thing Americans have to a common idea of a tavern. How about "it's like <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>, but they never leave the Winchester and there are no zombies." Are there other better references you can use?<br/><br/>How about telling potential players what they can expect to get out of it- at the end of the session, what will we have accomplished? When we're playing, how do we know when we're doing it right, and when the game is done? <br/><br/>Based on what little you've said so far, I can easily imagine that one answer might be "you're playing to find out why all these people are here, and why they keep coming back.

Probably the only other part of the game I'd include in the pitch is the shared ownership of characters and the absence of driven conflicts, but I'm not sure how to phrase those in a cool and pithy way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389083/#Comment_389083" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T05:30:45+00:00" title="September  3, 2012  5:30AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I would somehow include the intended genre and time frame for sure.

To answer Steve's questions:\n<blockquote>What's the scope of the game's story? Is it one day in the life of the tavern (and it's occupants), or does play stretch over years (or some other interval) with lifer staff and long-time regulars?</blockquote>\nIt plays through several evenings over the life of the tavern. That's likely to cover several months, although it could be days or years instead.\n<blockquote>Is there any mechanic to help front-load motivation for the characters (and thus a direction for the players) such as keys, aspects, or needs? </blockquote>\nNo, there's not.<br/><br/>Oh, there are relationships, though. There are lots of relationships. The game is about playing through those.\n<blockquote>In terms of how to pitch it, an obvious strategy is to point at some other media that represents what you're after.</blockquote>\nI'd really prefer not to do that. Many indie games seem to be pastiches of other genres: it would be nice not to go down that road.\n<blockquote>How about telling potential players what they can expect to get out of it- at the end of the session, what will we have accomplished? When we're playing, how do we know when we're doing it right, and when the game is done? </blockquote>\nThe short answer is: play through the relationships and see where they lead you. The analogy is kneading dough for bread. Work every part of it, but don't overwork it, and you're done when it feels right.<br/><br/>One of the game's central ideas is that it tries to break conventional storytelling techniques. So you're encouraged to end both scenes and the game without everything being resolved. You should leave things hanging.<br/><br/>Thanks, Steve, those are helpful questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389087/#Comment_389087" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T07:35:44+00:00" title="September  3, 2012  7:35AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And there is beauty in the stories of ordinary people.</blockquote>\nThat's lovely.

If a customer is involved, then the customer always wins, because the customer is always right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389103/#Comment_389103" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T09:56:36+00:00" title="September  3, 2012  9:56AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reminds me of "Herr Lehmann" which is a german movie / book.
