Hard to say, without pointing at a game like Universalis (and although I've played Universalis many times, it never fails to bore me in play a little each session). More than "games that exist out there", I'd love to see more people simply talk in a forum (like this one!) about how they would take on these issues in their games. This also cuts out the "read these essays" effect. Coffee talk.<br/><br/>Frex, I've blathered on last year about how using some advice from With Great Power about having players play major NPCs when they were not in scenes made the game a lot of fun... and have extrapolated it into a style of play that I reproduce for just about all the games I play now, *especially* traditional ones: L5R, D&amp;D, etc.<br/><br/>Here's how I've been addressing "Avatars" lately (do you mean PCs here? The characters which each player has singular control over? Just want to make sure): So, playing one character, getting under the skin and all, a character which I have the most control over is really fun for me. It's what I love about roleplaying. So I'm playing mostly in games where everyone has one character which is "theirs", which they control just like I've done all the way back to the days of Star Frontiers.<br/><br/>How things have been different recently for me: Everyone's got that one character... but there's ALSO a pool of NPCs which the players regularly play. It's a kind of shared control: Sometimes the mob boss will be Travis if Travis' main PC dude is not in the scene. Sometimes I (the GM) will take on the role of the mob boss because I have a particular plot point that I want to introduce. It got to the point where I had a 1-page list of major NPCs for our L5R campaign, and next to each was listed the player who had taken on the role the most, as well as the player who had taken on the role the second-most. Almost like a playbill, with "Actor" and "Understudy" :-)<br/><br/>In any case, this has been badass. There's all sorts of living NPCs in motion which keeps things hellishly interesting for us, far more than my old "I, the GM, controls all characters who are not on the sheet in front of you players" style of play. <br/><br/>Director's stance (if I'm remembering things correctly, I might be getting the terms mixed up) is easier to do: Someone will be like, "Oh, before we go raid the mansion, I'd like to meet up with the merchant's wife". And I'd be like, "Shit, ok. So it'll be you then, and (point at another player who won't have their PC in the scene) you're the wife. Go." etc, and watch what happens. As GM, facilitate dice rolls when they need to happen, but otherwise just let everyone get in there and roleplay.<br/><br/>Again, though, I like to do this kind of "avatar sharing" deeply (with NPCs), but while still letting the players each have "their guy".<br/><br/>Hope that helps and wasn't too far of topic. Did you have any specific questions or anything about these "takes" or what in particular you want to see or know more about?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169755/#Comment_169755" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T20:30:01+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  8:30PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, Thanks for explaining 'avatars' and 'director's stance' for this noob.

More than that, the stance by itself don't say what you can change or influence outside of your character: the backstory? Or only the scenery? What happen right now? Or everything? These are very important differences much more important than the stance the player is playing in this half second.  <br/><br/>In short (and doing no justice to the theory behind it: if you prefer a more exact explanation I can give you the links ) there are cases when a player can change (or add to) the backstory (the content), or he/she can have a strong input to the framing of scenes and the situation , or he/she can have a say in the outcomes and plot points, or he/she can narrate the results of the rolls or the draw or whatever. Or all of this or some of this.

This don't seems like any game I know, of all the games I have read/played no one had the player be the one to give himself grief.  This is very, very, very very far from being an "hallmark of indie games"... I think that forge theory would considerer playing like this un-fun.<br/><br/>Are you familiar with the <a href="http://random-average.com/TheoryTopics/CzegePrinciple" rel="nofollow">Czege Principle</a>?  "if the same person generates the adversity and also its resolution in an RPG, the result is boring". This would be the case in a game like the one you describe....<br/><br/>For a better understanding of some principle about these games, if you are not interested in reading the original forge threads/articles, you could look at <a href="http://playpassionately.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, that is much simpler because it talks about game practice and not theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169776/#Comment_169776" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T23:24:17+00:00" title="September 17, 2008 11:24PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            while my example was obviously exagerated, I definitely can think of things I read/seen that would seem to fall into this (perhaps it is my misinterpretation) , it not falling under the czege principal because the resolution may or may not be handled by the player (or i could be talking out of my ass you know whatever) <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Thank you for the game lists (will be tracking down a few and giving a bit of read over) <br/>\n<br/>\nL                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
