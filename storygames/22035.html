(Thanks by the way).<br/><br/>I asked on one of the servers if they ever use this forum. I only got one response but it was informative I think.\n<blockquote> I've posted a few times on story games, but there's such a secure core of people that I'm mostly not brave enough    </blockquote>\n<i>I should also not he went on to say that it was "his fualt not theirs" so he wasn't calling us out by any means</i><br/><br/>I was reading a post today from someone I haven't seen around as much and it got me thinking again about this. I was looking for a response in the commenrs from the OP and didn't see one. It got me worried, I feel I have seen other folks to post then not return.<br/><br/>I too have felt a little wary about posting, a lot of very knowledgeable voices here who are quick on the draw. (I mean that literally, often I have a thought and someone has already posted before I have a chance)<br/><br/>I by no means think it's intentional but is this forum insular? <br/><br/>Additionally is there a way to combat it, or is that not a problem in your eyes. <br/><br/>I would love to hear your thoughts.<br/><br/><i>The irony of a community asking itself if it is insular has not escaped me btw </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482314/#Comment_482314" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T16:58:35+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  4:58PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can only speak for myself, but I started posting last year after years of lurking and I immediately got thoughtful, detailed conversations.

Something that would have been widely outside the main stream of the site 10yrs ago.<br/><br/>I don't know if this is good, bad or neither.

Usually when I think of something interesting to say about a thread, either Paul or Sandra or Eero has already posted it, explaining it more clearly and developing it further than I had in my mind!<br/><br/>However, this is not a complaint at all.  In fact, it is very inspiring.  So I keep reading the forum constantly just to think about all the different ideas that are discussed--often a lot more different perspectives than I see on larger forums with more posters, likely <i>because</i> a tighter-knit group of fewer people is more able to bounce ideas back and forth and continue complex conversations over a long period of time.<br/><br/>I do find it a bit intimidating to post on story-games, since I worry (almost certainly irrationally) that I will look stupid if my ideas aren't already well researched and developed.  That said, when I see other people post half-baked ideas it seems like people are generally very welcoming and willing to engage.  So I don't think there's much that could be done differently other than "be less smart", which is obviously not a good policy.  : )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482319/#Comment_482319" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T18:41:39+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  6:41PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2019 6:45PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 22</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, I could see myself being amused by a "be less smart" policy. We could all pretend that we <i>haven't</i> been gaming for 20+ years each, for starters. Maybe everybody picks just three rpgs to "know", and then forget that any others ever existed. Do our best to think like teenagers. We could trade in preconceptions a lot after that. Could be fun.<br/><br/>My newbie persona has for simplicity's sake played <i>Runequest</i> (instead of certain Finnish Runequest knockoffs), <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> and let's say <i>Cyberpunk 2020</i> for a realistic, even spread. I've always wanted to try <i>MERP</i>, but it's too complex for me. Unlike most roleplayers I've never played D&amp;D, and my preconception about gaming is that it is extremely hard to manage a continuous campaign for more than 2-3 sessions before the incoherent mess that we make peters out.<br/><br/>I suppose I'm on the forums to tell everybody about my Improvements to the Basic Roleplaying System. (It's highly streamlined but doesn't do anything in particular; think Fudge.) I also think that I am very smart for having adapted the MtG expansion "Fallen Empires" into a rpg campaign - I call it that, but in reality I've got nothing more than a vague map and an even more vague idea of the campaign activity being "adventuring", but in such a way that allows me to talk about Magic cards with the other players. Plus there's this like dwarven empire in there that keeps human slaves, that's cool.<br/><br/>It's a shame April Fools Day already came and went. We could've have a full diurnal cycle of outright tomfoolery with this concept. Maybe do it on May 1st; sounds better than drinking oneself into stupor as per the standard Finnish social program.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482320/#Comment_482320" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T19:04:35+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  7:04PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2019 7:05PM by yukamichi.">edited April 22</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about "insular," but I do tend to think of S-G as a rather specialized tool when it comes to discussing gaming.

I'm already trying to think of what my three games are! Definitely <i>Fudge</i>. Maybe I should constrain myself to five-letter acronym games? <i>Fudge</i> (originally "FUDGE" - Freeform Universal Do-it-yourself Gaming Engine), <i>GURPS</i> ("Generic Universal Role Playing System"), and <i>CORPS</i> ("Complete Omniversal Roleplaying System") would make a pretty good selection, perhaps. I feel utterly confident that, with those three games - or maybe even just one of them! - I could PLAY ANYTHING I CAN IMAGINE!<br/><br/>It could be freeform, generic, or completely omniversal, depending on which of the Three Varieties of All Possible Roleplaying I wish to engage with. (And, actually, I secretly think that I could combine rules from all three games in order to create the Ultimate RPG!)<br/><br/>Except I like to break the rules, so I also fantasize about playing <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/9026/game-designers-give-up-youve-been-outdone/p1" rel="nofollow">Metascape II</a>, which is clearly superior to them all.

I've had a lot of people private message me over the years to thank me for engaging with them, and it's been really nice. I see lots of other posters heartily welcoming newcomers, as well (as can be seen from the "Welcoming thread", as <a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">@Hopeless_Wanderer</a> points out).<br/><br/><b>My experience with Story Games</b> has been as follows:<br/><br/>1. It's a small enough forum that the content being discussed depends heavily on whoever's highly active at any given time.<br/><br/>For instance, Sandra's presence always means that D&amp;D5e gets discussed a LOT - she's a very active poster, engages in topics with passion as well as thoughtfulness, and almost exclusively posts about 5e. That shows clearly from which threads are "at the top" of the forum.<br/><br/>In the past, we've had a wave of OSR discussions (correlating with Eero's interest in old-school D&amp;D, I'd say), and, before that, periods of forum-wide obsession with Apocalypse World, Red Box Hack, and In a Wicked Age..., as well as high interest in newer D&amp;D (generally, whenever a new edition comes out).<br/><br/>I think this is fine and natural, but I can see how a visitor might conclude (from a quick snapshot) that those games and only those games are discussed here. That's a shame, but I don't really see what we can do about it.<br/><br/>2. It's an incredibly welcoming and open-minded place, and interested in a huge variety of topics and styles of play. As Sandra says, being aware of the concept of "coherence" allows us to be better about discussing a variety of playstyles, which is rare elsewhere (since many/most gamers confuse their personal experiences and preferences with what is "good fun" and anything else is, therefore, WrongBadFun. This is why I'm here - I love that.<br/><br/>However, I also know that people do either stay away or come and leave, and that some people feel excluded, worried, or nervous. I don't want to disbelieve the people who come forward and say that. See this older thread, for example, back when Story Games hadn't lost everyone to G+ and other platforms yet:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/14448/please-read-first-post-before-replying-history-of-silencing-people-of-color-and-women" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/14448/please-read-first-post-before-replying-history-of-silencing-people-of-color-and-women</a><br/><br/>I don't really know how square these two things with each other. Is this just as good as gets? Are some people always going to be scared to participate, no matter what? Or are we actually doing something wrong?<br/><br/>In the case of the "silencing" thread above, for instance, I feel pretty confident that there were just a very small handful of participants who were "poisoning the well" for everyone else (and often doing so in private messages). There's only so much that can be done about something like that (and it also seems to me that those people left long ago).<br/><br/>Perhaps it would be good to hear from people who ARE willing to participate but may have negative experiences or ideas to share. For example:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf" rel="nofollow">AsIf</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Yes.</p></div></blockquote>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy" rel="nofollow">ParadoxBoy</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Incredibly so.</p></div></blockquote>\nWill you tell us what you meant, and why? And, if you have any ideas, on how we might improve things?<br/><br/><br/><b>My experience with the wider internet</b> tells me that lots of people out there have strong opinions about "story gamers", which may or may not be founded in reality - e.g. how TheRPGPundit refers to people who play and design this kind of game "swine". <br/><br/>I guess those various experiences, rumours, and prejudices might lead people to assume that a forum called "Story Games" would share a lot of those negative qualities, just from the name. <br/><br/>In practice, though, I haven't seen that. It's arguable that (especially in the last few years) D&amp;D and OSR games are the most popular topic around here.<br/><br/>Sometimes people with those attitudes come here and try to stir up some rather unhealthy debate. We're generally not able to deal with that productively, and get sucked into their traps. Most of the "nasty" conversations I've seen on Story Games were with someone who came in and somewhat deliberately tried to start a fight. Perhaps we could get better at shutting that down, or responding more carefully. Not sure.<br/><br/>(For an example, there's an attitude in some circles that Story Games are virulently opposed to OSR gaming, and... I don't know? Sneer at people who like them? Something like that. Our own <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a> wrote some essays/posts about debunking that idea which were quite comprehensive and, I think, very convincing. But the idea persists. Where did it come from? I don't know. Check out these links if you want to see his methodology and findings, as well as random samples which show which games get discussed here, year by year.)<br/><br/><a href="http://jdcspot.blogspot.com/2016/07/is-story-hyphen-games-dot-com-hostile.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jdcspot.blogspot.com/2016/07/is-story-hyphen-games-dot-com-hostile.html</a><br/><br/><a href="http://jdcspot.blogspot.com/2016/08/less-math-rpgs-talked-about-on-story.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jdcspot.blogspot.com/2016/08/less-math-rpgs-talked-about-on-story.html</a><br/><br/>(His posts also discuss the attitudes that people from the "outside" seem to ascribe to this community, which could be a good introduction to this whole topic.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebear" title="ebear"><img alt="ebear" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebear">ebear</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482379/#Comment_482379" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T05:02:16+00:00" title="April 23, 2019  5:02AM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been lurking forum for about a year and half and I only started responding to threads here recently so I thought I'd share my experience. I don't really know if this forum is insular or not, and I don't know if that would be good or bad.<br/><br/>I came here I think because my google searches kept taking me here. I would start reading a thread and not exactly understand what was being said, so then I would re-read it and end up staring at my ceiling and thinking about it for many hours past when I should be asleep. It was pretty uncomfortable, but it was also exactly what I was looking for. There's a quality to the questions that I have that's hard to describe. I want to understand how all this works not because I think it will make me better at anything but simply because I've got to know. Basically I need the jargon and the way people drill down into questions on threads here even if I lose sleep over it.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" rel="nofollow">Kenny_J</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I asked on one of the servers if they ever use this forum. I only got one response but it was informative I think.<br/><br/></p><blockquote> I've posted a few times on story games, but there's such a secure core of people that I'm mostly not brave enough    </blockquote></div></blockquote>\n<br/>I definitely relate to that and can try and point at the stuff that makes me less likely to post on here. Like the person <a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">@Kenny_J</a> quoted I do feel like a lot of it comes more from me than anything else.<br/><br/>1. This forum goes way back, I'm never gonna read it all. I'm most interested in the current conversations, but without reading the old stuff I worry about asking questions that have been asked a million times. People put a lot of effort into there responses on here and I worry about wasting their time.<br/><br/>2. I write really slowly mostly because I'm not practiced. This post has taken more than an hour, and its probably the only thread I'll respond to tonight. But I also asked a question on another thread here and got a wonderful response in about 15 minutes, and I feel badly that I won't be able to respond until at least tomorrow.<br/><br/>3. Mostly I just really admire all the people who post here and that's intimidating enough. I guess I'm a bit star struck.<br/><br/>I also just seem to care about these topics way to much. Taken all together it's like someone told me I could get up on stage in front of my heroes and talk about the thing I care most about in the world, but that I'd have to explain it all by playing charades. The idea that they might misunderstand me is just to horrible to think about.<br/><br/>Its all really that dramatic for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482385/#Comment_482385" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T07:57:39+00:00" title="April 23, 2019  7:57AM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><small>What follows is a post where I somehow self-centeredly think it\u2019s <em>my</em> fault that S-G sucks and try to disclaim responsibility with weak-ass arguments.</small></p><p><b>1.

I\u2019m neglect looking for jobs because I just want to draw fan art or write house rules.</p><p>I could never run the game that I do if it weren\u2019t for the OSR. The \u201cmirror story\u201d happened in a Lab Lord game. OSR influences the way I prep and the way I run my games. Now, do I specifically want the lower-powered (i.e.\xa0no cantrips), slow-leveling, super-lethal aspect of OSR? No, I\u2019m kinda neutral on those three issues. IDGAF about power level, speed of leveling, or lethality. I\u2019m happy with 5e+my mods.</p><p>Maps &amp; keys &amp; random tables are the lifeblood of my games. OSR taught me that.</p><p>I read tons of OSR modules and OSR games and OSR blog posts.</p><p>The term \u201cswine\u201d was and is stupid because it\u2019s unclear if it means 90s style games (\u201cstorytelling\u201d, Theatrix, latter-era WoD) or if it means 00 style games (\u201cStory Now gaming\u201d, Fiasco, Montsegur).</p><p>OSR was a reaction to, uh\u2026 \u201cincoherence\u201d\u2026 (???) within D&amp;D play. Railroaded adventure paths where the players spent ten weeks making their builds and then the combats were all smoke &amp; mirrors because the DM fudged die rolls, HP or both behind the screen.</p><p>It\u2019s clear that the 90s style game (heavy on the player side, illusionist &amp; unprincipled on the DM side) was going nowhere. And RPGs were a dwindling hobby. Far from the fad days of the early 80s.</p><p>There were two reactions to this. One was Story Now. \u201cIf we want a traditional narrative, let\u2019s make a game where we <em>create</em> one, together, instead of just having a frustrated novelist DM/Storyteller\u201d. And this was fucking awesome. Not that I think Sorcerer or Circle of Hands are good games (I strongly dislike both) but there <em>are</em> some amazing designs from that (\u2026 from this?) community. I still play and love these games occasionally. Microscope being an example of one that struck an exceptionally strong chord with us.</p><p>The other reaction was the OSR. 90s style games aren\u2019t working. What <em>did</em> work? How come <em>B4 The Lost City</em> is so awesome and <em>Wrath of the Righteous</em> sucks so much?</p><p>I certainly have a lot <em>more</em> affinity for OSR\u2019s game designs than I do for the typical \u201cStory Now-style game\u201d.</p><p>And, both branches found the same solution.

It has implicit references to ancient bestiality in it, what with them D&amp;D monsters being humans with animal heads. It's pretty much exactly the sort of thing that sounds like, in case you haven't read it, albeit executed in a very dry and condensed fashion as a text, what with it being a one-page dungeon and all. If you have actual reservations about it, I encourage you to take them up in a new thread and school me about it - I promise to not respond with personal attacks.<br/><br/>I'll also note that you would not be the first person to call me out on my historically-themed D&amp;D being racist, so at least there's social affirmation for that position. If you want to take a look at another data-point, here's <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2cpqi1jvwpraprz/Foo%20Dogs%20of%20the%20Heavenly%20Jade%20Temple.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">Foo Dogs of the Heavenly Jade Temple</a>, another D&amp;D adventure, this time themed around Orientalist attitudes and the Opium War. I seem to remember that it was judged similarly for being a horribly racist thing some years back.<br/><br/>To be clear, I decided to reply to this directly because I do not mind being called out on the topic of what roleplayers like me should think, play and publish. Critique should be a good thing, and preferable to being ignored. It does upset me when I am accused of racism for doing what I myself consider serious and thoughtful art, but that's just a necessary part of the process - I don't believe in coddling, and don't want that treatment for myself. I disagree clearly and fully with the kind of cultural philosophy that produces these condemnations, as I view it as damaging to progressive cultural endeavours; however, I think that the discussion is a good thing to have, even if people disagree, and that people should be able to voice their disagreements without being hurtful about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482412/#Comment_482412" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T16:54:30+00:00" title="April 23, 2019  4:54PM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not about particular games, but rather that the dominant culture here has sometimes surprisingly antagonistic views on certain topics, people, techniques or types of conversations.

Not necessarily for his purly welcoming nature, of which he is also and so are many others. <br/><br/>To say it another way.

It's definitely what's kept me around. <br/><br/>But I think Paul goes above and beyond (and of course not only him but he's just such a prolific poster) with regard to a willingness to think differently about a subject to try and meet folks where they are.<br/><br/>I think there's a sublte but important different here.

I don't think I engaged with your topic in a way you wished I did. From my perspective, you were trying to redefine the term in such a way is to make it utterly meaningless, and that made the whole conservation somewhat pointless. You, in turn, called me an "ideologue" (although I have no idea what ideology you were referring to), and we never got anywhere.<br/><br/>Perhaps I could have found a better way to say that, but, on the other hand, I still stand by my conviction on that point. If you do feel that's an example of an "unwelcome discussion", is there a way someone could voice disagreement without making you feel unwelcome?<br/><br/>My own negative experiences with Story Games have been roughly of three types:<br/><br/>1. Sometimes an 'outsider' appears and tries to rile people up (like Zak S., perhaps, when he used to visit, and then post about us in scathing terms elsewhere on the internet). It seems likely, in those cases, that it's deliberately malicious.<br/><br/>2. I've started quite a few threads that have been shut down by moderation, because they touched on or pointed at some very unpleasant topics and were likely to make people unhappy. Thinking it over, I'm glad those threads were shut down, and it was a good learning experience.<br/><br/>3. I often step forward to criticize "popular" games (like Apocalypse World, for example), and get a lot of pushback from major fans of the game, who treat me as someone who doesn't know what he is talking about (or just doesn't "get" the game). I am told over and over that I'm just not "getting it", and that someday I will. That's frustrating; it often takes multiple threads and repeating myself dozens of times to get people to stop making "rebuttals" that I'm already well familiar with, and to recognize that I actually do know what I'm talking about (or, at least, am not speaking from complete ignorance). <br/><br/>If anything, though, that happens far less here than on other platforms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482422/#Comment_482422" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T18:54:09+00:00" title="April 23, 2019  6:54PM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Meh.

It might not send such a strong signal about how very much you care about the cause, but it might work better in convincing people about it. Speaking of political history as a whole (something of a hobby, that) I'd say that moderate approaches have often done much more for causes than strident radicalism would.

The historical record is replete with examples of sheer tragedy wrought by failed revolution; we cannot only take the successes and coldly discard the failures with a blithe reference to the blood that waters the soil of revolution. A revolution risks failure from both outside and inside, as we well know; humans are not very good at organizing fairly even in good conditions, chaos and strife are a friend to opportunists who would use the revolution to their own advantage. Moderation also has its success stories, led by people just as committed to the cause of the oppressed, only more cunning and realistic in some ways.<br/><br/>Let's not get into a general political chat, though - it's against the forum's rules and spirit. I am generally the first to encourage not taking the "no politics" idea too literally, because art is so very fundamentally political, but "moderates versus radicals" is no rpg topic any more, I'm sure everybody agrees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482508/#Comment_482508" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-24T20:09:35+00:00" title="April 24, 2019  8:09PM">April 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this an insular community?<br/><br/>Well, given that this thread is dominated by the small number of regular posters...yes?<br/><br/>Did anyone else read the thread from 2011?

I learned more on gender here than on any other forum, but it doesn't change the fact. I guess there is something about jargonning and wanting to look competent and all, a kind of "workshop talk" that has got to change. That would entail more actual play talk. A necessary detour to lead more easily into the design part. I am felling my way here.

I hesitate to say that I'm an example of non-insularity myself, being as how I've become a bit of a hermit from the general rpg scene over the last decade, but I do have a lot of <i>knowledge</i> on roleplaying in general. If others were to be in the same situation, we could characterize the forum as "not many people, perhaps not up to date on the latest coolness, but deeply experienced". I could see calling that insular or non-insular depending on what you're looking at: is insularity the same as not having a lot of cross-pollination with other fora, or is it being generally ignorant of the hobby? I feel like I'm insular in the first sense, but not in the second.<br/><br/>Whatever the word itself means, to me it seems like the forum is welcoming enough , but not particularly popular. That is, marketing-wise we don't know if the product is bad (people don't want a forum like this), or its presentation is bad (the forum seems boring/useless/whatever on a surface glance), or if its marketing is bad (there is no marketing, is there?). Could be any one of them as long as it's not researched any further, but I suspect that the forum has relatively low numbers nowadays because of either the product or the marketing. The presentation seems fair enough to me, I don't off-hand see anything to change that would have a major effect; I'd be more inclined to assume that this kind of forum isn't of interest to the vast majority of Internet-goers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

I always thought that its 'slow thoughtful pace' and sort of 'family atmosphere' were some of its greatest merits.<br/><br/>Looks like a lot of you miss those old intense days but for me the current one is the golden era. (Even if we have areas to improve. <br/>The 2013 thread about empowering women gamers and the new one about * of Ancients were very illuminating)<br/><br/>Maybe this different experience and expectation is why I originally reacted to the OPs question as to a threat e.g. risking good results for uncertain outsiders.<br/><br/>I would definitely try to improve for myself and for other posters (I still have no idea what is Aviatrix problem with the forum community).

(And, if I can do that better, I\u2019d love to learn how!)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> Or <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18301/women-in-gaming-communities/p1" rel="nofollow">this horrorshow from 2013</a>? </p></div></blockquote>\nI\u2019m quite curious about this. I didn\u2019t read the 2011 thread (I was likely a part of it, but I couldn\u2019t find it just now) but I participated in and just reread the thread from 2013.<br/><br/>There are a few dissenting opinions, and some disagreement. However, it was a thread where everyone learned a lot. Everyone spoke politely and intelligently, and everyone seemed to have the same goal in mind. It was unfortunate that the focus turned to the issue of certain gaming spaces being closed to men-folk, but that is a touchy topic, and we managed to steer ourselves back to fruitful conversation. Many people posted to say that the discussion was eye opening and maybe even life changing for them.<br/><br/>Even in the case of contentious issues, the majority consensus appears to be a welcoming and progressive one, despite a few dissenters.<br/><br/>While I agree that there were some serious issues with the conversation, is it fair to call that a \u201chorror show\u201d?<br/><br/>I am trying to imagine the same conversation happening in any other forum, and... maybe my imagination is limited, but I don\u2019t see it going any better. I\u2019ve always come here precisely because I enjoy the progressive and open-minded atmosphere.<br/><br/>Are there places online where this conversation would have gone much better?<br/><br/>I ask out of honest curiosity. I\u2019ve never seen a community that\u2019s open to the public where there would be a lower level of dissent and fewer people asking for more information. (I have certainly seen social media and other carefully curated environments have more progressive discussions, sure, but don\u2019t those environments only function that way by forcibly excluding participation? In other words, if we don\u2019t allow anyone who disagrees to participate, of course it\u2019s going to feel easier to talk about certain issues. But, then, how are we going to reach those people who might most need to be a part of that conversation?)<br/><br/>Again, honestly curious. I am aware that my perspective on this might be totally skewed or that I may be blind to the way this might look or feel to those coming from a different background than me.<br/><br/>It\u2019s just... if this is a \u201chorror show\u201d, what do we call the rest of the internet? <br/><br/>The one thing that struck me in that thread was a constant level of support from all participants, even the ones with dissenting opinions: \u201cyes, we wish this was better, and we are interested in making it better together\u201d. That seemed to remain constant despite occasional disagreements about specifics, and I found that very heartening. Several people said that their minds were changed by that conversation, as well, which is significant (and rare).\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Have things changed that much?<br/><br/>Has any thread criticizing how things work here ever led to real change? <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThat\u2019s a very real criticism. I think there has been some change, but it\u2019s been very slow and very incremental. We could do a lot better on that front.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Does anyone wonder why most of the designers who founded this place have left?<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI always assumed it was because of the rise of social media (c.f. How many people flocked back when G+ was shutting down!) and because there isn\u2019t a huge audience here to reach. I assume that someone like a Vincent Baker would prefer to post on Twitter, not because the quality of the conversation is better there, but because they\u2019d rather reach a larger audience.<br/><br/>Or are there designers who don\u2019t come here because they feel excluded in some way? (I\u2019m not aware of any, but I\u2019d love to hear if that\u2019s the case. I\u2019m sure there are some, but I\u2019m not aware of any trends along those lines.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Or why there are so few women regulars here?<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI may be ignorant on this point. Are there rpg design communities that attract a lot more women? (Again, aside from social circles.) <br/><br/>And quite a few of our \u201cregulars\u201d are women, as far as we can tell from their handles. (Sandra, Lisa, Emma, and Aviatrix, for instance, are all regular contributors who are very highly visible in the community, and Sandra probably generates more discussion than any other single poster.) A few people in this thread have said that they are here precisely because they enjoy the gender diversity among the posters, and find it more balanced than other forums.<br/><br/>Still, we can and should be doing more. I\u2019m glad discussions are under way. The community as a whole seems very ready to try to adopt changes, as far as I can see, and that\u2019s promising.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Or why this place is so disconnected from what's going on in the mainstream of indie design I see in places like twitter or, god help me, Facebook?<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nNot sure about this one. I\u2019ve always assumed it was just the effect of the popularity of social media.<br/><br/>As a contrast, G+ was very popular for RPG discussion, to the point of seeming like THE central place for that online. However, every non-gamer acquaintance (and even most gamer friends) I\u2019ve ever spoken to about it had no idea it even still existed or that there were people using it. Does that mean that G+ was just as insular? (I don\u2019t know.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I see no point in ragequitting or flouncing, so I'll do neither. But I also won't recommend anyone who asks me that they come here.</p></div></blockquote>\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not leaving! You add a lot of value to this community and I\u2019m always incredibly happy to see you posting in any thread.<br/><br/>Curious:<br/><br/>Where do you recommend people go, instead? <br/><br/>Thanks, again, for being brave and going against the prevailing opinion somewhat - it\u2019s really appreciated and I hope you\u2019ll have more to say, if you\u2019re willing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482675/#Comment_482675" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-28T04:42:49+00:00" title="April 28, 2019  4:42AM">April 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the Story Games forum for its mix of bright, experienced, friendly and open-minded people.<br/>If the posts weren't often seemingly unnecessarily long for my taste, I'd be much more engaged.<br/><br/>What is a great turn-off to a lot of people in my opinion are these <i>lengthy responses &amp; discussions</i>. While this is great on some topics, I think a lot of players &amp; designers would like to get <i>brief &amp; concise</i> answers to their questions.<br/>Certainly everywhere else on the internet, most expert forums (and in a way this is an expert forum) make an effort to keep their responses as focused as possible.<br/>On SG, people seem to love to discuss topics as much as possible, not as concise as possible. While this is the accepted modus operandi on SG, I feel this as a certain disrespect of readers" limited time and attention.<br/><br/>There were many topics that I have discovered on SG. But when I saw the lenghty posts, I didn't feel like catching up and joining the conversation.<br/>How do you find the time to write &amp; read that much on a forum? Who has so much time in the modern world? I believe this creates a forum with a very limited audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482806/#Comment_482806" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-01T06:13:57+00:00" title="May  1, 2019  6:13AM">May 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It\u2019s just... if this is a \u201chorror show\u201d, what do we call the rest of the internet?</p></div></blockquote>\nA place where I never ever go!

But we should always be on the lookout to improve how we talk to each other and to learn to treat each other better. From my perspective, Story Games is pretty good at that - but I\u2019m aware that may not be he case for everyone, which is why we\u2019re having these discussions now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482828/#Comment_482828" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-01T15:59:06+00:00" title="May  1, 2019  3:59PM">May 1</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2019 5:26PM by Kenny_J.">edited May 1</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" rel="nofollow">hamnacb</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Maybe this different experience and expectation is why I originally reacted to the OPs question as to a threat e.g. risking good results for uncertain outsiders.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI wonder now if others have felt similarly, that me proposing that SG could a have problem (being insular to newcomers and other groups), means I want SG as it is now to go away.<br/><br/>I can see where coming from here I think, if you <i>like</i> a place and someone is suggesting it might <i>not</i> be as great, could definitely make folks feel like I and others are saying we want the thing you like to change or go away.<br/><br/>I think life and evolution has trained us to see many things in a territorial and zero sum game sort of way. If others "win" or get what they want, well it must naturally follow that we "lose"<br/><br/>So I guess I hear you that SG has been a great place for many of us (me too by the way) and I don't want it to change those aspects. I'd just like to make sure we can make it work for many others too if we can. You certainly can't make everyone happy but I'd like to know I've done everything I can. <br/><br/>To put it another way, I think this can be a win win situation.

I suspect most of us would rather be playing or talking about games. And she doesn't <i>owe</i> us a response on this thread or topic. If she wants to be done with all this that's her call. <br/><br/>Furthermore, what's she's said already is not invalidated because she doesn't continue the Belabor the point.<br/><br/>And regarding others shes refered to, Yes it maybe someone's "opinion" that they feel unwelcome, but that doesn't make them wrong. Obviously some things are inherently subjective, but that doesn't make them any less powerful forces in our lives.<br/><br/>I suspect some here may feel personally attacked, that we are saying <i>you</i> specifically are taking deliberate action to make others feel unwelcome, but thats not usually the case. It's more complicated than that.<br/><br/>We don't often think of culture as we create it, we just act. Our actions have unintended consequences and in aggregate we become a community. I'm only saying if someone says there maybe a problem it's worth examing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482830/#Comment_482830" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-01T16:55:43+00:00" title="May  1, 2019  4:55PM">May 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Kenny.
