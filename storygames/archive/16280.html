He's gotten into a bit of an odd predicament, so I'll relate what he told me over Skype. Sorry if it's not totally clear, I'm working on borrowed info here and just wanted to get another opinion.<br/><br/>He was approached by a few of his non-gamer friends the other day, and they were intrigued and interested in having him run them a game of D&amp;D. Thing is, my friend's general intuition and what he knows from being friends with these guys is that they wouldn't be so hot on the tactical/numbers side of the games, but they were insistent that they wanted actually play D&amp;D in particular. Now, we as a group have only had D&amp;D experience with 3e and a little 4e (didn't like it too much and went back to 3e), so my friend is a bit bewildered. He thinks they'd  prefer the sort of play of a lot of the story games we've been experimenting with, but he doesn't know how to go about trying to convince them that this is probably more what they're looking for.<br/>Based on what my friend told me they said, they're looking for the sort of zany, over-the-top style D&amp;D, which I'm feeling a lot in Dungeon World, and I've heard it similar to old-school D&amp;D.<br/>My suggestion to him was to take a look back at old Basic D&amp;D rules, the old-school stuff, but I have very little experience with it myself. Do you guys think that if they're looking for a crazy D&amp;D adventure without the nitty-gritty tactical pieces, pointing them toward old 1e-type stuff is a good idea, or should my friend try to convince them that Dungeon World or even something else might be more their speed? Do you have any other suggestions for games that fit?<br/><br/>To boil it down: They like the idea of playing "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" specifically, pretty much looking for the brand recognition, but don't know what kind of play it would actually entail. Should my friend give them the D&amp;D he knows how to do but might not be what they're looking for, or try to convince them into playing something else that they might prefer stylistically but wouldn't necessarily have the D&amp;D name attached like they're looking for (plus my friend doesn't have experience GMing outside of 3e)? Could using Basic D&amp;D actually solve both problems?<br/>And if Basic-type D&amp;D is the way to go, got any advice on a running it for a guy used to running 3e? (though he's a frequent player in the story games I run, so it's not totally alien to him)<br/><br/>Oh, and my friend IS going to ask them directly about the tactical thing - if it turns out his impression was wrong and that's what they want, he'll totally run the 3e he knows. But he's usually got a pretty good eye for this stuff.<br/><br/>I hope that was easy enough to follow.

And yeah, he probably could pregen it if they don't have particular guys in mind, so I bet he'll ask them if they already have particular characters they want.

That's the truth, after all, if the guy doesn't know how to run a version of D&amp;D that would appeal to these people.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the guy thinks he can run old-school, then it would make the most sense to do basic D&amp;D or a retroclone - those are the culturally most influential editions, so if you just want to play D&amp;D to see what it's like, then that's the short crash course. Mentzer would be my pick, but that's just me. 3rd edition fails as a beginner-level game and 4th is what it is; of course both can be tricked out, I'm sure, but if the prospective GM thinks that these games are not right for the situation, then surely he knows best.<br/><br/>If I had to do this with the 3rd edition and the kind of hipsters I know, I'd... fuck it, I'd just throw away most of the rules and use one of the 3rd-inspired retro games. <a href="http://www.retroroleplaying.com/content/free-products" rel="nofollow">Microlite</a> does the sort of running around the 3rd edition mechanics that I used to do over several years a decade back, and it's sleek enough to facilitate an old school experience while still using 3rd edition mechanics and math.<br/><br/>If I were absolutely convinced that I wanted to do 3rd edition, perhaps because I was convinced that this is what D&amp;D should be about, I'd play it straight: ask players to develop character backgrounds, perhaps a shared childhood story for their adventurers, then a GM-developed campaign arc that reveals a fated destiny for these compatriots in arms in defense of the kingdom, the race and the universe against an ancient evil. I would definitely attempt to encourage the players to fawn on their characters, this is key to snowflake play: they need to feel that their characters are unique, beautiful and heroic individuals capable of straightening out everything out there. The game will or won't hook the players on the strength of their ability to fall in love with their character visions. Play the rules selectively loose: a player who wants to understand the rules should feel that he can rely on his character's abilities, but one who just wants to narrate fun stuff should have the GM handle all the nitpicky details, with a plenty of "yes" and "yes, but". Cheat like a horse dealer on the dice to provide a sense of danger without succumbing to downers like character death; characters should only die in meaningful situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371731/#Comment_371731" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T12:45:53+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 12:45PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play Dungeon World.

You as the GM don't have play heavy on the rules, and you don't have use all the rules and like every other game I have ever play you can use house rule. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this you can tell your players. Suggested way of doing so: "Look guys I don't think D&amp;D is your style of game, but I can cater to what I think you want with some house rules that will make it more fun for you and me. If you like the style maybe we can move over, later, to a more appropriate game system."<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can adapt D&amp;D to fit other gaming styles/genre's all you need to do is think outside the box.

I think it was Johnz). But some make it easier than others to play Story Games-style.<br/><br/>And John and Userclone, you've done a good job of showing the other side to what Andy and Jason were saying and why I asked about it.<br/><br/>To be totally honest, if it was me (though my friend might feel different) I'd only be debating between Basic and Dungeon World. 3e can be done, and is familiar to us, but Basic is both still D&amp;D and matches the type of feel they seem to want. As long as it's not too hard to comprehend how to GM or explain (since I don't know, I don't actually have the rules), I'd probably go with that and then, if they enjoy that, suggest trying out Dungeon World (in the way Mcdaldno mentioned).<br/><br/>I could do it like Eero and nightweave suggest, but I think it'd be easier to just use the more adapted systems, at least to start with. Using a modified variation of systems like that might be better used if trying to craft a specific experience that no system is already perfect for - namely, it'd probably be best for a medium level of tactics, less than 3e but more than Basic.<br/><br/>Thanks again guys.

I wouldn't have thought this was a very common situation, it's pretty funny to me that yours was so amazingly similar.<br/><br/>And Chris, that's true. Ravenloft is indeed there, but I think it's a very different beast with regard to the experience.

Which was cool and we are having a blast with the maps and minis and tiles and whole Skyrim 'sandboxy' quest xp analogy.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I have been playing Dungeon World for the last year or so with two mates when we go camping, whose prior knowledge of roleplaying as a pastime was synonymous with D&amp;D, so when we played DW 'round the campfire, the boys told everyone when we came home that we were playing 'D&amp;D'. So I can totally go with Mr. Harpers suggestion that this method of introduction to 'D&amp;D' works like a charm. It helps a little to have a few D&amp;D rule books lying around for visual and colour reference though! I particularly like the digest essentials stuff. I reference them all the time when playing DW, especially the monster manual. I also use the Dungeon Building guidelines in my ancient Moldvay rules B51-4  to stock out my dungeons for some lonely DM fun AFTER I have developed the major fronts and dangers, works like a charm. I generally steal a blank Dyson Logos map and go from there. As Jen says, DW is effectively <i>hipster D&amp;D<b></b></i>, which it sounds like the group wants.<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13777" rel="nofollow">Dingledale AP <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371907/#Comment_371907" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T09:14:12+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  9:14AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max,<br/>\n  The advice I give is this, play the version of D&amp;D that you love most. That enthusiasm can carry a player through a less than perfect game and into territory you enjoy batter. If you play a version you don't know or like, there will be no way to come out the other end alive. the first game the noobies in my group were exposed to was a high XP (700+) campaign of Exalted 1e. This is by far the most complicated game we have player before or since. But we were all super enthusiastic about it and it  carried the group forward long enough to try games that they were enthusiastic about. Also, don't underestimate your friends. If their enthusiasm and the GMs enthusiasm is high enough, they c an learn HERO system as their first game and love it. It just takes a level of excitement to pay off the hard work of learning the rules and genre.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371908/#Comment_371908" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T09:29:49+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  9:29AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd do original D&amp;D because otherwise character creation takes forever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371991/#Comment_371991" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T15:23:33+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  3:23PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2012 3:30PM by horn_head_o.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I fully support playing the edition you love the most, but the question comes up: What if you don't know an edition very well?

It's zany and over-the-top but if they were looking for that, they're almost certainly not expecing old school D&amp;D.  That's kind of like someone saying, "I've never seen a movie, but I want something ground breaking and political. The most mind blowing movie ever." And then I show them Birth of a Nation.<br/><br/>Old D&amp;D was made for the lifestyles and the times of 1970s wargamers. If these people were into that style of game, they would already be roleplayers. Or, if not, they'd be hardcore gamers, EVE online fans, or something else with a lot of numbers and planning required for success.<br/><br/>If he's going to do D&amp;D, any style, he should probably make characters for them.  I can't really objectively measure 4E, although that's the most beginner friendly - it's still a poor choice for completely new introductions compared to many indie games. Dungeon World is probably a better introduction - although I hesitate as I think it relies a LOT on being nostalgic for old school gaming (without wanting an old school game).<br/><br/>All in all, he should make sure they really want to play, and give them an indication of what they're getting into by showing them some examples of the rules or character sheets. And then he should run the version of D&amp;D that he knows the best and is most comfortable and flexible with. He's going to be most capable of running a version he's comfortable with (sounds like 3E) and respond to their interest or frustration quickly. If he's trying to unlearn D&amp;D to run an older system that he's not quite comfortable with, then that sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.  <br/><br/>Show them the game by showing his favorite bits about the game. Don't try to please the audience with something unfamiliar and risky.

It works.<br/><br/>Second anecdote: DW works fine without the nostalgia, one of the first games I ran (at GPNW nearly two years ago) had a non-D&amp;D gamer who was probably the most into it at the table. Adam and I are both young; I'm only 26 and 3E was the first D&amp;D I played.

Coming back to Moldvay and playing B/X D&amp;D as intended, without the overwhelming influence of AD&amp;D or Dungeon or 2nd Ed, is such a breath of fresh air. This is the epiphany of the OSR. Basic D&amp;D RAW gives you an experience unlike most and quite satisfying for a broad audience. Dungeon World pays homage to the spirit of adventure advocated on the back of the redbox, retains the tropes therein and does so with thoroughly modern sensibilities. They are both brilliant games in their own right, and do the 'adventure thang'. <br/><br/>I'd go with Moldvay and play a dungeon, and make sure there is a dragon!

If after all these steps the players decide to go encounter the dragon, you've established a compact where it's not the GM's problem whether the dragon is too hard or whatever - the players chose to go for it, they knew that it might be too tough, they should have planned better if they lose.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, after soon-to-be 80 sessions our crew could totally take down a 6 HD dragon in our campaign with 1st level characters given sufficient motivation and a few hundred gold pieces for equipment. I would not expect this feat of green players, but I would still have the dragon because old school D&amp;D is not itself if all challenges are intended to be winnable. The dragon can be there as a tantalizing presence in the dungeon, and something to bring the players back: given that they succeeded in their first foray, do they want to play a second session and perhaps try to take out that dragon they deemed too hard the first time around? Or if they're chaotic risk-takers who got their first party killed by going to meet the dragon face-on, do they want to roll up a new set of adventurers and see if they can take on the dragon now that they know what they're doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372415/#Comment_372415" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T13:00:51+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  1:00PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very true.

Hey, maybe their lack of experience will actually benefit them here, no pre-established assumptions stuck in their head (mechanical ones, at least).<br/><br/>That was more or less exactly what I was looking for, so thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372424/#Comment_372424" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T13:33:02+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  1:33PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's a given in an old school version of the game that the players are responsible for the welfare of their characters. This changes in 3rd edition particularly, and is biggest reason I can see for choosing one or other sort of game to play: if you believe that the GM is responsible for the party getting "satisfactory" outcomes from their adventures, then the basic D&amp;D toolset will be merely mediocre for your purposes, and using e.g. 3rd edition with its encounter challenge ratings and other assumptions about game content might be better. The simplest of things, like how many combats are faced per day and whether combats are even desired, are entirely different between these games.<br/><br/>What I want to say is that these games are more different from each other than they're often given credit for. It's not just mechanical differences, and I think that it's entirely valid for somebody to specifically choose 3rd edition over the to my mind superior basic D&amp;D because of these fundamental differences on what the agenda of the game is. 3rd edition provides a balance of sorts, and it's written specifically from the viewpoint that adventuring is fun and profitable and satisfying. Older D&amp;D is horrifying, absurd survival struggle, unless you go out of your way to change how it plays. If your friend finds it a problem that the new players might get into the game and have all of their characters gruesomely and entertainingly killed underground, then old school is not the better choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372432/#Comment_372432" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T14:34:35+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  2:34PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2012 2:35PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's going to be a one-shot session, right? Ending with a small dragon is perfect.<br/><br/>Give them opportunities to get some stuff that will help with the fight if they use it cleverly, like a potion of invisibility or something. Or a Mace +2 vs dragons called EggSmasher.<br/><br/>And suggest to the GM that they hold off on a breath weapon attack until about the 3rd round, after the players have had a chance to put some hurt on it.<br/><br/>At that point - bring the pain. An excellent ending would be if 1, maybe 2 players got dropped in the last fight, and then they beat the dragon. Holding off a little with the breath weapon should be a good way to make that outcome likely.<br/><br/>After you've planned for likely, let the dice roll as they may. A TPK in a first game is fun too.<br/><br/>Suggest to the GM that he hand each player whose character dies a beer as a thank you for being a good sport. TPK = beers for everyone.

So if he's familiar with 3E but not with Classic, he should run 3E. Pre-generated characters are a must because character generation in 3E is a pain in the ass for anyone unfamiliar with the gameplay (to say the least). Shouldn't be too difficult to find some evocative pre-generated 3E characters, now should it. Then, by all means, do run a dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
