The issue arose from a simple question: should the GM have veto power.  This power seemed most relevant when a player does something that seems, well, illogical and against the story in such a way that it bordered on "power-gaming."  Though a few carefully crafted sentences in the rules seemed to iron out the issue, it got me thinking: do gamers automatically assume that the GM has veto authority?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are your thoughts?  To open this, what powers do we intuitively seek in our GM?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n~Klaus                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323158/#Comment_323158" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T01:46:11+00:00" title="May  5, 2011  1:46AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, veto over what? And in what situations? It's different to say the GM can veto any character action -- 'your character wouldn't do that' -- versus saying the GM can veto a narration of success by the player -- 'that wouldn't actually work' or 'that contradicts some other thing you don't know about the fiction.' For example, most traditional games don't allow the GM to do the former, but absolutely expect them to do the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323162/#Comment_323162" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T02:07:13+00:00" title="May  5, 2011  2:07AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2011 2:07AM by k.graz.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the reply.  You seemed to nail it on the head pretty well: the former was never the issue, only the latter.  And the latter idea (vetoing a narration of success by a player) was where my curiosity was initially.  I still wonder, however, what things are inherently expected of a GM.  For lack of a better way of saying it: what are the basic unwritten rules of being a GM?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Klaus                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323163/#Comment_323163" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T02:25:09+00:00" title="May  5, 2011  2:25AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2011 2:26AM by Wightbred.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it depends on the game.

Is this a problem you've experienced in play? You wouldn't be the only one. <br/>In my experience, there are a few games out there that are all about power-gaming: that is, the point of play is to challenge the players, so if they <i>don't</i> know how to use the rules to their fullest advantage (short of constantly arguing over them, that is) they may not be capable of tackling what gets thrown their way.<br/>As for what you're interested in, and how you GM, and how you relate to power-gaming, let me ask: what games have you played?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323199/#Comment_323199" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T10:03:27+00:00" title="May  5, 2011 10:03AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Zac.  It's not a problem I experienced directly, but one that I could foresee being a SERIOUS problem - especially if/when I let the game go public!  As soon as we get our first rounds of playtesting in, I will let everyone know what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo address your second question - I played A LOT of Unknown Armies, and I'm definitely going to consider myself a bit of a newcomer to story games, per se.  In UA, we did experience some power gaming elements.  It was mostly as a reward for having an interesting character concept, which, to be honest, can be a cool way to reward someone for good RPing, but it stretched things a bit too far at times.  For example, my friend played a Fool Avatar, and was able to get away with pretty much anything.  To me, he seemed immune to the dangers of the game.  While the rest of us were tense, he was given a carte blanche to be free from the tension, even if we knew that the story depended upon our survival!!!  It was difficult to create a certain equality at times, and while we never came to heated arguments, I was definitely aware of the imbalance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323206/#Comment_323206" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T10:32:43+00:00" title="May  5, 2011 10:32AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "power gaming" has a lot of different meanings in a lot of different contexts, so that explanation doesn't really explain anything for me.<br/><br/>So in your game, a player can say something that may be disruptive.  That's fine, that can happen in virtually any game.<br/><br/>But what you really have to handle is how to identify what is disruptive and what isn't. That's the main question you have to ask before you even get to the question of what to do about it.  "GM veto" is one method, there could be others, but unless you know what the boundaries of the problem are you won't know whether your solution (whatever it is) will handle it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
