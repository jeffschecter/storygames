But I could be wrong. I didn't start playing D&amp;D till the end of 2E and beginning of 3E. <br/><br/>Mike Mornard (Old Geezer from RPG.net and super sweet guy) was the DM. Someone called Mike "the original player." He played in Arneson's and Gygax's games before they were even published. <br/><br/>We played 2.5 hours in an art gallery dedicated to D&amp;D art. Given the time restrains, environment, that we were all strangers, and this was a 1 shot, take my observations with a grain of context salt. Although I've also played D&amp;D briefly before with Gary Gygax at Gen Con.<br/><br/>I've played Lamentations of the Flame Princess, Labyrinth Lord, Microlite, and Castle &amp; Crusades before. I can't speak to any of these games in terms of rules as written. I just played and in most cases rolled whatever the DM told me to roll. It's very likely each DM also had their own unique style and 1 person running Castle &amp; Crusades would feel very different than someone else running (this is true for most RPGs but especially here). <br/><br/>What we played didn't feel like most of these games. Lamentations of the Flame Princess came closest. What it did feel like was a combination of Jared Sorenson's Action Castle and David Berg's Delve. <br/><br/>Mike at some point said, "if the rules don't explicitly forbid it, it's allowed." Which was pretty cool. Essentially, "try anything" and lets see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353303/#Comment_353303" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-06T10:03:04+00:00" title="January  6, 2012 10:03AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, I'm so curious.

Like Action Castle, we move incrementally forward, drawing our own map as we went. Light was a huge factor as it determined how far ahead we could see. It did feel a bit like being in a dungeon. I don't know if all the encounters were pre-planned or just the dungeon layout.<br/><br/>It was straight dungeoncrawl due to time constraints.<br/><br/>How this was like Action Castle probably makes sense to a lot of people. The DM is like a parser, they are our senses into a world that is predetermined and very puzzle like. There seem to be predetermined wrong and right answers (stress seem, it could all be made up on the fly and we would never know). And the punishment for making wrong choices was significant and often fatal. <br/><br/>How was it like Delve?<br/><br/>The rules were opaque. I had no idea why I was rolling anything I was rolling, what all the stakes were, or sometimes even my chance of success. <br/><br/>When attacking, we rolled a d20. What hit or didn't was unclear. When doing almost everything else from reaction order to "skill" use to luck, we rolled a d6. <br/><br/>But description, verisimilitude, and nods to realism seemed crucial. We could describe our way into automatic success, failure or simple increase or decrease our odds of success as long as it all made sense to the DM. Anything not explicitly forbidden by the rules is possible. You can try almost anything and the DM secretly determines what it all means. Imagine Action Castle where you can cheat and do anything but you still have to solve the puzzle. But because you have almost no access to the rules (I had no idea what any of my stats meant), you can only use the fiction to influence. Instead of solving the puzzle by using the rules, you solve the puzzle by guessing the rules and playing the DM. But the puzzle itself is predetermined. <br/><br/>Most of the retro clones I've played seemed like rules light versions of D&amp;D 3E without a map. The rules felt more concrete and it felt less like we were actually exploring when we played. But this could have just been how the DMs were running these games. If these same DMs ran Mike's version of D&amp;D, they may have run it the same way they run any retro clone. It's hard to say. Although Lamentations of the Flame Princess felt much closer to Mike's game. <br/><br/>I was surprised the Magic user doesn't have magic missile and the Priest doesn't have a healing spell at first level. Mechanically it seemed as if your equipment and your ability to be creative with that equipment was the most important part of the game. Although I've been told leveling up makes a huge difference. <br/><br/>I can also see why Old School D&amp;D gamers don't like skill mechancis. Rolling a spot or street wise skill takes away from a lot of the puzzle aspect of the original game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353336/#Comment_353336" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-06T13:36:44+00:00" title="January  6, 2012  1:36PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2012 1:38PM by James_Nostack.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not only do you steal my trivia glory, but your Gygax Number is lower than mine?!  OMG fuck you Jenskot!  NERDRAGE<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're steeped in old-timey D&amp;D;, it made more sense.  Dungeon was a mine infested by kobolds.  Abstract structure was a bunch of connecting loops off a central hub, to ensure that the process of play wouldn't be railroaded.  Target number for attacks seemed to be about 13-15, which is about where Level 1 dudes versus Kobolds shakes out.  (If he was playing any tricks on the stats, it wasn't readily apparent.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stats were typical for the three little books - any stat between 7 and 15 was meaningless, and even very high stats didn't mean much.  This is all BTB.  Spell selection and equipment also BTB.  Leveraging your gear is emergent, as in the broader OSR.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe usual rules on surprise and what-not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're into early-days D&amp;D;, it wasn't too surprising.  What I found VERY surprising was Mike's style of running, which was pretty minimalist as far as color is concerned.  Caves + 6 kobolds.  A treasure (value determined randomly--we got SUPER RICH).  We were attacked or ambushed whenever we stopped to discuss plans or do light role-play.  My own timer for this is measured over 2 minutes; Mike's seemed to trigger after about 30 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndividual initiative on a d6, which felt kind of surprising, historically.<br/>\n<br/>\nthings that I know the rules don't handle especially clearly - skill check type things, basically - were 2d6 almost like <i>Apocalypse World</i>, or like the early Reaction Tables from D&amp;D; if you know them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMortality was high but because Mike was running a one-shot and there wasn't time to make new guys, he let them play on with "just half a hit-point."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe color that did exist was usually pretty broad and cartoon-like: at one point I killed a kobold with my mace, and it was the cartoon thing of a guy getting squashed into his own helmet and waddling away.  I enjoyed that, and wished there'd been a bit more of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main thing that I took from the game is that the wacky imaginative, pretend to be a Cleric bullshitting drunk people to convert to your faith, stuff wasn't a strong part of the earliest playstyle.  It seems to have been an opportunistic growth, like a lichen growing on a rock or something.  These dudes were doing a squadron-based war game, with a couple doses of light humor and the occasional funny accent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353338/#Comment_353338" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-06T13:40:37+00:00" title="January  6, 2012  1:40PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2012 1:41PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>description, verisimilitude, and nods to realism seemed crucial.</blockquote>Word.

Mostly because it's about my baby, but also because I think it's important to this game you're describing.<br><br>When you and I played a sorta-session of <i>Delve</i>, I was on the sloppy side with the rules, but here's how dice-rolling works:<br><br>1) Are you trying to do something? If so, see Step 2<br>2) Do you know it'll work?  If so, it works.  If not, see Step 3.<br>3) Does the group really care whether it works or not?  If so, see Step 4.  If not, the GM will just pick whichever's more likely, success or failure.<br>4) Do you have any idea of your odds?  If so, see Step 5.  If not, see Step 6.<br>5) Ask the GM how difficult this task appears to be.  The GM will tell you how hard it is for an average person and then how hard it is for you.  This difficulty level will map to a target number.  Go on to Step 6.<br>6) Roll the dice.<br><br>Knowing whether and how likely something is to work means consulting all the information available to your character.  If your character would know, then you get to know too.

I gave him a copy of the Adventurer Conqueror King preprint and was glad to be able to say "yeah we could tell we needed rules for hiring mercenaries and doing mercantile ventures and sending thieves out from your guild to find treasure maps, now let's see if we got the details right from the hints we found in those original texts!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353342/#Comment_353342" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-06T13:53:01+00:00" title="January  6, 2012  1:53PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!

The industry that has been predicated on selling gamers stuff they don't actually need and would be happier if there was only one game out there that everybody would play (and by that I mean buy).<br/><br/>Ahem.<br/><br/><i>"These dudes were doing a squadron-based war game, with a couple doses of light humor and the occasional funny accent."</i> <br/>This makes a lot of sense to me as an outside observer. The explicit war-game roots have become somewhat lost in the OSR from what I can see, but you still see a lot of the familiarity in how Jeff Rients runs his games, for example.<br/><br/>The way John describes the game is very interesting to me, because it closely mirrors my first experience with RPGs. Except it was D&amp;D 3rd edition, with two other people who've also never played an RPG before. So I think this "primitive" approach (in the sense that Eero uses it) is very much a matter of a certain unassuming playstyle rather than rules as such. Although it's undeniable that systems eventually produce emergent table behavior (like skill checks in new D&amp;D as opposed to classic).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353407/#Comment_353407" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-07T10:20:25+00:00" title="January  7, 2012 10:20AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's kinda fascinating to read this AP and see the reactions to this style of play. What is being described is pretty much the style of play I learned when i first started playing D&amp;D many years ago, and really is my default mode of play, with only minor variations.<br/><br/>A couple of years back, when i was living in Oakland, CA I briefly got involved with a rotating DM game where myself and the other players all had some background in early-ish D&amp;D and tried to recreate this style of play. We all had slight variations, naturally, in playstyle, but most were pretty close.<br/><br/>I did have the opportunity however to play with some slightly younger players ( the core group and myself were all in the late 30s early 40s age range; the younger players were early-mid 20s) who had generally had their own play experience start with late 2e or 3e+.<br/><br/>There was definitley some learning that went on on both sides of the screen. For my own part, I was a bit surprised that the younger players did find play so different from their own experiences with D&amp;D and was left wondering exactly what those style differences were that they found in actual play, since I considered the playstyle the normal state of affairs for D&amp;D.<br/><br/>(Notably, my own style of play was, to some extent, infected with dirty hippy story games concepts however. Most of these involved more open style, seat of pants GMing and taking in player input, or letting players have more info on likley outcomes of actions. Of course, i always tended to play a very seat-of-pants syle of GMing anyway, so the only really new addition to my repetoire was being more open about it rather than hiding it behind the screen, so to speak).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353409/#Comment_353409" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-07T11:13:23+00:00" title="January  7, 2012 11:13AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2012 11:15AM by jenskot.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since D&amp;D is is so flexible, can be played so many different ways, and is often at least equal parts DM, equal parts rules (sometimes more DM), I always accepted no one's experience was quite the same. And play culture is another huge factor. <br/><br/>But more and more I'm finding OD&amp;D to be very different than 2E which are both very different than 4E. 3E feels more like, "do anything" (before 3.5E). Within editions there is still great variation but between editions I was surprised how different they are. <br/><br/>Most of my D&amp;D friends are older (I also didn't start playing till I was 16 and only really got into RPGs in my mid-20s) and it was very surprising to see how D&amp;D means something completely different to each generation. Wizards of the Coast wants 5E to be "D&amp;D for Everybody". I'm eager to see how they will try to make that happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353412/#Comment_353412" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-07T11:54:57+00:00" title="January  7, 2012 11:54AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Shill:</b> This event was loosely connected to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://redbox.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow">New York Red Box</a>, our little old-timey D&amp;D; club.

I've been fondling my 2e books lately, thinking about putting something together, and I'm struck by the <i>continuity</i> with prior editions, at least in terms of how play is supposed to work.  With the supplements, things got increasingly nuts and the settings were these elaborate deals, but the skeleton of play is still recognizable.  Confession: In middle school I played 2e, but it was more like, we were doing our own thing and the rule books just happened to be on the table.  So I don't really have a lot of actual play to draw on, and may not know what I'm talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353417/#Comment_353417" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-07T12:45:59+00:00" title="January  7, 2012 12:45PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should be as clear as possible since 2E itself means different things. And even more specifically, I'm talking about our local play culture. <br><br>2E came out in 1989 but I mainly played <b>2E: Player's Option (2E:PO)</b> which came out in 1995. <br/><br/>In our games, 1st level characters were fairly heroic. In the OD&amp;D game, it felt like 1st level was more like 0 level. You're not really an adventurer yet. Where 2E:PO was much closer to 3E. In fact, 2E:PO looked a lot like 3E and even had early version of feats but without the min maxing. <br/><br/>2E:PO encouraged you to have a back story. Who you were mattered (in theory at least). In OD&amp;D, I felt like I was playing "Player #1" to be replaced with "Player #2" upon my quick death followed by random Player <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233-1&amp;Mode=like">#3-1</a>,000. Kind of like playing Paranoia! That said, 2E often felt like a railroad with its focus on story. It also seemed like the default assumption was that we were heroes and not mercenaries for hire. <br/><br/>2E:PO focused on mechanical skill use over real player problem solving. It felt much more cinematic. Although OD&amp;D feels more dramatic as the danger is heightened. <br/><br/>2E:PO seemed very focused on setting. You weren't just a Fighter, you were a Fighter from Planescape which often meant you had access to specific setting inspired mechanics and options. We rarely fought in dungeons although in reality most of the modules were for all intents dungeons dressed up as something seemingly grandiose. <br/><br/>The major similarities between OD&amp;D and 2E for me are: 1. if the rules don't forbid it, you can try it; 2. the DM can change the rules; 3. everything was very much open to creative interpretation; 4. minimal min maxing (beyond equipment); 5. tactical movement and miniatures are not required. <br/><br/>But... the human mind is a funny thing. Our memories, especially when it comes to nostalgia, are often not to be trusted. This is all what I remember. What I feel. But the truth? I don't know. I'd have to look at the 2E:PO books in detail (the parts we read and used) and talk to my fellow players.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353423/#Comment_353423" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-07T13:16:02+00:00" title="January  7, 2012  1:16PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2012 1:16PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I began play when 2E was new and 0E was old.  <br/><br/>The folks playing 0E liked being retro in a "back to the wargaming roots" sort of way.

Kerry said that he had a game with a mechanic that required players to keep cards secret, and all those guys were like "how will we know that the cards are really what they say they are?" Kerry said well, the game assumes you'll tell the truth and they were like "no, that will never work." It seemed like part of their wargame heritage was looking for any advantage you could get. If you could put one over on the other players, they had no one to blame but their own lack of player-skill that prevented them from catching you!<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise in Chainmail, the way you'd throw a fireball was by looking at the minis on the table, eyeballing the distance to the foe, and then announcing the distance you were aiming for; the referee or the other player would then measure it out. Paul Stormberg told me that Gary knew the width of his knuckles, and would put his fists on the table edge one after the other as he mused aloud on what his wizard was thinking...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://lordofthegreendragons.blogspot.com/2009/03/up-on-tree-stump-2.html" rel="nofollow">Here is founding father Rob Kuntz on this aspect of the game</a>:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">One must remember that EGG's grounding was in table-top and miniature wargames... Now transfer this particular part of his mindset into the D&amp;D; game with him as DM. His opponents were the players, we all knew that, and he did too. This was a game of strategy and tactics, and that meant, on both sides, that outwitting the opponents involved was now at hand... EGG was constantly bluffing and had a poker face. I reminded Eric Shook the other day of a tactic EGG and I both used when DMing, in this instance when parties hit a down slant, elevator room or transporter, which secretly moved their PCs (without their in/out-of-game knowledge) to another dungeon level. Well, inevitably at those times EGG and I would create an out-of-game distraction, and I indeed learned this from him while Co-DMing with him on so many occasions, such as: getting up to go to the restroom. Well, this took the focus off of us as DMs, and the party usually took this opportunity to discuss matters of planning and approach and other details in game context. I'd return to such a scene and they'd still be at it, so as I sat down, that is when I'd turn the page to the level they'd been recently transported to, and without them noticing. This tactic merges with DM-craftiness and keeps the upper hand of information in proper control of course; and this was also accomplished through us telling a humorous aside (a joke)--to which the players responded by laughing--and during the uproarious interlude is when we effected our "changes", the level-shifts, etc. DMs have to be magicians, you know.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe approach that makes sense of cheating as a competitive tactic is pretty much lost in the OSR. (It is unlikely to have been universal even in the earliest days; I heard Dave Arneson say that he should have taken it as a warning when he saw Gary backstab his son's PC, which - factoring out hindsight and bitterness - suggests that the balance between cooperation and competition in the Twin Cities group was different.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the limited-information game is a fundamental difference between OSR and old-school play and storygames' explicit setting of stakes among all participants before the dice are rolled. Within New York Red Box's campaigns, I think I am more likely to be influenced by indie techniques and lay out the possible outcomes of a player's action or dice roll, and Eric's Glantri game is more likely to have you just roll and then learn what it meant. Everyone in our scene is probably less likely than the real originals to keep things hidden entirely behind the screen, but part of what we all want and expect is for the game to be like life, in which you explore the unknown and try to discern underlying patterns by risking things without knowing how they might turn out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI allow a lot of meta-gaming; for me, the part where the players talk about what to do next is like the part of a heist movie where they go over the plan, and just as in a movie you might cut between the planning and the action, I am glad to let the group plan in media res because I really like this part of heist movies and want it to be part of the game instead of a grueling pre-play exercise. (James will attest that it is often both, and finds it grueling!) Not allowing people to discuss their next move seems to promote simulation over gamism; you get to experience what it's like to have to be an adventurer making decisions with little information under stress, instead of what it's like to be a skilled group of heisters whose collective expertise and planning is represented in play by a lot of table talk, and permits the narrative to be about "here are the awesome plans we executed together and what went wrong" instead of "here are the many ways things went wrong as soon as each person acted on their own initiative."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353472/#Comment_353472" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-08T09:57:09+00:00" title="January  8, 2012  9:57AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Groups did vary a lot.

Our games didn't resemble what I've heard of Gygax's or OSR games very much.  On one hand, the ideal was that the GM was sort of like the neutral referee in a miniatures game (although that didn't entirely rule messing with the player's a bit), and on the other, character death -- particularly after 1st level -- wasn't particularly common.

If you know you're playing for many, many hours, and you know you'll be doing this once a week for the next two years, maybe you can approach the experience with a different mindset?<br/><br/>I'm just taking a guess, because I remember enjoying this kind of thing when I was much younger, but now my time has become so precious that I feel like I'm doing something wrong if we take 4 hours just to establish a few non-dramatic details.<br/><br/>(I remember a few years ago I was invited to join in on a session of my high school friends' ongoing Star Wars campaign. They are cool people and fun roleplayers, I got together the GM and made a neat character, and the GM had some great ideas for how to involve the character in the ongoing story. However, once we sat down to play, the players all said, "We need to spend this session making sure our merchant fleet is in order." This meant generating statistics for their three or four cargo ships, determining what the name of the assistants on each ship were, which could carry how many tonnes of wheat or ore, calculating how long each trip would take, and so forth. For four hours. At the end, I believe they used the results to calculate how many credits each of the people on board would make for their wages.<br/><br/>No one seemed to find it particularly fun (especially the GM), but everyone seemed convinced that this procedure was necessary to play the game, so no one complained. Neither did they think there was anything strange or unexpected about inviting a friend (I had traveled for six hours to spend some time with them) to a game where they spent four hours filling spreadsheets with game statistics. No one saw this as anything out of the ordinary. No one felt that they should have warned me about it, or apologized about it, or anything of the sort. That's just gaming, right?) <br/><br/>So, presumably there are pleasures to be had, just perhaps on a longer time-scale. <br/><br/>Or maybe we've been spoiled by games that deliver more bang for the buck.<br/><br/>I'm not sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
