I'm a little confused about some aspects of the game though. I know Shreyas posts here, and I thought maybe he or someone else could enlighten me.<br/><br/>In the "Waging War" section, the text states "The next step in the process is to divide up the social landscape into factions."<br/><br/>Is there a process for this at all? Or is it freeform? I'm assuming the players just kibbitz a little about it, and decide on how many factions they would like to have, but I'm not positive, since the example uses only two. Is having*only* two the way to go, or is that just how many the example happens to have?<br/><br/>My copy of the PDF didn't include anything aside from the rules, although there are references to Character, Set and Prop cards. Am I actually missing part of the game, or are the players just assumed to jot things down for those categories?<br/><br/>I really like the detail the text goes into about how to think and talk about the game ahead of time, but overall reading through it left me a little confused about how I'd go about playing. I'm assuming that I'm missing something here, since there are many glowing APs out there for the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229703/#Comment_229703" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T16:34:45+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  4:34PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Brian! I'm not Shreyas, but I hope I can help.<br/><br/>Somewhere on <a href="http://summerbird.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Shreyas' blog</a> are some character sheets, prop cards, and set cards he made. In practice-- and I think he mentions this in the text? Dunno-- we usually just use index cards. For the prop, all you need to write on the card is.. what the prop is called. NUCLEAR CODES, Xiu Lian's calligraphy brush, twelve red teacups-- whatever it is. That's it. For the sets, all you need to write on the card is what the set is-- Desert, the temple, barbarian lands-- and how many people can fit on the set. As such, I don't really see the need for CARD cards. It'd just be more fussy stuff to print out and prep before a game, and who wants that? Not me.<br/><br/>Dividing the social landscape into factions is totally freeform, sort of in the same way as coming up with a cast of characters. It really doesn't matter at all how many factions there are, as long as there are at least two. Everyone should belong to one faction and have a conflicting loyalty to someone (or a prop, or an idea) that is a part of an opposing faction.<br/><br/>If you've got any other questions, feel free to post 'em. I'm sure we can get you squared away and inflicting emotional violence on your friends in no time. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229705/#Comment_229705" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T17:08:32+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  5:08PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the response, Elizabeth. It is super helpful.<br/><br/>I was almost certain that there *were* actual cards, and that I simply hadn't received them, so that is good to know.<br/><br/>Simply writing the information about a set or prop on a card is fine, and make sense. I wasn't sure if there were more pieces of information for them.<br/><br/>As for character cards, that definitely confused me, and made me feel pretty sure my copy of the game was incomplete. The rules say:<br/><br/><i>Each player should choose a character they want to play from the influential faction members, and then fill out a character card for her. You\u2019ll see on the card that characters have three Displays: a signature Color, distinctive Weather, and a Quirk. </i><br/><br/>I'm perfectly content to make my own character cards, if that's the thing.

A big part of these movies is setting up the "trainwreck heartbreak" that ends with everybody killing each other and themselves because their problems are irresolvable (end of Crouching Tiger, end of Hero, end of Flying Daggers, etc. etc.).  This means you need to start out in the beginning setting up these relationships that will eventually be put under IRRESOLVABLE TENSION.  And making sure the factions and love interests and indebtedness crosses all over the place, like an obscenely tightly bound relationship map that's basically a parody of what would actually happen in real life... that's a good way to prep for it.  Then you just start laying down the tension and watch things expode.<br/><br/>It kinda makes me wanna try a messed up hack of MRG and Jason's new game, <i>Fiasco</i>, which is similarly structured.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229732/#Comment_229732" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T22:19:47+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 10:19PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 10:20PM by Brian_Minter.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Shreyas.

I like it. It *sounds* similar to character generation in In A Wicked Age, which I really like for how well it generates intertwined characters.<br/><br/>As an aside, I don't know how much I got out of the filmography in the book, but a) I love Hero, Crouching Tiger, House of Flying Daggers and the like, and b) I have never managed to enjoy any "old-school" of classic wuxia films, so I like that the focus was on the movies that I assume most people have seen, rather than on the older, less accessible stuff. I can totally see how someone really into that genre might have gone in the other direction.

At that point, they can choose to fight you instead of dying (wirework) and they generally should. You're not playing characters with no deep passions who just choose to die all over the place (I've tried that in play and it tends to suck, like when Shannon Riddle tried to fight my character two GoPlays ago and I lamely chose to just perish; sorry Shannon!), in fact, you're playing just the opposite. So there's not really a counter-demand there except "Die! I won't give you what you want!" (There is such a thing as a strategically placed "Okay, I jut die," like Broken Sword at the end of Hero, but you only earn that after having a long game full of fighting first).<br/><br/>You've got the second one (choosing not to escalate) right. The blade stays unsheathed.<br/><br/>When the knife is getting passed around, I tend to think other players shouldn't interrupt the ritual. Like, if Charlie has the knife, it's between Charlie and whoever he's targeting. If there's a pause in the ritual and Alice wants to take up the knife, that's cool. But you have to let the knife ritual play out and allow the players to make their choices. Then, if someone is left so unsatisfied that they have to do something about it, you return to the knife ritual with a new set of players and characters involved. Otherwise, the knife ritual has no teeth if it can be interrupted from outside and we never get to know what choice someone would have made.<br/><br/>I'm not sure my explanation matches 100% with the book, but that's how I've played it and seen it played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372517/#Comment_372517" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-12T07:34:05+00:00" title="April 12, 2012  7:34AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2012 7:45AM by shreyas.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>If Alice interrupts Charlie's decision and says "to wirework!"

(Redirecting is actually a pretty effective way of denying what someone wants without actually saying "no.") I mean, sure, Bob <em>could</em> use wirework to fight for Alice's demand, but why wouldn't he use Alice as an excuse to fight Charlie because Charlie has been sending love notes to Daphne and Bob is jealous! "Stop being in love with Daphne!" is a way better demand than "Give Alice the answers she wants!"

Making demands with the knife is pretty similar to making "raises" or "escalation" in Dogs, where they specifically have to be "things the other character can't ignore."  Otherwise it falls flat and isn't worthy of the knife ritual.  Like, I don't hand you the naked blade and say "Tell me what you know!" if you're perfectly willing to tell me.  But if I press for information and you beg that you can't possibly betray the trust of your lord, your secret true love, THEN I reach for the blade and bring on the real pressure.<br/><br/>There's definitely the danger in MRG to engage the knife ritual as if it's just like the central resolution mechanics of another game.  Like, when you want to make something dramatic happen, grab the blade. That tends to not work so well.  One thing I'd love to hack into MRG at some point is a fuller post-Apocalypse World description of how the fictional positioning works.  Since you generally use the blade to demand stuff that people REALLY don't want to do, the play before that MUST involve (among other things) <i>finding out where different characters' redlines are</i>, so you can subsequently use the knife to demand that they cross them.  Really, that's what all the indirect implying and stuff is for, before the blade is drawn. You're trying to figure out what people are and aren't willing to do, to discover the best way to get what you want.<br/><br/>Really, MRG is super emo and cutthroat and you really have to engage it that way to get the best out of it, I find. The characters are all people that <i>love something so hard that they're willing to kill and die for it</i>, and they act like calculating, manipulative monsters in order to get it.  I actually just watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Dee_and_the_Mystery_of_the_Phantom_Flame" rel="nofollow">Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame</a> a couple nights ago and, man, nobody in that movie is a good person, even Detective Dee. They're all petty, narrow-mindedly focused on their own interests, and downright cruel. That's pretty important. <i>You are all Lady Macbeth</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372563/#Comment_372563" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-12T12:12:12+00:00" title="April 12, 2012 12:12PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see your play style instantly with those last two sentences.
