Originally published in 1966, it got a reprint just a few months ago:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Chess-Shogi-Trevor-Leggett/dp/4805310367/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Chess-Shogi-Trevor-Leggett/dp/4805310367/</a><br/><br/>Here's the best part, the part that I totally wasn't expecting: In the back of the book is a complete punch-out cardboard set of pieces, and a fold--out paper board: So you don't have to spend the extra 30-some-odd dollars for a set to play it on: The game of Shogi comes with the book. Furthermore, the pieces have English markings on them (letters underneath the kanji) so you can tell which is which.<br/><br/>Anyway, the book is inexpensive, teaches you how to play a kickass chess where you take the opponent's pieces then put them back on the board as your own, and I was totally surprised to see that it came with a complete copy of the game. Total steal at that price, if you're interested in strategy or classic board games.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203690/#Comment_203690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T11:15:41+00:00" title="April 27, 2009 11:15AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does shogi evoke a similar symbolism in Japan as chess in the western world ?

It's regarded as slightly more cultured than Mah Jongg, it's right up there with Go for the "games that intellectual folks play that also appear on national TV on weekend afternoons".<br/><br/>And yeah, the metaphors are similar, as the pieces are similar. Just last week on the latest episode of an Edo-era assassin show I've been watching, the evil magistrate describes the townspeople as "pieces/pawns" in his game. As popularized as it is in the West I think.<br/><br/>Hmmm. Gameplaywise... not sure, unfortunately, which makes it kind of a non-RPG subject, though game related. Nothing more than Go, Chess or Mah Jongg would teach us. There is that uniqueness of "if you capture a piece, you can put that piece right back on the board. ANYWHERE." That might be something interesting in a tactics or dice-based game: Normally in the west, if we return a piece to the board, or add a new element to the conflict, it appears in the "back row", but in Shogi you can totally put it in their face.<br/><br/>For example, my first ever game of shogi, where I was learning as I went along, I was playing my friend Shimizu who is really pretty good (and decent at explaining the moves; my only prob as that even though I can read kanji, a lot of the pieces look alike, so I got confused at times). Anyway, it was going pretty well. Taking pieces back and forth. Playing like a regular game of chess.<br/><br/>Then, he pulled out a pawn that he had taken from me. He slapped it down right in front of my King, out of friggin' nowhere. WHAP.<br/>Shimizu: "Um... Yeah, I win."<br/>Me: "WHAT?  Oh yeah, you can return pieces to the board. You did mention that, I remember now. Poo."<br/><br/>I dunno if that can be translated into RPG mechanics, but it's pretty cool when it happens.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203736/#Comment_203736" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T15:30:16+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  3:30PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Andy, is there a chess variant that uses the Shogi put-your-piece-anywhere mechanic?

Why shuffle off? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So to actually run with your point: Small press printers could probably put together something like that, but I doubt any POD printers could. So you've got up-front costs (possibly big ones). This is GoB's cue, and Jason Morningstar's, as he delivered (with Roach) something fairly similar (cards).<br/><br/>To my imagining, it seems like having perf pages in the back of a book could make the book a bit... I dunno? ragged?... once the stuff is removed. The spine would be thicker than the actual pages, which might cause creasing of the spine or back cover, or could open the way for gradual binding adhesive breakdown. That is, basically, your back cover will end up some millimeters "wider" than the rest of the pages and front cover, because of the loss of the perfed pages.<br/><br/>If it were me, I'd lean towards an insert, especially if saddle-stitch bound instead of perfect bound (i.e. small number of pages). If you KNOW the end user will remove it, go ahead and remove it for them and shrink-wrap the "set."<br/><br/>-----<br/>Also... I'll say that I think Knightmare Chess is pretty sweet: dueling deck design meets chess, making it a far wilder board game. Teleporting kings, blocking walls, suicide-bomber pawns... what's not to love?<br/><br/>-----<br/>For a chess RPG, look no further than the supposed inspiration for Alice in Wonderland (or was it Through the Looking Glass?). Apparently, one can actually play out a chess game using the "moves" of the characters in the novel, except for a VERY wild pawn (Alice) who has free reign to wander the board. So run with that: a board game that uses pieces with a lot of color (i.e. chess, shogi, even Carcaissone; not Go or backgammon or checkers) but require a "fitting narration" of each move. Perhaps even play one of the four-way chess variants, for multiple players (make voting on "fitness" easier). So you're not just "advancing a pawn two squares on an opening move"; rather, "Fnord the serf charges into the field, screaming 'For King and COUNTRY!' even though he knows he's bound for either summary death or a VERY long summer of warfare, staring across the trenchworks at the enemy's serfs, no one daring to try a sortie lest whole swaths of both armies be cut down in the attacks and counterattacks." Basically, just imagine the story being told.<br/><br/>Or, hell, it doesn't even have to use the literal war symbolism. I could see something akin to Vampire: The Masquerade, with the king as an ancient and powerful vampire (your PC), and other pieces being various mortals, lesser vampires, or even government and social organizations under the Methuselah's sway. It's not "knight captures bishop"; it's "the FBI is called in to deal with your "David Koresh Ministry", calling them a band of terrorists and a cult because they indoctrinated those college kids" (captured a pawn or two earlier in the game).<br/><br/>Guided storytelling. Heck, one could even have some bizarre non-win conditions or illegal moves, like "his wife kills him for the insurance money" (you capture your own king with your queen, making her the object to be checkmated)... "but the oldest son finds out and poisons her in her sleep" (your bishops captures your queen, to become the next target). Maybe you get additional moves, if you self-capture?<br/><br/>Yep, I could go on all day with this... but I really should do some work for my pay! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204716/#Comment_204716" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T08:59:41+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  8:59AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also...

Sure tactically you have to keep on your toes so not to missa an opportunity for victory. But the randomness of the game made me feel like people won match mostly because they drew the right card at the right time.

After a few plays, though, you understand and remember most of the cards (just like you remember most of the rules from chess by your 3rd-4th play or so). You start to think about your hand, and what cards they *might* have. So you keep your good pieces apart in case it seems like he has Fireball. Or you descend on their king, and prepare to assault the corners of the board if he plays the Faerie Forest card.<br/><br/>I loved KC (I sold my cards when I came back to the US, still kicking myself for that. I should buy them again). The expansion pack, as you could imagine, was largely filled with poor ideas.

THANKS!</blockquote> De nada, my pleasure.  You really ought to give Gess a go, if you'll pardon the pun - there is an awesomely thick vein of design space around it, as you'll see if you play.  <br/><br/>My favorite gess variant, as I recall it: the board, instead of being 24x24, is 15x24, so basically room for just one of each normally paired piece.  Each player gets 49 stones which they can place anywhere in the first six ranks, lengthwise, on their side of the board, subject to the constraint that if you don't make at least one ring/king, you obviously lose on move 0.  Both players do this simultaneously, with a divider between them. You could play full-width with 75 stones instead, but the setup takes forever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205802/#Comment_205802" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T17:10:25+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  5:10PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, I've suddenly realized.
