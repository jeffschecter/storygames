Here are my thoughts.<br/><br/>It took me a little while to figure out how to use each section.<br/><br/><b>STAGE 1</b><br/><br/>In Stage 1, I didn't realise until my third read that the spaceships are the track that the counter goes on. And I *only* realised this because in Stage 2 it was very clear that the line of red dots along the top were a track. You might want to put a white circle around each spaceship image (or do something else to make it easier to interpret as a track)<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the Earth Launch Window is in the right place. I assume you want this to be the first bit of description we give before we launch. If so, you might need to move it or refer to it in the numbered list ... It might even be that you start with all the pawns on Earth, do the Launch Window, and then move all the pawns to the flight deck<br/><br/>Also in Stage 1:<br/>- I'm not sure what the 'Qualify' protocol does or refers to<br/><br/>- The Shuttle could have an event in it, too: maybe 'Your weakness' or 'Your fear'<br/><br/>- Step 5 is a little unclear - do I have this right: everyone can move their pawns to any area they want; there can be more than one pawn in an area; the event in only one area is triggered in a turn<br/><br/><br/><b>STAGE 2</b><br/><br/>I find the procedure for Stage 2 quite confusing. I assume each red dot (is it supposed to be Mars or the Sun?) represents one month. So I assume we start with the counter on the dot furthest to the left.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where the pawns go, to start with. I assume they're all off the gameboard and are placed during Stage 2. That's a different procedure to Stage 1, and I don't think it needs to be.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the Return Shuttle represents. From its placement, it looks like once you hit the right-most red dot on the track, the shuttle might launch.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the lightening bolt symbol represents. Is it the number of times you took that particular skill tag in Stage 1? ... Oh! Wait. I see now: it's a resource that's generated by the solar array that you can then spend on other actions. It's not clear to me whether the solar array keeps generating energy every month once it's been activated, or whether you have to choose it again and again in order to get the energy.<br/><br/>OK, so the big question then (in terms of procedures) is 'What does "Deploy a module" look like in the game?' Is it a group conversation about which module to activate? Again, this is a slightly different procedure to Step 5 in Stage 1. After thinking about it carefully, my assumption is that the same rules as Stage 1 apply here. Everyone moves their pawn to a different area and then the group chooses which one takes effect.<br/><br/>Ah! And that's pretty cunning. The first time you go into a module, you can either deploy and describe it or you can trigger its effect. Neat (and it's starting to make me think that the solar array automatically produces an energy token every month after you've activated it).<br/><br/>Does the Scarcity protocol happen instead of anything else? Like, on a month with a Scarcity, you can't make any other choices?<br/><br/><br/><b>STAGE 3</b><br/><br/>I'm not sure when to trigger Stage 3 or how long it lasts for. Ideally, I guess you place the Stage 3 map next to the Stage 2 map and you just keep playing, moving your pawns and generating the fiction that comes out of it.<br/><br/>I'm assuming that because there's no track to move the counter along.<br/><br/>Retroactively, I guess that means that once you reach the end of the Stage 2 track, you introduce Stage 3. If so, you might want to put in a note at the end of the track to that effect.<br/><br/>Also in Stage 3:<br/>- check the spellings of 'derelict' and 'message from Earth'<br/><br/>- you could consider dropping the question marks from the injury tags. And in the ice drill, you might want to swap 'debate or argument' with the result for 4-5.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>Hope that helps! Good luck with the contest!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406425/#Comment_406425" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T20:02:04+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  8:02PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks steve! this really helps me out. I'll respond a bit here...<br/><br/>-yr right about the earth launch window, I considered putting everyone on earth with the protocol written right there, I think that would be a solid choice. I have to choose between that and making the earth pretty. same issue with the circles around the shuttle. <br/><br/>-everyone can move and everyone executes a protocol, even if it is 4 people all doing the same thing. I think it is cool to leave it up to the table about how we go about that, maybe two people describe something together? maybe the order of moves and protocols get jumbled and thats cool. I need to play this more.<br/><br/>-the solar array generates 1/energy each month all by itself, after it has been deployed, I need to make that more obvious.<br/><br/>-all of the protocol (deploying included) are by default performed by one character. In our game, whenever two people were in the same place we naturally included the other person in our descriptions.  I could even see some back and forth happening. <br/><br/>-Scarcity is like a bonus move the commander makes. everyone still gets their regular moves<br/><br/>-my intention with stage 3 was that you trigger it with the rover, explore a location, then return to the base. I could see there being fictional cause for a longer expedition. Maybe someone stays in the field lab for example. I don't see anything wrong with that. <br/><br/>thanks!<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406436/#Comment_406436" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-17T02:11:59+00:00" title="February 17, 2013  2:11AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ross looks like your links are not working, would like read and try out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406453/#Comment_406453" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-17T11:23:14+00:00" title="February 17, 2013 11:23AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            poo, my server went down while I was sleeping, I'll fix it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406454/#Comment_406454" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-17T12:04:36+00:00" title="February 17, 2013 12:04PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ok it is back <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406502/#Comment_406502" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T07:06:48+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  7:06AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is super interesting.

You are mixing colors and symbols in ways that don't readily map in my mind. It took me a while to realize the stage 1 protocol symbols are not used anywhere, but the color matters on the maps. Then in stage 2 there's a lightning bolt symbol that isn't described anywhere. I guess it is power, a new type of protocol? And then again in stage 3, a new symbol, new color that is <i>also </i>yellow, man you need to step back and think hard about information design.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406514/#Comment_406514" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T10:16:29+00:00" title="February 18, 2013 10:16AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this is really cool, but still a little too confusing.

How I think it is played, what I got and what I don\u2019t get.<br/><br/>First the theme \u2013 We the players are the crew of a mission to Mars. We each have a job to do. Shit will happen but there is no built in conflict between the crew (which there wouldn\u2019t be on a deep space mission).<br/><br/>Turns \u2013 The game is played in turns of one month each (at least in the trip out) I assume that the one month a turn scale continues on the planet so this is a game that jumps from critical scene to critical scene.<br/><br/>Protocol = Scene \u2013 I\u2019m guessing that a protocol is a scene. The tokens move around in the ship to do different scenes. It isn\u2019t clear if each person gets a scene each month or if only one player gets a scene per month. If it is multiple scenes per month there will the a LOT of scenes before they get to the planet. That could get a little boring. There is nothing to tell me what players do in scenes. I would run it like scenes in Fiasco, including players to interact with to talk about the theme of the protocol, but there is nothing in the game that tells me that and there are not clear end points to scenes. Without a guiding principle from my character (which could come from the tags) it might feel like I\u2019m punching into space \u2013 kind of floating and not mattering.<br/><br/>= Quality \u2013 doesn\u2019t get used in stage one so I had to look back at it in stage two. A bit confusing, looks like there is an energy token economy so you can\u2019t do everything at once.<br/><br/>Stage 2 \u2013 Looks like protocols are still scenes and are done one a month (still not clear if everyone gets one per month). The players are starting things up, collecting energy, and facing scarcity. The dots across the top \u2013 are they month markers? I the mission time limited? I\u2019m not certain. It looks like the engineer is called on to produce energy. If they have to mechanically do that more than turning on the solar panel it would not be a fun role to play. It is unclear to my e why anyone would want to make anything bad happen. The commander has to pick a scarcity but no one else has to make bad things happen.  Once everything is turned on does stage 2 end? I\u2019m not sure.<br/><br/>Stage 3 Exploration \u2013 So in this one people are rolling dice to tell them the theme of the scene they play. They expend energy and the roll is effected by character\u2019s present and tags gained in past scenes. I don\u2019t know why people would want any negative tags. It looks like players can keep on exploring as long as they like. I see that stage three is done each time the rover is sent out so this can be an interlude between housekeeping scenes. <br/><br/>I\u2019m not clear on when players end the game. I assume it is when the resourced dwindle and their characters are worn out with tags. I\u2019m guessing that the last scene is about the survivors getting in the return ship and blasting off. <br/><br/>This is what I got from the read through. I\u2019ve not played too many story games so this is what an inexperienced gamer might take away from it. Visually it is very clean and attractive. I think it would look pretty to play. I think I would be attracted to play it. If another gamer was playing who answered my questions I think it would be a fun game. My only major concern is where the conflict comes from. <br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/><br/>PS: I wrote my own impressions before reading the other comments (intentionally). Now that I've read the comments I see that I didn't pick up on the space ships as month markers in stage 1. I see that the dots (which I didn't read as suns or months) do limit the length of the game. People need to work fast to find life on Mars. I still don't see where the conflict is between the players. Since there is no game master (I assume) the conflict is all up to the players if the system doesn't build it in. <br/><br/>I still think it looks cool and I'm certain I would play it in a Games on Demand kind of setting - maybe I'll get the chance to do so at Origins?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406622/#Comment_406622" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-19T11:08:54+00:00" title="February 19, 2013 11:08AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks chris, for your thoughtful feedback.
