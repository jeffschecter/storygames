Damn, 4E is hot.  I also picked up the two preview books...despite some folks commenting that they didn't want to spend money on promo material, I found it completely worth it.  Armed with the philosophy behind the design decisions for 4E I was totally prepared to understand KotS on its own merits.  It probably would have been in WotC's best interest to have given the material away...so that more people would be on the same page as them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of key items from the promo material is that their vision was to ramp up the fantastic.  I'm a purist myself...I like elves and dwarves and hobbit-esque halflings on the shire...but knowing the whys and the wherefors behind the decision to ramp up the fantasy (with floating cities and rivers of moving earth and such) makes it easier for me to adjust to having Tieflings and Dragonborn characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe new feat/powerz system is gold.  Characters are essentially designed like a collectable card deck and the powers are kept short sweet and standardized just like the text on cards.  The brief look in KotS left me greatly anticpating the options in the PHB.  Having monsters designed in the same card power style with a tactical guide in the book is fabulous.  In many ways they read like the scripting in a solo RTS campaign...when you cross this point these enemies will activate and attack...and it could play that way if the DM adhered to the text too slavishly.  But what I liked was the text working in conjunction with reading the powerz in the stat block...I really got an immediate feel for how to play the monsters smartly and appropriately...and I could immediately see room for situation appropriate tweaks...like using perception checks with the DC class set by distance to see whether nearby monsters hear the fight next door.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scenario itself does a great job of being an intro to the game.  I've read lots of folks suggesting that the scenario is a poor introduction because it doesn't provide enough "role-playing".  To which I've gotta think...duh.  4E didn't revolutionize D&amp;D; roleplaying...it revolutionized D&amp;D; combat mechanics...so the first scenario should emphasize D&amp;D; combat mechanics.  In fact, KotS's biggest weakness as a scenario in my mind are the things that make it that much better as an intro/promo scenario.  There's an unecessary variety of monsters and fight locations packed into what is essentially a pretty straight forward adventure.  There didn't need to be kobolds AND goblins AND hobgoblins AND a few humans thrown in...AND zombies...AND skeletons...AND the really disgusting corrupted corpses...AND...why not...lets throw in some completely gratuitous vampires and a shadow dude too.  Similarly in an effort to showcase how easy it is to make really exciting environments to fight in, the scenario went a little overboard.  Much like one could watch a court room drama and conclude...there's no way a DA would see that many crazy cases in a lifetime, let alone a season...the shear variety of fight locations does get a little much...but I expect it pales in comparison to what will be coming at Paragon and Epic level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could see playing this game with virtually no DM prep needed.  Back when I was D&amp;Ding; several times a week (AD&amp;D1E;), even running a published module required lots of prep.  That makes it a game I'm willing to try running...even though I haven't DMed D&amp;D; in 15+ years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1 question for those already running the scenario...the quick start rules seem to have left out the rules for powers that Recharge.  From context I'm assuming that these are powers that are Encounter Powers that maybe useable more than once per encounter if some "recharge" parameters are met...but what those parameters are is unclear.  Best guess is that as part of the Start of Turn actions you roll a d6 and if the Recharge number comes up the power is active again...but that's just a guess.  Anyone know for sure?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147135/#Comment_147135" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T15:26:07+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  3:26PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your interpretation of recharge is correct.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147155/#Comment_147155" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T17:18:38+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  5:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am 95% in agreement with Ralph.

In a more extreme case, could you run a humans-only campaign?  No monsters, no elves and stuff?  I get the feeling that it is rigidly organized to operate as a unit, and that this sort of tinkering will break things.

The DMG covers the topic and discusses what to do or the dangers of having missing roles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is definitely rigid in some ways (I wouldn't mix characters of different levels) but many of the powers overlap in that they do variations of the same things with minor tweaks (which in long term play becomes a bit of a drag).

We played last week and though i had fun, I was quickly losing interest in the complete tactical nature of the game. The requirements for a map I found frustrating, and I have no love for minies (certainly army men, pennies and the lego guys from the other post will suffice for minis). I was very hesitant when I noted that the powers' ratings are given in squares. <br>\n<br/>\nAfter one encounter, we got a sense of what the characters were for and what they could do. As we got farther in on the game we found ourselves (or at least I did) limited by the rules (we performed attacks and actions), if there was no obvious rule for it we found that it was difficult for us to figure out how to do it since it seemed like a board game. and it felt like it as discouraged to step beyond the strictures of the character's powers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely did not feel like I was roleplaying (a charge that is often thrown at D&amp;D), but i felt even more separated from my PC than normal. My character was a collection of powers that could only work when we had a map in front of us. <br/>\n<br/>\ngranted we were playing a demo game, but rather than making me interested in seeing where they took some of the things that I liked, i was left with no interest in any additional play. it felt like they were reviving the war game roots of D&amp;D, but those are roots that I was happy to leave behind. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________<br/>\nJason                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147306/#Comment_147306" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T11:40:52+00:00" title="June  2, 2008 11:40AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran one of the 4e games at GPNW.

I created my own encounters, but used the pregen PCs from Shadowfell (which are actually really cool).<br/><br/>We learned the system and had two big fights in about 3.5 hours, with 7 PCs -- including a fight with a Dragon who was pretty serious business. It was more of a demo than a real session, but even so, everyone had a blast. I was amazed at how easy it was to run on the fly with just eye-balled challenges ("4 minions is worth one guy... so I'll throw down 12 plus the Dragon and see how it goes").<br/><br/>The helping system, stunt table (DMG p.42!), cool powerz, and way easy combat system added up to a really nice mix.

In D&amp;D 3.5, as a fight it felt like any time I did anything other than attack the monster for as much damage as possible I was letting my team down.

If you don't have the stats for any specialist or demi-human, you're a fighter my son.<br/><br/>Which, in practice, sort of works out anyway. My experience was that the the players of specialists and demi-humans were constantly looking for a set-up to use their cool powers, which meant that the fighters got to do everything else. Also, since they had no cool powers to speak of, playing them meant doing the old "succeed by avoiding the mechanics" method of getting things done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147515/#Comment_147515" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T02:29:50+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  2:29AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>The game is definitely rigid in some ways (I wouldn't mix characters of different levels)</blockquote>\nDoes this mean that everyone levels up at the same time? Do you just split the XPs evenly, or all get the same amount, or is there something a little more involved?Yeah, experience is split up between those who helped talke out the encounter. So if everybody is there all the time (and actually do something instead of standing around somewhere) you all level up at the same time. (ie. roughly every ten encounters.)<br/><br/>Now, I'd imagine lack of participation could make a difference here, but that would depend on how the group handles it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
