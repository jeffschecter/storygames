We played:<br/><br/>1. A kick-ass game of <b>Mist-Robed Gate</b> set in a cyberpunk future San Juans full of retired cybernetic assassins, crazy server-worshiping cultists, and organ smugglers. I played an undercover cop infiltrating the cults. Only 3 of 7 PCs were left alive.<br/><br/>2. The first-ever session of Jason Morningstar's new freeform chamber larp <b>Maroons</b>, which is like Apollo 13 meets Deliverance + Dogs in the Vineyard. First session ever and this game feels really close to being done already. Super super awesome. Am already thinking about running it again at GameStorm in 2 weeks. All 7 PCs survived this one, but it was touch-and-go. Nearly a TPK instead.<br/><br/>3. A fun and surprisingly violence-free session of the <b>Planarch Codex</b>, where the PCs -- having just come back from stealing a diabolist's contract from the local Embassy of Hell -- subcontracted a job from another freebooter crew, trying to return a giant severed-head-in-a-bag to a wizard patron who had gone missing and stiffed the other crew on payment for said head. They ended up storming the wizard's tower by leaping across from the top floor of the neighboring tower, which was owned by time-travelling wizards from the future who knew their descendants.

The plan was to have no children until the ship was within a few years of planetfall but our original survey data turned out to be crap and now we're not sure where or when we're going to land.<br/><br/>Faced with this bad news, people don't want to wait. If they're not sure how long it's going to be they want to start having children now. That's our new Crossroad: will we allow people to have children now.<br/><br/>Things heat up immediately when we find out some couples have been skipping their contraceptives and have already conceived. Oh well, it's just a few people, right? We can support a few more mouths. In the middle of an argument I Predict (hand in the air) that if we don't allow everyone to have children (crossroad = no), people will not stand for <i>anyone</i> being allowed to have kids. No would-be-parents want to watch someone else raising a child when they can't. It just wouldn't be fair.<br/><br/>The captain's player (who isn't even in the scene) looks at me in discomfort.

Sophronia, the 9 inch tall clockwork faerie, used her illusions to deal real damage to everyone in the same zone. Naturally, this included Victor, who had to take the Consequence: I Hate My Friends! (He has one fewer Consequence than everyone else because the player refused to get rid of a Consequence reflecting his love for his fiance.)<br/><br/>Later on, the shape-shifting Reginald moved in on the Ghul Mummies as Sophronia continued to attack with scarab beetles, lightning, asps, whatever.<br/><br/>Victor: So now _you_ get to take your lover's attacks.<br/><br/>Reginald: This I'm used to.<br/><br/>Indeed, he requested she try scorpions, finding them rather, ah, stimulating. This caused a raised eyebrow from Lady Alice.<br/><br/>Alice (while telekinetically maintaining protective force fields or hurling ghul mummies around): I would prefer the two of you to have your fights out of the public eye.<br/><br/>Afterwards, Victor had some words for Sophronia about hitting him with her asps.<br/><br/>Sophronia: But they were only my illusion, Victor! It was obvious.<br/><br/>"It's Obvious!" is one of Victor's Aspects. We noted that if one got Fate Points for working the names of one's Aspects into dialogue, even without invoking or compelling them, the PCs would be swimming in Fate Points.<br/><br/>Mind, Victor tended to keep "noxious substances" in his pockets, like, oh, cold iron, even when inviting Sophronia to travel in another of his pockets.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Oh that _did_ happen! Well, now we're even. So, what are we going to do about those mummies?<br/><br/>Why, follow them to the hidden temple,  where Reginald turned into a Giant Snake. We agreed that the temporary aspect he had simply had to be Giant Motherfucking Snake In My Motherfucking Temple!<br/><br/>Reginald pondered whether he could now hypnotize Victor, being a giant snake.<br/><br/>Me: Why would you want to hypnotize Victor?<br/><br/>Reginald: When he becomes a power hungry meglomaniacal --<br/><br/>Me: How could you tell the difference?<br/><br/>Alice: He becomes slightly less annoying.<br/><br/>Reginald: He stops saying "should" and starts saying "shall"!<br/><br/>Sophronia: Alice, can we put some kind of lock on Victor's mind?<br/><br/>Victor: How about we put a lock on the door instead?<br/><br/>Reginald blocked the very wide door and the corridor leading up to it against the approaching ghul mummies, he spotted Sophronia's cat, Martin, and got an idea:<br/><br/>Reginald: I'm sure that if you rubbed Martin against my scales you could build up a lovely static charge!<br/><br/>Sophronia: We'll call that Plan B.<br/><br/>Eventually, they dealt with the problem, although there were some unfortunate consequences.<br/><br/>Alice: I'm never going to get the stain out of these gloves.<br/><br/>Victor: All right. First order of business: I need to get a new coat!<br/><br/>Reginald: I don't think you'll find one in the middle of the desert.<br/><br/>Later...<br/><br/>Victor: All right, I admit having a bunch of power hungry maniacs coming after me for my heart because they think it will resurrect a dead dark queen who will reward them would be mildly inconvenient, but other than that I don't see the problem.<br/><br/>Reginald: Really Victor, we scheduled Thursdays for that sort of thing. I really don't want to take another day out of my schedule for that.<br/><br/>And that left a discussion about bathing.<br/><br/>Sophronia (who is made of brass): Bathing sounds terribly wet.<br/><br/>Victor was confused, as, after all, Sophronia did bathe, sort of.<br/><br/>Sophronia: No, I oil myself. It's not the same thing at all.<br/><br/>Victor: If you pick up oil, it's wet.<br/><br/>Alice: No, it's oily.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Two pieces of metal in oil rub against each other smoothly. Two pieces of metal in water don't. Trust me on this. And metal covered in oil doesn't rust.<br/><br/>Victor: We are disccusing oil.<br/><br/>Alice: And water and slipperyness.<br/><br/>Sophronia (deciding it's high time to change the subject): So. We were going to fly an island!

On entering the fortress, Lark hears the whispering voices of the elf-ghosts who guard the fortress. He attempts to Parley with them, asking humbly if he and his friends can stay the night. Partial success: the ancestors demand sacrifice. They tell Lark that the PCs can stay the night in the fortress but each must give up something of value to him on the altar at the center of the fortress. Lark watches as Thorin cuts off his ponytail (he had "weird" or "crazy" hair as part of his look and had described himself as bald, but with a ponytail in back) and leaves it on the altar. Then Hawke removes his "Champion" amulet from the Fighter's Guild and places it next to Thorin's queue. Lark's player declares that the only thing he has that he values is his father's sword, and there is no way he is giving that up. Thorin tries to reason with him, but Lark is peeved that the elves (who may or may not be his ancestors) want him to sacrifice, when he already humbled himself before them (typical emo half-elf behavior). Lark flees into the night, and the first thing he hears on leaving the fortress is the howling of wargs in the distance. We end the session there for the night, and Thorin takes a new bond: "Lark is a troubled soul; I will help him see What Lies Beneath."<br/><br/>Also, we were playing in the student lounge at a mysterious Institute where we are all studying depth psychology and fairy tales and alchemy and stuff. There were other students coming in and out and watching our game and everyone thought it was pretty awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409316/#Comment_409316" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T02:05:44+00:00" title="March 17, 2013  2:05AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2013 2:06AM by Matthijs.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Okkupasjon!, an Archipelago playset (first playtest)</b><br/><br/>Sgt.

Things spiraled from there with the gypsy having his deal with 'My Lover' dismissed to save the life of the Jack so he could give the love of his betrothed as tithe to the Fae. The nephew being saved from the burning pyre and almost reborn from it and the wisewoman surviving the Winter as per her deal with the spirit, but dying on the first day of Spring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409320/#Comment_409320" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T05:02:28+00:00" title="March 17, 2013  5:02AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs in the Vineyard at Indiemeetup in London.

The only shot fired in the game was by the Steward in error as the gun was wrestled for and the shot hit both his daughter and a Dog. The daughter was saved, the Dog died. As two of the remaining Dogs go to confront the midwife the Steward is told 'you will never clean this blood stain on your boards, it will remind you every day that a good man died because of your pride.'

What's everyone else doing?<br/><br/>Sophronia: I am going to polish my hair.<br/><br/>Reginald went with Victor to make sure the suit buying went well. Alice did some research. Then, her player, Josh, asked if 1840 Manhattan had a muliple-mail-deliveries-per-day at this time. (We know that James Joyce's Dublin did, that being a very important part in his courtship of Nora. But, I digress.)<br/><br/>GM: You can just telepath it -- who cares?<br/><br/>Kristen (who plays Sophronia): But <i>letters</i>!<br/><br/>Josh: Kristen gets it.<br/><br/>GM: If nothing else, you can send urchins.<br/><br/>Someone: Urchinmail! <br/><br/>Alice's summation of the evening's plot: So you are saying that we are left with the horrible choice of either allowing the New Martians to invade or damaging art?<br/><br/><br/>Sophronia: Alice, how do you say "princess" in Martian?<br/><br/>Reginald (who speaks Martian): It's a combination of the words "ruler", "beauty", and "danger".<br/><br/>Alice: Danger is only in there as a side effect! It's a corruption!<br/><br/>Reginald: Yes, it's a suffix. But, nevertheless, it is there. <br/><br/><br/>One happy side effect of the evening's activities was that our heroes, who had promised to bring the sidhe three items from Mars, now had one. Sophronia was appalled by the idea of giving that particular item to the sidhe.<br/><br/>Victor: You want to give them harmless boring things?<br/><br/>Sophronia: Yes! Yes! That is correct! Funny that you should notice that! What is <i>wrong</i> with you people?<br/><br/>It is really disturbing when the 9-inch brass clockwork faerie is the voice of reason.

Musca issues a challenge to Suhail, hoping to lure the Dragon into combat as well.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410755/#Comment_410755" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-29T12:01:35+00:00" title="March 29, 2013 12:01PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Kerberos group made preparations to return to London on their flying island. They wondered how the clockwork fairy's (Sophronia's) father / creator was getting on, what with three mad scientists, including himself, working together.<br/><br/>Someone: Are you sure there will still be a house?<br/><br/>Sophronia: Of course there will! They've had plenty of time to rebuild it if they destroyed it.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Victor pushed Reginald to come clean about Reginald's impersonation of his master, Lord Gregory Sage of the Pennsington family. (Both Reginald and Gregory are shapeshifters.)<br/><br/>Sophronia: Victor, do you have long heart to heart talks with _your_ family?<br/><br/>Victor: No.<br/><br/>And no wonder, given all the villains in Victor's family!<br/><br/>Reginald: May I point out that none of you know the first thing about the Pennsingtons.<br/><br/>Alice: We've been there.<br/><br/>Sophronia: We know you.<br/><br/>Alice: We may not know the fourth thing about the Pennsingtons. But, we know the first.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Yes, like where it is. I can point to it on a map.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the group had a couple of prisoners to question.<br/><br/>GM: So, if you want to take over his mind and adjust it...<br/><br/>Alice: Oh please, that's boring. Also. unethical.<br/><br/>Reginald: Also, my job.<br/><br/>Alice: Yes, still unethical.<br/><br/>Reginald: No need to be redundant.<br/><br/>The group returned to England, landing their island in a lake on the Pennsington's land. Victor horrified Alice with his plans to replace his beloved coat.<br/><br/>Alice: You're going to buy it off a rack?!<br/><br/>Sophronia (the 9-inch clockwork fairy): It must be nice to buy things off a rack.<br/><br/>And, Reginald came clean to Lady Sage, fully cognizant that his friends were eavesdropping.<br/><br/>Reginald: The first thing you need to know is that if you decide to execute me, there will be witnesses. However, they won't all be sympathetic witnesses, so that won't do me any good.<br/><br/>I had thought about what the worst thing that I could throw at Reginald while Being a Fan of the PCs, and came up with the obvious. As the real Gregory Sage has no interest in returning from Africa, while Reginald has been running around doing his best to be the Pennsington Heir,  he has now been made the Pennsington Heir in fact, as well as in impersonation. So, he's stuck with a double life and all the complications of, well, being a PC. Sophronia, his fiance, has resigned herself to this.<br/><br/>Sophronia: I suppose I will have to take him as he is. (Take Me As I Am is one of her aspects.)<br/><br/>And, as the group left Pennsington Manor, the Sages commissioned a carpenter to add a series of very small rooms for the bride-to-be of the Pennsington Heir.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/huckabees" title="huckabees"><img alt="huckabees" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/huckabees">huckabees</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410756/#Comment_410756" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-29T12:34:39+00:00" title="March 29, 2013 12:34PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Monsterhearts campaign is in the middle of our second season (episode 5 of 10).<br/><br/>Our Vampire was just anointed head of The Black Court when his maker The Highest succumbed to a mysterious illness related to the darkness in the woods.<br/><br/>One of our twin Witches and the Angel went to visit the Angel's father, a Presbyterian minister who was shot by a mysterious FBI agent, only to run into two more agents waiting to "question" the Angel.

Mad Willie Byrne, my insane ancient coal miner has tackled and hogtied Harry, a state employee from Harrisburg in charge of evacuating Centralia.  Tied and gagged, he watches as Willie lays out the ritual elements: candles, a live rooster, a machete, etc.  He looks over at June, who had initially come as an anthropologist to study the cult but later joined.  Harry is looking for any help he can find, pleading with his eyes to be set free.  June looks over apologetically.

The brainer stalks two rival scuba diving scavengers (Big Shark &amp; Medium Shark) who are also lovers planning to puppet string one of them in the darkness so s/he can steal their suits later. The brainer lost the air tank on an earlier expedition and the rival divers are almost getting away. Trying to catch up quickly the brainer is caught in their flashlight and a brawl ensues. The brainer siezed the air tube from one of them and takes a breath before knocking her out with an elbow. When the other one is closing in s/he tries to take the lifeless body hostage with a scalpel but is too slow and gets knifed in the side losing the grip of the hostage. The brainer places violation glove on the divers forehead.<br/><br/>"Am I allowed to give an impossible command for my puppet strings?"<br/><br/>"Yeah sure."<br/><br/>"I order her to fly!"<br/><br/>"Well, that's not good, if she tries her best that counts as doing your bidding. Try something that even attempting is impossible."<br/><br/>"Love me (rolls 10+). I explode her brains."<br/><br/>"There is no effect."<br/><br/>I asked how the community reacted to the death of Medium Shark and this new relationship. The brainer chose to never take off the diving mask in public and take on Medium Sharks identity.

They get a case in Jerusalem involving the murder of a young worker at a dig site just outside of the city. Mysterious chicken tracks lead away from the scene. They eventually discover a buried chamber devoted to the worship of Ishtar, the Assyrian goddess of love and war. She seems to be returning to the land of the living and uses her influence to break war out between the Israeli government and the Palestinians to the point of bloody rioting in the streets.<br/><br/>That's when the multi-colored chicks and bunnies show up. These are the rabid minions of Ishtar and their bite fills you with love for Ishtar and paranoia towards everyone around you. The battle culminates in the Dome of the Rock where a fissure opens between our world and that of the old gods. Ishtar emerges and only a confession of true love between two mortals will send her back.<br/><br/>Our Luchador had set up a secret crush on The Professional during Character Creation saw his opportunity, confessed his love and Ishtar was defeated.
