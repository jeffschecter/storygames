I recently started GMing again for the first time in about 10 years. I don't have a whole lot of past GMing experience, either, so I consider myself more or less a newb at this. As such, I'm looking for some more experienced opinions regarding a situation I'm currently facing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Situation:</b><br/>\nI'm running a Star Wars d6 campaign set during the <i>KoTOR</i> era. The current adventure revolves around a slave auction being held on a spice-mining planet. (I got the idea from one of my players, who suggested "freeing some enslaved Wookiees" as an adventure that he would enjoy.) The party has been sent there on a mission to disrupt the auction and free some or all of the slaves, if possible.<br/>\n<b><br/>\nThe Resources:</b><br/>\n1) The party has a tramp freighter captain waiting to transport them (and anyone they're able to free) off the planet. 2) The party's tech expert has sabotaged two protocol droids, reprogramming them to start a riot among the bidders at the auction when she gives them a codeword verbally. 3) She also modified another PC's comlink so that it will jam the frequency of the slaves' remote-control shock collars, so they can get away safely. 4) The party tank beat up two of the men guarding the slaves while they were off-duty, and left them for dead in an alleyway, so there should now be 1/3 fewer armed guards to overpower. 5) The tech expert is a native of the planet, so she was able to get a lead on three mercenaries opposed to slavery who might be willing to assist them.<br/>\n<b><br/>\nThe GMing Style:</b><br/>\nI'm consciously moving away from a "Story Before" style to a "Story Now" style, if that helps you understand what kind of advice would be most helpful to me. (I'm assuming that those terms are relatively well-known on this forum; correct me if I'm wrong in that assumption! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Question:</b><br/>\nWhen and how much do you think a GM should try to improve upon his or her players' plans for accomplishing a mission?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, my group's current plan seems to be: "Trigger the sabotaged protocol droids and wait for them to cause a riot; activate the frequency jammer to neutralize the threat of the shock collars; have the Wookiee in the party yell to the Wookiee slaves (about 1/2 the slaves at the auction are Wookiees) to follow the party; lead them out of the building; run down back-streets and alleyways to try and escape anyone who gives chase; then, when the coast is clear, sneak to the spaceport to make a getaway in the freighter."<br/>\n<br/>\nSome ideas I have for how they could improve on this plan are 1) sabotaging the lighting system at the auction house to give them cover of darkness at the moment they start freeing the slaves, 2) stealing the slavers' repulsorlift skiff to use as a getaway vehicle instead of fleeing on foot, and 3) getting some "inside help" from some of the slavers' employees.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could easily introduce ideas <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> by way of NPCs ("We're not willing to take on a bunch of armed guards for so little money, but we'd be willing to give you a little tactical advice for free, since it's for a good cause..."), and of course I could just make <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> happen ("Those mercenaries that they hired to make up for the two guards who 'went missing'? You suddenly realize that it's those 3 abolitionist mercs you talked to earlier...").<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I feel like I might be stealing the spotlight from the players if I try to improve upon their plans (which, IMHO, have already been quite creative), and that it would be more rewarding for them if I let them run with the plan they came up with themselves, whether they succeed or fail. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n(I'd fall back on thinking about how I'd feel if I were in their shoes, except I don't have much playing experience, either, [and what little I have is almost a decade old,] so it's hard for me to picture things from their perspective. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374822/#Comment_374822" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-28T01:58:13+00:00" title="April 28, 2012  1:58AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd settle for taking what the players have come up with and making it as interesting as possible: let the plan commence, then add unforeseen obstacles and opportunities as seems fit. It might be fun to take a page out of the <i>Leverage</i> playbook here and let each player hace one opporunity to narrate a flashback which enables them to overcome or mitigate a problem encountered in the present.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the protocol droids go berserk, but there happens to be a tech expert in the crowd who tries to shut them down and repair them; one of the PCs could have a flashback to the night before where they got the tech guy drunk and also sabotaged his kit. Cut back to the present and the tech dude's interference just makes things worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this way, the players could incorporate any additional ideas, such as a blackout or getting inside help, or anything else that occurs to them once they are committed and can't back out easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374823/#Comment_374823" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-28T02:24:56+00:00" title="April 28, 2012  2:24AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were playing a character in this game, I would prefer that the GM didn't try to play the game for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374824/#Comment_374824" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-28T02:29:56+00:00" title="April 28, 2012  2:29AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anduwaithe</cite>However, I feel like I might be stealing the spotlight from the players if I try to improve upon their plans (which, IMHO, have already been quite creative), and that it would be more rewarding for them if I let them run with the plan they came up with themselves, whether they succeed or fail.

Are we sitting here seeing how good a plan the players can come up with? Why are we doing the planning now anyway, instead of just doing the action itself? Is the point about figuring out some true-to-life detail about how our competent heroes would go about doing something like this, or is it about finding out whether our heroes are competent to begin with? These types of questions, when answered, would tell me what to do. Perhaps the players enjoy the idea that the fates of their characters depend on how clever they are in the planning?<br><br>Most adventure games that I play in Story Now style (which term means narrativism, basically, to clarify) would subsume the planning into some conflict resolution procedure, which would enable us to basically first find out how well the characters do, and then decide along the process whether their success or failure is due to their good or bad planning or unexpected circumstances or enemy cleverness or whatever. Basically, describing details like "and then we steal the slaver skiff" would not be a matter of whether it's a good idea to try to do it, but rather a matter of colouring in the concrete details of what happens in the process of freeing slaves. This would free us from having to pre-generate a genuinely good plan before we could try to do the deed, which means that the choice to do the deed would be more about trusting in your character's strengths than about trusting in your own cleverness vs. the GM's planned resistance. The planning the characters do in advance would come up only superficially ("And then we spend the rest of the day figuring out the details.") and in practical actions of actually playing out the heist ("Ha haa, my planning clearly predicted this eventuality, and here's how I prepared for this setback.").<br><br>For example, I might GM this type of situation (depending on the specific game and not just on the Story Now angle) by asking the players to decide whether they're going to try to free the slaves (and whether they're going to accept the help of a player character's rival, and whatever else thematically interesting detail there might be), after which I'd cut directly into the action, describing how their characters are approaching the operative zone. Then we'd roll dice or whatever it is that you do in the game in question to find out how well the characters do, and then we'd describe how the characters free the slaves. We assume that the characters actually did plan what they're doing, but we the players don't describe these things twice, first in theory and then in action: the first time we see that the slaver skiff will be hijacked is when the characters actually try to do it, not when the players speculate about it in advance. You'll note that this is like movie storytelling works most of the time.<br><br>Overall, if I take the Story Now declaration by face value, I would join in on the planning in nine games out of ten - most narrativist games I've played have not treated heist planning as an important player challenge, it's all just about enjoying the details of the fictional world. Also, I would tell the players to not worry overmuch about the tactical nuances, and to trust that the characters who are specced up as tactical geniuses will have smart plans, while the stoopid ones will cause amusing complications, all without the players having to plug in the holes in any material way. There's essentially nothing at stake in the plan the players might create, at least not tactically, and therefore there's no reason why the GM couldn't join in the brainstorming just as well as anybody else.<br><br>In fact, looking at the details of your project, were I the GM and serious about the Story Now, I'd look for opportunities to integrate moral conundrums into the planning phase. For example, offer the heroes extra resources from a questionable source, so the players get to decide whether freeing the slaves is important enough to justify accepting help from a Sith apprentice or whatever. As a Story Now GM you should be looking for opportunities to complicate the emerging story, at least in most games of the type.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374832/#Comment_374832" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-28T06:36:11+00:00" title="April 28, 2012  6:36AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are playing a game with a pretty clear division of authority, so I would let them do their jobs and come up with a plan without your help.

(And I was already pretty optimistic, based on what I'd seen on Story Games while I was lurking.) So thanks to all of you who replied! This forum rocks! :-D<br><br>Anyway, moving on to some specific points you raised:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I think your feelings are well-grounded, and you should pay attention to them.<br><br>They came up with a great plan, so you should absolutely resist the urge to tinker with it. They gave you gold, it would be rude to insist on gilding it yourself.</br></br></blockquote>\nYes, exactly. I already feel like I've done this way more than I should have (relative to the GMing style I'm trying to adopt), since I was the one who a) established the getaway freighter as part of the background to the mission, b) suggested to the tech expert's player that since this is her character's home planet, she might be able to draw on her local connections to find help for the mission, and c) told them that remote controls could be jammed (and then followed that up by pointing out that their comlinks could be re-purposed to do that with an appropriate skill check) when they were trying to think of a way to deal with the shock collars.<br><br/>(Regarding that last one, I also made a total blunder [as far as "shared gaming" is concerned, anyway] when one of the players asked me "Do the shock collars operate over a server, or by hand?", because he had the idea of trying to hack them if they operated over a server, and my reply was all "I think it would make more sense for them to operate via a direct transmission". D'oh! Oh well, at least I'm learning from my mistakes. :-D )<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Now, if you can think of good opportunities to place in their path that they may or may not take advantage of (stealing the skiff, for example), that seems kosher.

It's not Gamist versus Narrativist, it's just genre fidelity. GMing advice is all pretty solid on coming up with good complications and setbacks and providing opposition for the players, and all of that works just fine in a Star Wars game; GMing advice tends to run a bit thin on remembering to make victories feel rewarding, though, and dropping that ball can really put a damper on a Star Wars vibe. Star Wars villains should be particularly evil, the heroes should be outnumbered but not outmatched, and when the heroes win, it should feel big and rewarding and exciting, not matter-of-fact or negligible. (And yes, not particularly complicated, because Star Wars is not about complicated stories and ambiguity. A little bit of ambiguity as a palate-cleanser is fine, but the game's main diet should be swashbuckling, rollicking adventure.)<br/><br/>All IMO, of course, but it's an opinion formed by many many years of great Star Wars games.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374879/#Comment_374879" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-28T16:17:55+00:00" title="April 28, 2012  4:17PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's what I mean by making the world full of awesome stuff.

You suddenly realize that it's those 3 abolitionist mercs you talked to earlier...").<br/><br/>However, I feel like I might be stealing the spotlight from the players if I try to improve upon their plans (which, IMHO, have already been quite creative), and that it would be more rewarding for them if I let them run with the plan they came up with themselves, whether they succeed or fail. What do you think?</blockquote>\nWell, presumably the PCs all have eyes and ears, yeah? So if there's an obvious problem in any plan they come up with, you could just point it out to them directly, instead of having an NPC say it. Like, they will be able to see that the lights are always on, if they are always on, so obviously that would be detrimental to any sort of covert operation. So just say it: "So hey, you can see that the lights are always on, that might be a bit of a problem."<br/><br/>Did you draw a map of the place? Does it have all the vehicles drawn on it? You can just point out about how long it will take for them to walk from point A to point B, and when they want to go faster than that you can just say "Well, there are some vehicles just sitting over there. You can see them pretty easily, doesn't look like anybody is in them."<br/><br/>The thing is, though: Don't give them <b>plans</b>. Just tell them about <b>the setting</b>. Give them the lay of the land, tell them where obvious problems and obstacles are located, tell them what kinds of resources are around that they could possibly use if they were so inclined. Don't tell them how to do things or whatever, just tell the what is there. If they think it's a problem, they'll come up with a solution. If they think it's useful, they'll use it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374900/#Comment_374900" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-29T01:21:38+00:00" title="April 29, 2012  1:21AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will interfere if I think the players are misunderstanding something that their characters wouldn't, and I'll say something like, "Okay, you would know..."

I would definitely find a way to put this in sharp relief, like Eero says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>(Also, give the slaves names and desires of their own. They should never just be The Slaves.)</blockquote>\nThe PCs haven't met the slave characters yet (they've been held on-board a well-guarded ship so far), but they soon will, so I've started thinking about how I can flesh each of these NPCs out. Like I said, about half of them are going to be Wookiees, and I intended for them to be from Kashyyyk, since I thought it might be interesting if they later tried to convince the Wookiee PC (who was born on Tatooine) to go there with them. As for the rest, I was thinking that they'd be a mix of Humans, Twi'leks and Rodians from the Outer Rim and Hutt Space.<br/><br/>First of all, I face the question of whether they'll want to accept the PCs' offer to free them. Is it plausible that any of them would refuse the offer, assuming the guards who could shoot them for running away were dispatched?<br/><br/>Secondly, among those who do go with the PCs, how many would also take the PCs up on their offer to get them off the planet? Slavery is legal here, and since they're now escaped slaves, I would assume that most if not all of them would want to get away. Unless they're worried that the PCs are actually a rival group of slavers who are just trying to steal them away from the other group...<br/><br/>Third, among those that go with the PCs on the freighter, would they just wait to arrive on the planet (where slavery is outlawed) that the PCs intend to take them to? Or would some of them want to commandeer the freighter, and have it take them somewhere else?<br/><br/>I can come up with my own answers to these questions, but if any of you have some insight or ideas you'd like to share, I'd love to hear it. I was already interested in making the slaves individuals with unique and potentially conflicting agendas of their own, but with all the recent discussion on these forums about racist tropes and trivialization, I especially want to make sure that these NPCs aren't just slave stereotypes. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375863/#Comment_375863" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T09:13:19+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  9:13AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2012 1:38PM by thadrine.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate to say it, but I will often slip a player a note with "good ideas."

For example, regarding question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, I could also easily see someone with a cautious personality concluding that, "Going with this group of armed strangers who brazenly beat up / blasted my captors will probably get me killed in short order by the authorities. An opportunity to escape may not come along very often, but I know that I'm better off waiting for one that's better-planned than this."<br/><br/>Regarding the second question, like you said, I think there'd be well-founded concern among many of them as to what the PCs' intentions really are. Even if the PCs are able to come up with ways of allaying these fears for most, there will still be at least some who remain distrustful. Those that are averse to confronting the PCs would probably look for a convenient opportunity to slip away quietly during the escape and try to make it on their own. Those that think they could challenge the PCs might potentially go with them to the freighter, with the intention of commandeering it once they're in hyperspace.<br/><br/>I think that's actually one reason I'm not too concerned about coming up with complications and dilemmas to throw at my players during the "raid on the auction" portion of the adventure: successfully completing the raid will lead to some very interesting complications and dilemmas of its own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376105/#Comment_376105" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T05:07:10+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  5:07AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2012 5:07AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you could end up with a really juicy ethical dilemma - a ship full of ex-slaves who are fully capable of beating your ass and stealing your ship.

Or rush and modify your route through that dangerous area of space to prevent the other shipment of wookiees from ever reaching the transdoshian hunting preserve/trandoshian boyscout camp?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anduwaithe" title="Anduwaithe"><img alt="Anduwaithe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anduwaithe">Anduwaithe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376281/#Comment_376281" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T18:51:42+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  6:51PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think you could end up with a really juicy ethical dilemma - a ship full of ex-slaves who are fully capable of beating your ass and stealing your ship.

Especially when you take into account that part of the Wookiee PC's back-story is that he's a former slave, himself!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Wouldn't the next obvious complication be that the wookiies now need even more help?

Yeah, that's a definite possibility. I figure that would be one of the ways they try to convince the Wookiee PC (if not the other two PCs, as well) to go back there with them, so they can fight against Czerka Corporation and the slavers whom they allow onto the planet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376316/#Comment_376316" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T22:38:29+00:00" title="May  3, 2012 10:38PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sith Wookie!
