Amazing music, if you're into death metal.<br/><br/>2. Watched season one of Torchwood. I laughed, I cried. Never seen anything like it.<br/><br/>3. Been playing a lot of Rock Band with the wife.

I love that show. I like the girls, I like the fights, I like the guns, I like the car chases. I like the way that people are murdered. It's not as good as, say, The Wire, but it's a pretty good show.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126557/#Comment_126557" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:46:22+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:46AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>It's not as good as, say, The Wire</blockquote>\n5.

We were talking about them at work the other day. Wait, there was a thread here about NWs recently. Need to read that.<br/><br/>I was told that part of made the Night Witches so deadly (other than their utter disregard for their own safety) was the fact that they didn't track their targets the way their male counterparts do. Now, I know little about such things, but apparently, men fixate on targets, which can result in successful enemy flanking maneuvers. You're so focused on shooting this one guy, who's just out of range, that you don't pay attention to this other guy coming up behind you. He shoots you, you die. But female pilots perceived moving objects differently, and were not just focused on a single opponent at a time. This allowed them to avoid such entrapments.<br/><br/>Maybe you've read something similar...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126560/#Comment_126560" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:48:45+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:48AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

We're close to the two year anniversary of me quitting my suck-ass day-job and devoting full time to Evil Hat.  It feels like victory.<br><br>3. Speaking of Evil Hat, last weekend I hosted the first <a href="http://thatshowweroll.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=306591" rel="nofollow">Evil Hat Convocation</a> ever and finally got everyone actively doing stuff for the Dresden Files RPG sitting down around a table talking excitedly and openly about where they want to take the project and what needs to happen to get it done.  Juxtaposed with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, above, made it near on to one of the most exciting weekends I've had, ever.<br><br>4. Thanks to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, I've finally managed to fully delegate some responsibilities that I just wasn't having time for any more.  So I feel less like a speedbump and more like a team player again.  Rock!<br/><br/>5. I'm finally running a game again just to run a game, not to productize it.  I don't mind the product-development GMing experience, but I needed new cuisine on my plate to keep the flavors fresh and the palate stimulated.  My players collaborated to design the setting and it's awesome.<br/><br/>6. I've been talking with Ryan Macklin about his Mythender game and I'm FREAKING EXCITED about it.<br/><br/>7.

I will then be recruiting playtesters from here and elsewhere: I want others to try to run it and let me know what doesn't make sense, culturally/systemwise.<br><br>I've still got mental block with Ghost Killers, for which I might open a thread to get some help. Everything is awesome but the "Magic" section, which is a blank slate upon which I am having writer's block.<br><br>My "Let's discuss Japanese gaming and RPGs in English" group over at the social network website Mixi (kind of like a J-Facebook) has suddenly grown from like 1 other dude to 8!<br/><a href="http://mixi.jp/view_community.pl?id=3023459" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mixi.jp/view_community.pl?id=3023459</a><br/><br/>I'm working on a small, secret project that's like a mash-up between a forum and a blog. It's in testing right now, and I will probably destroy it and start again, but you can peek at it over at <a href="http://www.j-rpg.com/talk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.j-rpg.com/talk</a> &lt;-- Don't join, tho, It's going to have weird rules and stuff about joining/posting/etc.<br/><br/>Ewen and I haven't made public, really, our other secret Japanese gaming project, but we're translating and releasing a second J-RPG at GenCon this year. It's an extremely fun game that is so utterly Japanese you'll be bowing on the phone and buying beer from vending machines once you've bought it. Ewen is a translating monster.<br/><br/>Oh, I also saved Ashley, the president's daughter, from being turned into a brainwashed zombie slave. I also destroyed an evil zombie cult in Spain!

WOOT! My freelance check came in! Cartooning FTW!<br/><br/>2. I'm having a totally fun time teaching kids how to draw in an afterschool program! One of the kids said that when she grows up, she wants to teach how to draw, but she wants to do it for the money. <br/><br/>3. We are getting closer and closer to making RinCon '08 the coolest gaming convention ever -- the monthly game day is taking off and we're having a full day of organized play and open gaming for our one-year anniversary! COME TO TUCSON. (IdesOfGaming.com if you're interested.)<br/><br/>4. My project for the Mixed Media Book didn't suck but was still pretty awesome, despite me trashing my original concept and coming up with the final concept something like five days before it was due.<br/><br/>5. Jericho is back on the air and the annoying Mom character wasn't in the last two episodes!<br/><br/>6. I have the cutest little girl on the planet! Except when she's screaming because we won't give her cookies for dinner. But even then she's still very cute, if not very high pitched.<br/><br/>7. Uncle Bear found a ton of pirate coin tokens to use as Awesome Points, so there's going to be some Awesome Pirate Gaming Goodness in the future!<br/><br/>8. I downloaded Red Box Hack and want to start hacking the hack! I even got my mathie friends to give me a statistical breakdown of the probabilities of rolling a certain number or higher on 3d10, dropping the lowest die, versus just rolling 2d10! <br/><br/>9.

I went to OrcCon last weekend, and had a great time! I played <i>PTA</i>, <i>Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</i>, <i>Sons of Liberty</i>, <i>Mythender</i>, and <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>. Plus, good hanging with fun people! (sadly, I didn't get to <i>Business Solutions</i> or <i>Great Ork Gods</i>... I guess there's always Nerdly Beach!)<br/><br/>6. And then I played IAWA on Tuesday! The session wasn't perfect, but it was still fun, and I'm looking forward to the next chapter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
