Basically their was no reason to take action, which was obviously a problem.<br/><br/>The main mechanic works pretty well, and the structure is good, but there needs to be some tweaking to make the game more interesting and also incentivise the players to take action.<br/><br/>So here is what I want to add:<br/><br/>Applause: this would be a mechanic whereby the player would get a point everytime they engage in a piece of action or suggest a piece of action that is taken on by another player. It may tie in more to the mechanic ala inspectres e.g. everytime you pull a king you get a point of 'applause'. Needs some testing obviously. <br/><br/>The basic idea is that this would represent the audiences happiness with the film and their willingness to believe in the character.<br/><br/>Applause would be used to determine who gets to take down the nemesis at the end of the tale, eliminating the need for an arbitary role to determine it, or some complex group mechanic.<br/><br/>Does this sound like it would work and incentivise the players enough? I want to make it a little competitive basically.<br/><br/>Sidekicks: I would like to add in rules for people to play sidekicks rather than heroes. They would still get applause, but maybe for different reasons, assisting heroes etc. They wouldn't be able to take down the nemesis at all, but the applause they would gather would determine if they live or die, how they leave the film.<br/><br/>Anybody got any ideas on what sort of thing should be reflected in sidekick rules?<br/><br/>Random tables: I want to add in tables for inspiration, scene ideas, film ideas, name generators etc.<br/><br/>Written like board game rules: If you have ever played a board game from scratch you know that a lot of board games have their rules written to be understood by a new player. I want reel adventures to be playable out of the box, no need for rules prep.<br/><br/>So anyone got any suggestions, ideas, comments?<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
