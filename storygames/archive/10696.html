I have a non-game side project I am getting ready to work on. I need someone with graphics skills to create some (~10) simple icons for me. This is actually for a blog I'm starting up with what could be described as having a liberal bent. It's not strictly liberal, but let's just say, if you're liberal, you'll probably be on board with the project, if that helps. This is just a fun little project for me, i.e., no money, so I can't justify anything on the expense end. The icons would be simple, monochromatic images that are quickly recognizable, e.g., scales, an eye, etc. I could obviously go the clip art route, but I'm hoping to have a more unified look.<br/><br/>Here's where the tenuous gaming angle comes in: I'm willing to trade pdfs for any and all games I've published for the effort. This would include: Passages, Dawning Star, and any of my D&amp;D stuff, including my stuff from One Bad Egg. I can also give credit and a link to your website if you so desire. If you're interested, you can whisper me your contact info or e-mail me at jdj[at]floridacollections[dt]com, and I will provide more details about what's involved.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.
