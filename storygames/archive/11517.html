They were focussed at console games, I think, and read like a "ten commandments".<br/><br/>They were good, but I can't find them.

They are a little bit dated but altogether quite good for the purpose of video games.The story is what the player does, not what he watches.List the actions the player actually performs in the game and take a cold hard look at it. Does it sound like fun? (Resist the temptation to embellish. If a cinematic shows the player\u2019s character sneak into a compound, clobber a guard and put on his uniform, the player\u2019s action is \u201cWatch cinematic.\u201d Letting the player click to clobber the guard isn\u2019t much better.)The only significant actions are those that affect the player\u2019s ability to perform future actions. Everything else is bells and whistles.Design a clear and simple interface. The primary task of the interface is to present the player with a choice of the available actions at each moment and to provide instant feedback when the player makes a choice.The player needs a goal at all times, even if it\u2019s a mistaken one. If there\u2019s nothing specific he wishes to accomplish, he will soon get bored, even if the game is rich with graphics and sound.The more the player feels that the events of the game are being caused by his own actions, the better \u2014 even when this is an illusion.Analyze the events of the story in terms of their effect on the player\u2019s goals. For each event, ask: Does this move the player closer to or further away from a goal, or give him a new goal? If not, it\u2019s irrelevant to the game.The longer the player plays without a break, the more his sense of the reality of the world is built up. Any time he dies or has to restart from a saved game, the spell is broken.Alternative paths, recoverable errors, multiple solutions to the same problem, missed opportunities that can be made up later, are all good.Don\u2019t introduce gratuitous obstacles just to create a puzzle.As the player moves through the game, he should have the feeling that he is passing up potentially interesting avenues of exploration. The ideal outcome is for him to win the game having done 95% of what there is to do, but feeling that there might be another 50% he missed.</blockquote>\nLike so?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256559/#Comment_256559" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-14T11:29:58+00:00" title="February 14, 2010 11:29AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perfect, Mike, thanks very much.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256566/#Comment_256566" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-14T14:42:39+00:00" title="February 14, 2010  2:42PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can groove with all of these except <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2311&amp;Mode=like">#11</a>.
