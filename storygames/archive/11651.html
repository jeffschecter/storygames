Some years ago, when d20 was the new hotness, I got ahold of the <i>Seafarer's Handbook</i> and started thinking about new and interesting ways to implement it.  Because I'm always <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11184" rel="nofollow">thinking about fantasy games that revolve around a single race</a>, I hit upon the idea of an empire of merfolk that stretches from the shallow, sun-dappled waters near the coast to the cold deeps without a ray of light to reach them.  They would be at war with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahuagin" rel="nofollow">sahuagin</a> and involved in an uneasy peace amongst themselves.  Vast empires have to tie a lot of cultural threads together and the biggest rift I saw was that between the light-water and dark-water merfolk.<br/><br/>Anyway, I ran the game as a PBeM where it promptly disintegrated.  We had some interesting discussions before it cratered, mostly about practical matters such as how merfolk keep their food at a "table" when everything floats around, what methods of body decoration they'd use (scarification and piercing, but not tattooing) and the role of coloration and bioluminescence.  All good stuff.  But PBeMs invariably fall apart, even when the players seem engaged \u2014 it's a disease, what can you do? \u2014 and it ended too soon.<br/><br/>Because I only played it in a PBeM environment, I still think the concept has some legs (or fins).  And since d20's boom period appears to be over, I've been considering how best to implement things using more appropriate tools to the task.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed when people started coming up with characters is that they were interested in involving themselves in the nobility, or at the very least the upper crust of merfolk society.  I had originally thought they'd go for more of the classic "adventurer" roles, but they thought \u2014 and I came to agree \u2014 that the sort of storytelling that best fit the subject was that which touched on issues of the ruling elite.  It's an empire, and people wanted to be a part of that.  So d20 turned out to be an imperfect fit almost from the get-go.  It's not that it was useless, or anything, as it has a Noble class and all that, but there's nothing about the system that plays directly into that sort of gaming concept.<br/><br/>There has to be some violence \u2014 after all, what's a roleplaying game without bloodshed? \u2014 but it would likely be confined to the battlewaters on the front lines and the sort of (literal) backstabbing that goes on among noble types.  But for the most part it would be a game about passions in concert or conflict, the driving forces behind each character building out into a story.<br/><br/>Two games that come immediately to mind for this sort of thing are <a href="http://www.gregstolze.com/reign/" rel="nofollow">Reign</a> and <a href="http://www.housesoftheblooded.net/" rel="nofollow">Houses of the Blooded</a>.  I'll admit to having only made the most cursory of passes over both these games, so I don't know if they'd really fit or not.  Maybe someone can tell me yea or nay, and if they <i>don't</i> work perhaps suggest something else.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259866/#Comment_259866" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T08:43:38+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  8:43AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know what you think of it. but True20 is a fairly easy way to make use of D20 material but with a somewhat different approach.<br/><br/>Mind you, one problem with your setup, at least if you follow the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/sahuagin.htm" rel="nofollow">d20 description</a>, is that sahuagin have an average Int of 14 vs the merfolk's 10.

Just ask/answer some questions that "bubble out' of such an existence.<br/>* Communication is hard underwater--how do they do it? How has that affected their arts and laws?<br/>* Water pressure - how does their society address the fact there's depths to which they can't dive (or are there)? Is their a caste system around capability to dive?<br/>* Sustenance - how do they feed themselves: hunting and gathering, or husbandry and aquaculture? Does their society shape itself around providence?<br/>* Predation - are they the top of the (local) food chain? If not, how do they deal with predators; how does their society or architecture deal with such threats?<br/>* Dwellings - do they build or camp? Nomadic or territorial? Out of what do they build, beneath the waves (sculpted living coral, as a parallel with Tolkien elves and trees!)?<br/><br/>Pretty much look at human cultures and societies and technologies and ask if/how they'd come into being in an aquatic environment, or how they would be radically different for sea creatures. But don't go TOO alien, or you risk the sci fi writer's dilemma: making unsympathetic beings out of them, from which no human themes or parallels can be extracted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260895/#Comment_260895" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T07:16:26+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  7:16AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2010 7:16AM by FigureFour.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><br/>* Water pressure - how does their society address the fact there's depths to which they can't dive (or are there)?

There's also the riches one might expect from the undersea: pearls, exotic shells, nacre and all of that.
