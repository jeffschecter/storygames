Our first meeting is Sat Apr 19th at 5pm.<br/><br/>=================cross post===================<br/><br/>Meet other local Roleplayers for adventures and fun! Come to a Meetup to explore fantastic worlds, clash with dark monsters, spin lore and commit heroic feats while playing the greatest small press RPGs around!  I've set up a page to facilitate getting together as an Indie Games Group/Club/etc.  <a href="http://roleplayers.meetup.com/481/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://roleplayers.meetup.com/481/</a>  This is on the third Saturday of the month at 5pm so this will not conflict with the major holidays.  We will be meeting at the Joe Muggs Newstand/Coffee shop at the Summit with options to game at length at Legion Comics/Game store or at a meeting room nearby.<br/><br/>If your coming please join the Meetups and RSVP.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
