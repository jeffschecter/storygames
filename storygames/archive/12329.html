The siren's call of the ENnies has been sounded and the question goes out; who will answer? Do you think you have what it takes to be an ENnies judge? Do you have the fortitude to stand up against the barrage of RPG products, the reflexes to navigate the plethora of text and toys, and the will to emerge with the finest goods produced during the year? If so, then this is a great opportunity for you!<br/><br/>Starting on July 1, 2010, people will be able to throw their hats in the ring and nominate themselves. The last day for nominating will be July 11, so you'll have plenty of time to make your decision. Voting for the judges will take place alongside voting for products and the winners will be announced at the ENnie Awards ceremony on August 6, 2010. Keep any eye out for my next post with a link to the form.<br/><br/>If you want more information about the current judges, please visit the judges page on the ENnie Awards site: <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/about/judges.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ennie-awards.com/about/judges.asp</a>. Also, all current judges will be following this post, so feel free to ask questions of them.<br/><br/>If you are thinking about running, here's a list of criteria you'll need to remember. All judges must:\n<ul>\n<li>be at least 18 years of age as of August 6th, 2010 and able to enter into a legal contract;</li>\n<li>not have any professional relationship with any RPG publisher during the period from January 1st, 2009 to August 1st, 2011. Such relationships include unpaid work and work on free products;</li>\n<li>declare any relationship with any publisher (including EN Publishing, except for the Ceramic DM line) in which they receive money, product, or special consideration in exchange for their services;</li>\n<li>be able to read English and communicate clearly therein.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you have a relationship with a publisher, even as a playtester, it is important that you notify the ENnies board of this so that they may determine whether you are eligible to seek a judge position.  In  cases of rule violation, conflict of interest, misrepresentation, or other factor(s) detrimental to the awards, the Board of Directors retains the right to alter the composition of the judging panel at any time.<br/><br/>Physical location is irrelevant - so long as you can accept packages year-round.<br/><br/>When you apply, you will be expected to fill out a questionnaire to help people best gauge how well they think you'll work as a judge. Here a couple of sample questions:\n<ul>\n<li>What styles and genres of RPGs do you enjoy most? Are there any styles or genres that you do not enjoy? Which games best exemplify what you like?  Do you consider yourself a particular system\u2019s, publisher\u2019s or genre\u2019s \u201cfanboy/girl\u201d?</li>\n<li>How would you like to see the ENnies change (categories, policies, etc)?  What should remain inviolate?</li>\n</ul>\nIf you want to run, here is what is expected of you. All judges shall:\n<ul>\n<li>access the ENnie Awards boards/e-mailing lists (for the purposes of corresponding with judges and interacting with directors and staff);\n<ul>\n<li> weekly on the designated ENnies forums and sharing an accurate list of what products they have received;</li>\n<li> daily on the designated ENnies forums during judge deliberations (expected dates for 2011: June 1 - July 1);</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>act in a professional and impartial manner;</li>\n<li>sign a non-disclosure agreement;</li>\n<li>in the event that they are removed from office, bear the expense of returning and/or forwarding the products received for review;</li>\n<li>pay any customs duties charged for submissions;</li>\n<li>if they attend Gen Con \u2013 Indy, work a minimum of two hours at the ENnies booth;</li>\n<li>if they attend Gen Con \u2013 Indy, attend the awards ceremony smartly attired;</li>\n<li>report to the Submissions Coordinator and Business Manager.</li>\n</ul>\nAnd, besides being able to say "I'm an ENnies Judge!" what else do you get? Judges:\n<ul>\n<li>upon completion of reviewing, retain for personal use or otherwise dispose of products reviewed;</li>\n<li>receive a free Gen Con Indy 4-day pass.</li>\n</ul>\nTony Law<br/>ENnies Assistant Business Manager<br/><a href="mailto:tony@ennieawards.com" rel="nofollow">tony@ennieawards.com</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tonylaw74" title="tonylaw74"><img alt="tonylaw74" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rpgcentric.com/files/badgemaclaren2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tonylaw74">tonylaw74</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278908/#Comment_278908" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-01T05:33:09+00:00" title="July  1, 2010  5:33AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And the time is now, folks!

Likewise if you were in a position to ensure that any game you'd had a hand in wasn't entered - remember, entry is a deliberate act on the behalf of the publisher - you'd probably be acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that independence in the judges is important, though. So do many publishers... one who is a long-time friend and who has entered a game this year wrote to me and said "If I say anything out of line to you about the ENnies, just tell me to bu@@er off!" I'm sure he'd like a nomination, but he was prepared to go to lengths not to have an undue influence.<br/>\n<br/>\nApologies if this doesn't go as far as you would like, but I do think independent judges are important... I'm not going to say different to win votes. People who enjoy kicking ideas around and being creative are, of course, welcome. It's just that you cannot judge if you have something in contention yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279192/#Comment_279192" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-03T07:14:44+00:00" title="July  3, 2010  7:14AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "You haven't worked on anything due to be released this year or you know it won't be nominated" is a big difference from "You've never worked on anything with any publisher."

I do think that it is not unreasonable to ask someone who wants to be a judge to not participate in the production of any game for the year ahead of time (though playtesting should be exempt from that).  And I don't know if free or not makes much of a difference, given that the free category is becoming a hotly contested segment of the contest.<br/><br/>Also, being an ENnies judge is a huge job.  It sounds like you wouldn't have time to even have a regular job, let alone work on another game. <br/><br/>Graham and Ryan, I really think you guys are overstating the case. There are tons of pure "fans" in the story game community who don't produce anything and aren't interested in producing anything who could potentially be great representatives for this community among the judges.  Why does it have to be a designer?<br/><br/>Also, you have to look at the ENnies in a historical contest.  This is a contest that came from a D20-only world.  Given that, they have made great strides in the last couple of years.  There are people in the administration who didn't think that small press games should even be considered, let alone free ones.  They didn't think PDFs were "real" games only two years ago.  They are coming from a pretty myopic place and have done a lot to change this in the last two or three years (some internal shocks, though negative at the time, helped with that).  So I think you should take the long view, be a bit more appreciative and keep working on your campaign to get great story games representation in among the judges.<br/><br/>Finally, the real area where you should be pushing your agenda is at the judges themselves.  You get a lot of them who pop into every forum to introduce themselves during the nomination phase and then disappear.  The trick is to snag them, engage them and open their eyes.  A lot of these judges are ultimately just big gaming geeks who are honestly curious about the whole hobby and have just never been exposed to many of the various corners of it.  If you can open up lines of communication early (before the flood of products hits them), you can maybe get them to turn their heads to games they might not have otherwise fully appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279203/#Comment_279203" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-03T10:38:44+00:00" title="July  3, 2010 10:38AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Graham and Ryan, I really think you guys are overstating the case.

We've had a few years to come up with one.<br/><br/>But look at our community. We tend to promote creating shit, and that's what many, many of the alpha fans of story games (read: people who'll read this) do, in order to further engage in our conversation. As Elizabeth reminded us above, that includes playtesting. And we're very, very loose with our playtesting. We involve our fans hardcore -- we can't afford not to. You show me someone who hasn't playtested an indie game, and I'll show you someone who'll get at least three invites by next year. Those fans -- who aren't being creators themselves in a "larger" context -- are barred due to how our community works.<br/><br/>That's cool. That's their rule. I'm just not going to play pretend about us being a part of this process. As a tribe, we're only going to be consumers of the ENnies, not contributors. (And since we're a community *of* contributors, you should see where this rubs many people here the wrong way, either causing them to be mouthy or to just shrug at the ENnies and move on.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Also, being an ENnies judge is a huge job.  It sounds like you wouldn't have time to even have a regular job, let alone work on another game.</blockquote>\nI'm not saying I want the fuckin' gig. I like making shit. :P But I am saying that walking in here and making claims without understanding the community you're talking to, and why your rule is a shut door in their faces, is bullshit. Choosing to do that is fine, but talking like it's a positive thing here is ass. (Perhaps I was too damned polite and eloquent in my previous post to get the point across. Rectifying that now.)<br/><br/>Especially when instead of attempting to at least engage in sympathy (for instance: "yeah, I'm sorry that this rule has this impact on your involvement here. it's something we might be able to look at in the coming here, but I hope you appreciate how tricky the situation is for is."), what we get is a lecture on the need for "independent" judges. Turns out that lecturing a community you aren't involved in will just piss people off! Science is awesome, kids.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Also, you have to look at the ENnies in a historical contest.</blockquote>\nWhat part of "we're a secondary, perhaps initially unintentional audience" in my earlier comment did you miss?<br/><br/>I end up talking about the ENnies process every year, usually because of the podcasting angle. I *have* been watching the ENnies for the last four years, seeing them grow, try to fix problems. They're dealing with issues of growth, the whole "victims of success" bit. They're smart in not trying to change too much too fast, because doing so usually leads to disaster. So maybe at some point they'll find a way to solve this issue -- if they care to. But since that isn't today, you get threads like these.<br/><br/>The guys are extending the olive branch here, and that's really cool of them. They don't have to do that. The problem is that most of us as a community can't take it, and the follow-up conversation on their end reads as dismissal. It's like offering a beer to someone who doesn't drink. You know they won't take it, so it's a safe "polite" thing to do.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/reaction" title="reaction"><img alt="reaction" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/reaction">reaction</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279209/#Comment_279209" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-03T12:01:03+00:00" title="July  3, 2010 12:01PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I guess this is where I go ahead and campaign for judge-ship?

You can view my bio and information here : http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?page_id=745<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Ennies started in 2000 or 2001, a lot of innovation in gaming came from the third party publishers. The Ennies really helped in putting the spotlight on them and getting recognition. Now, these third party publishers have become stand alone companies. A lot of the innovation these days come from smaller press companies. I think the Ennies need to do something about giving them some recognition.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real problem is figuring how. Suggestions on this topic is certainly more than welcomed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for rules that prevents some candidates to present their candidacy, there's a few thing that can be done:<br/>\n1. The product is not submitted for the Ennies. It's a simple solution that may reach consensus.<br/>\n1. a) Playtesting shouldn't disqualify, but should be stated in the candidate entry.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The judge doesn't participate in evaluating the product.

I've actively avoided publishing anything because I'm happy taking on the role of a critic.  I've always enjoyed StoryGames, especially since Andy has built a great community here, but StoryGames is as focused in its own way an ENWorld is... and so I drift back to RPGnet.  I still lurk, but I admit it's mostly for Stuff to Watch and to keep an eye on new releases.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite><br/>Finally, the real area where you should be pushing your agenda is at the judges themselves.  You get a lot of them who pop into every forum to introduce themselves during the nomination phase and then disappear.  The trick is to snag them, engage them and open their eyes.  A lot of these judges are ultimately just big gaming geeks who are honestly curious about the whole hobby and have just never been exposed to many of the various corners of it.  If you can open up lines of communication early (before the flood of products hits them), you can maybe get them to turn their heads to games they might not have otherwise fully appreciated.</blockquote>\nI think this is a really solid idea.  The fact of the matter is that the judge nominees are going to hop around and compete for votes, though many of the past winners have almost no online presence, but after they're going to go back to familiar haunts.  As the ENnies pick up no one has time for regular forum participation, as there are dozens of blogs, podcasts, websites, and other entries to suck up computer time.  Spinning out a few ideas, really trying to sell a judge early on a different way of approaching a game, could work out well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279266/#Comment_279266" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-04T13:57:04+00:00" title="July  4, 2010  1:57PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being a playtester is not a bar to judging in the ENnies.

I have a few comments, if you don't me weighing in here.<br/><br/>Disallowing publishers/editors/writers etc. from being ENnies judges is a good rule in general.  As soon as someone that's identifiable as an "industry guy" becomes a judge, the awards are going to lose any credibility they've built up over the years.  Anyone that serves as a judge definitely shouldn't have any credits on games for the entry period covered by their judgeship (from May one year through April the next).  The rule should probably be adjusted to cover the previous year.<br/><br/>Also, I don't know how much influence judges have over this rule.  I know we have say in the distribution of categories and the products that get nominated, but I don't think we have a say in how judges are selected or what their qualifications should be (Tony can correct me if I'm wrong).  Afterall, you probably don't want the judges to have a say in who can be a judge.  I think that's a "business office" decision that's above the judges heads.<br/><br/>Although I've only been involved in the ENnies for a couple years now, I've been watching them (and participating through voting) since 2002 or so.  The ENnies have really come a long way in terms of including more of the community.  Is there still progress to be made?  Certainly.  <br/><br/>I'm interested to see something from the story-games perspective: look at <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?page_id=5" rel="nofollow">the list of ENnies submission from the past year</a> and tell me what submissions you think qualify as "story games."  ENnies judges are limited to reviewing only products that get submitted.  Could part of the problem be that not enough story games are being submitted?  <br/><br/>Anyway, I hope we can keep this line of communication open.  <br/><br/>-Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279291/#Comment_279291" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-04T18:55:52+00:00" title="July  4, 2010  6:55PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd rather the only invalidating quality for judges being if they have some sort of conflict of interest with the awards.

If this is incorrect or has been revised, I'm happy to be corrected on the matter.<br/><br/>-Ash<br/><br/>If you look on the submission guidelines for PDFs, you'll see the actual reason physical books are required: it's the entry fee. The books are necessary to compensate the judges and to auction off to help support the ENnies. So even if they allowed PDF only submissions, the cost for entry would still be fairly high to compensate, I'm sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skeld" title="Skeld"><img alt="Skeld" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skeld">Skeld</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279413/#Comment_279413" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-06T07:42:16+00:00" title="July  6, 2010  7:42AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2010 7:43AM by Skeld.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite> I have long advocated personally that the requirement of physical products only be dropped, allowing people to submit via PDF only... </blockquote>\nYou can find the <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/publishers/e-submissions.asp" rel="nofollow">rules for PDF-only (or electronic) submissions here.</a>.  The short answer is that if you have a product that is PDF-only, you fill out the entry form and submit your PDF along with a $5 entry fee (or $10 if you're submitting 2+ PDF products).  The PDF/electronic products have an entry fee because (unlike physical print products) the ENnies can't auction them off after the awards (which is how the ENnies are funded).  <br/><br/>Also, I can only speak for the past year, but we (the other judges and I) considered products for every category that seemed appropriate.  So, if your product was a PDF of a complete game, we at least considered it for best game.  If your PDF product included a map, we considered it for best cartography.  If it included art... you get the idea.  Granted, that doesn't mean that a PDF was a contender for that category, but it at least received consideration.  The other judges and I thought it was important to give every submission a fair shot in a many categories that made sense (obviously, if your book doesn't include art, it doesn't get considered for best art).  However, only PDF/electronic products were considered for the "e-book" category, so that's one that you don't have to share with physical products.<br/><br/>-Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kinetic" title="Kinetic"><img alt="Kinetic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kinetic">Kinetic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279434/#Comment_279434" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-06T10:15:15+00:00" title="July  6, 2010 10:15AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2010 10:20AM by Kinetic.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite><cite>Posted By: reveal</cite><br/>If you have a relationship with a publisher, even as a playtester, it is important that you notify the ENnies board of this so that they may determine whether you are eligible to seek a judge position.

It could very well be a mid-season adjustment.  We certainly had plenty of PDF-only submission last year.  I don't have an exact count since I'm at work, but I'd guess around 60 submissions in PDF/electronic format (that includes software and other digital formats).  My desktop monitor was overtaken with icons for several months.<br/><br/>I'm also not clear about the CD versus email angle.  Generally, submissions go through Hans Cummings, our submissions coordinator, then he would email us to let us know new stuff was available, and we would download it from an access-controlled location.  I don't know if there are any restrictions on media format, but I doubt it because there was early-on discussion about accepting products through email and CD (I vaguely recall someone having an email issue with large files).<br/><br/>-Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Princesskeyblade" title="Princesskeyblade"><img alt="Princesskeyblade" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Princesskeyblade">Princesskeyblade</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279580/#Comment_279580" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-07T12:28:04+00:00" title="July  7, 2010 12:28PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2010 12:36PM by Princesskeyblade.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am Tracey Michienzi and I am also running for ENnies Judge this year.

I appreciate that each of the judges are independent but I do think that the dialogue should be open about changes for the future, even if they are not implemented. The ENnies are evolving. It is my belief that the staff is trying to shake the stigma of being a D20 show. This year is the last year that the current business manager will be in charge. Tony will be taking over as ENnies Business Manager next year, and I think that he is really doing a great job of trying to open the dialogue between groups of gamers and the ENnies staff.

I came in last year as PR guy and, after she decided that this year was to be her last, offered me the position and I took it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>PS: The whole reason I came in here was to remind people that they had until July 11th to nominate themselves as a judge. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279774/#Comment_279774" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T07:12:08+00:00" title="July  9, 2010  7:12AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be your PR manager, Tony.

Ennies judges post here, once a year, then disappear. So the Ennies are involved in the community like wasps are involved in a picnic: they buzz around irritatingly, but if you keep your head down, they go away.<br/><br/>And we discuss things, but they never change.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong! I'm pretty comfortable with this. You guys are running awards that, basically, are aimed at big publishers. It's cool.<br/><br/>(Yes, I've seen the nominations. I'm glad a few indie games are nominated.)</blockquote>\nWell...  You're right.  It happens every year but its usually the reception people get that decides for them whether or not they'll stick around.  I didn't post here last year, I didn't even know about the site, but I found the site through the ENnies last year and have just been quietly following along.  The reason I registered this year was to shed light on the playtester disqualification comment.  But, after reading for a year and getting a fairly warm reception (all judges, not just me)... those are the types of things that make people stick.

I believe strongly in the integrity of the ENnie Awards, and wish no harm to come to their reputation or prestige, even among a vocal few, as a consequence of any action I have undertaken. I campaigned honestly and openly, and I see no evidence of any breach of confidence or immoral conduct on anyone's part. I would like to fervently thank those who have supported me thus far, and wish the remaining candidates the best of luck in the coming season. I'm sure I'll be talking to many of you before next year's electoral season, but for those who I don't -- see you then."<br/>--Kennon C. Bauman</b><br/><br/>The statement that led to his resignation was one made in an e-mail to his family and friends asking people to vote for him. Unfortunately, he worded his letter in such a way that one could construe that he wanted them to "stuff the ballot box." I have known Kennon for many years and I know that he did not mean this in any way, shape, or form and was just trying to help the receipients understand the voting process better. Although he was not asked to withdraw, he did so and we respect his decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12329/ennies-so-you-want-to-be-an-ennies-judge" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12329/ennies-so-you-want-to-be-an-ennies-judge" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12329/ennies-so-you-want-to-be-an-ennies-judge/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12329%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12329%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
