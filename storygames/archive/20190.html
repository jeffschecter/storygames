I hope to get a chance to play this soon, and the second edition is much more playable.<br/><br/>Some notes:<br/><br/>* Under "The Suspects", it's not clear what "take two turns each" means. The placement of that sentence makes it look like it's about inventing Suspects. However, did you mean that each player takes two turns in this phase of the game, period, and then we move on?<br/><br/>Maybe "take two turns each" should be the header for the entire section, if that's the case.<br/><br/>* How important is the number of Suspects? I'd imagine number of Suspects is just a variable for the duration of the game - the more Suspects, the longer the game, right?<br/><br/>* Is it possible for each player to portray a particular Suspect throughout the game, much like in an RPG? (This means that when you are the Detective, you only question other Suspects, but that shouldn't ruin anything.) Or does something go wrong if you try that?<br/><br/>* Errors:<br/><br/>"Before the questioning begins, takes all the<br/>remaining glass beads (starting at six) and let the<br/>person playing the Suspect to draw one without<br/>looking at them."<br/><br/>This should be:<br/><br/><i>Before the questioning begins, take all the<br/>remaining glass beads (starting at six) and let the<br/>person playing the Suspect draw one without<br/>looking [at them].</i><br/><br/>("At them" can be omitted without any loss of meaning.)<br/><br/>* The Secretary role seems redundant. Can't you just say that in this phase the Detective makes notes about the Suspects?<br/><br/>It could also be amusing to make the notes "in-character", with a little commentary.<br/><br/>e.g. <i>"Mr. Rhino was seen in the bathroom that night. (My first important clue, I feel!)"</i><br/><br/>It seems like it would, again, simplify the text a little.<br/><br/>* This part is confusing:<br/><br/>"The previous Suspects keeps the drawn<br/>glass beads, but returns them to the new<br/>Detective when there are only two left."<br/><br/>There is a small gramar issue which is confusing the sentence. If it is "The previous Suspects keep the beads...", that means each player keeps the beads they've drawn so far, then return them to the Detective. <br/><br/>If it is "The previous Suspect keeps the beads", then it is one person who holds them all.<br/><br/>I'm going to guess that it's the first, and recommend this rephrasing:<br/><br/>"The Suspects keep the beads they've drawn so far. When there are only two left, all Suspects return their beads to the Detective."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445460/#Comment_445460" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-01T16:40:30+00:00" title="June  1, 2015  4:40PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: the Woodperry Murder includes a few details absent from your text (e.g. that the Detective has already figured out who the murderer is).

I love when people find faults because then my game always turns out better. Thanks for the feedback. I really appreciate that. Made an updated version, and here are all the changes in the text.<br/><br/>THE DETECTIVE<br/>Everyone takes turns to play the Detective, who<br/>has already figured out who the murderer is. All<br/>the Suspects have been gathered in the parlor<br/>and it\u2019s time for the big reveal: who murdered<br/>Mr. Crow? The fun in playing this game lies<br/>in seeing a scenario grow in front of us while<br/>contributing to it following these three steps:<br/><br/>THE SUSPECTS<br/>Hand the pencil to the left.<br/>The pencil will go two times around the table.<br/>Create a total of five Suspects for a standard one-hour game.<br/><br/>THE MOTIVES<br/>... and let the person playing the Suspect draw one without<br/>looking. The color is then revealed to everyone.<br/><br/>THE NOTEBOOK<br/>The person who played the Detective will<br/>make notes on the paper about what has<br/>just been revealed. To distinct one fact from<br/>another, put bullets in front of the \xb7 facts \xb7<br/>and underline the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">motives</span>.<br/>/.../<br/>The glass beads are only returned to the<br/>Detective <i>when there are two beads left</i>.<br/>\n<blockquote>* How important is the number of Suspects? I'd imagine number of Suspects is just a variable for the duration of the game - the more Suspects, the longer the game, right?<br/><br/>* Is it possible for each player to portray a particular Suspect throughout the game, much like in an RPG?

Or does something go wrong if you try that?<br/><br/>/.../<br/><br/>It could also be amusing to make the notes "in-character", with a little commentary.</blockquote>\nIt's a design choice I made, to deliberately make it tight so people would like to break the rules and expand it. You don't have to use glass beads as tokens, you don't have to create suspects by picking names from a list. So I will leave those things to you. (You made me remove "recommended" in the part of how many suspects the group should create, so I'm more to the point and less "do what you want".)<br/><br/>As when it comes to each player having it's own character, however, that will create an ownership and it kinda goes against the collaborative feeling. I could be wrong, but I can picture a scenario where the players tries to protect their characters' innocence. You could play it like you said, but then you must change the text to address how everyone wants to kill Mr. Crow and make all players wanting <i>their</i> character to do it. Much like <b>Fiasco</b> makes all players wanting their characters' fates to go to hell.<br/><br/>I can see a <i>Kill Dr. Lucky: the roleplaying game</i> taking form. xD A cool idea.\n<blockquote>Also: the Woodperry Murder includes a few details absent from your text (e.g. that the Detective has already figured out who the murderer is). Do you agree with these, or is there some aspect of that version of the game which you do not consider fitting for Mr. Crow?</blockquote>\nThe Woodperry Murder is correct, and I see it as an expansion and clarification of my version. The only major difference between 1ED Murder Mr. Crow and the World War skin is the number of Importants, where Woodperry Murder has each person add 2-3 things. That's 10-15 things for a 5 player group while the original has only five for that amount of players.<br/><br/>I guess that, sometimes, not all objects are used in the skin, and that's the only difference it makes in-game.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The Murder of Mr. Crow is now at version 2.2.<br/><a href="http://www.urverkspel.com/vara-spel/oevriga-projekt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.urverkspel.com/vara-spel/oevriga-projekt</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445469/#Comment_445469" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-02T12:25:54+00:00" title="June  2, 2015 12:25PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I will promote this also for our local group (we will have a Nano/Indie day in summer).</blockquote>\nThanks!

That game will be tested one day. I have no idea what kind of target audience these games got. That's up to me to find out some day.\n<blockquote>Why is it important to specify that the Detective already knows who the murderer is?</blockquote>\nThere are a bunch of vague reasons. Mostly because it follows the genre in how Sherlock Holmes (and others) does his revelation. Another reason is that I wanted to avoid acting out in character. That still happens, and it can be a nice flavor, but it's not a focal point for this game.<br/><br/>The third, and most important, reason is that if the facts are already established, that will make the players playing the Detective more sure of themselves. If we were instead to play out the interrogation, the facts could be questioned. Now they are already "established" through that little sentence that the Detective already has done the groundwork. The facts are already proven, and all that is left is to reveal them.<br/><br/>But all in all. It's probably not <i>that</i> important.<br/><br/>But I can say that I created the structure of play first, by asking myself "How can I create a <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2/" rel="nofollow">fish tank</a> in a collaborative way?", and then found a genre suited for it. So the questions can be said to belong to the genre, but I came up with the structure of creating a scenario through questions and then picked the genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445515/#Comment_445515" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-04T17:39:16+00:00" title="June  4, 2015  5:39PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2015 5:40PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes a lot of sense.
