I've started up shows before but never finished a season, and man, it was a blast. Completing a whole season added so much meaning to the story, and it was so much more satisfying than, say, a single pilot episode or an aborted season.<br/><br/>The show took place in Japan in the latter part of the 19th century, during the Meiji Restoration period. It was basically about efforts to set up a Western-style school in a small town near Tokyo (or Edo), but it was really <i>about,</i> of course, the personal issues and relationships of the characters. Dirty plots, secret romances, past guilts, and family obligations, oh my!<br/><br/>It particularly struck me about the play experience that the rules were remarkable in facilitating the interchange of ideas between participants. Just having the flow of Screen Presence and the individual Issues before us had a huge impact on the discussions. <br/><br/>For instance, Episode 4 was the spotlight episode for Kanako, whose Issue was that she was torn between her obligations and her feelings for Shigeharu, an old fiance. Episode 5 would be Shigeharu's spotlight episode. Keeping that in mind, we discussed how each scene would fit into Kanako's issue ("Why don't we have Shigeharu's uncle wanting him to marry his cousin Yoko? That ought to get Kanako angsting about her Issue.") and how the scene would set things up for the next episode to spotlight Shigeharu and his Issue properly. ("Yeah, and the uncle could come speak to Kanako, to convince her to back off!" "Conflict!" "If the uncle succeeds and Shigeharu finds out, he's going to be so pissed next episode and feel even more guilt, and that's his Issue...") The end result was a story that no one predicted and no one prepared in advance for, yet fit together smoothly as a whole and was satisfactory to everyone.<br/><br/>One thing we did differently from the original rules was that there was no single Producer. Different people Produced different scenes, usually because their protagonist didn't play a big role in the scene or because they had a good idea of what it would look like. I suggested it partly for selfish reasons, I'll admit--I wanted to play, damn it, not be the Producer all the time!<br/><br/>The decision did, however, have an interesting consequence because I think it contributed to a breakdown of the traditional PC party and the adventuring narrative. The four protagonists had very little in common (a famous geisha, her student, a missionary-educated young man, and a broken survivor of the Shinsengumi battles) and there weren't even a lot of scenes where they all showed up together. They were four people with interlocking relationships and destinies, no more. If your character didn't show up in a scene, you were likely to be Producing it or contributing to the discussions anyway.<br/><br/>A consequence of this party breakdown was that protagonist vs. protagonist Conflicts were very common. In the earlier episodes the Budget went almost untouched, to the point where we made up a new rule that activating a Trait would cost a Budget point in a protagonist vs. protagonist Conflict. Overall, though, Budget wasn't something we thought about a whole lot, since there was no single Producer to have proprietary control over it.<br/><br/>So that was our show. To us it really was the best show that never was, and truly an awesome role-playing (or story-gaming, rather) experience. PtA is truly effective in harnessing the enthusiasm of the participants for a great story, the corollary being that there has to be a lot of enthusiasm in the first place. That makes a fully participatory series creation process a must. PtA is the engine; enthusiasm is the fuel. By playing and producing a full season I've really come to appreciate the elegance and effectiveness of that engine, and the awesomeness of the fuel.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139630/#Comment_139630" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T13:24:52+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  1:24PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A consequence of this party breakdown was that protagonist vs. protagonist Conflicts were very common.</blockquote>\nI'm not saying that this is a bad thing, but that's also actually a local rules change you made, just so that you know - in the rules as written, there is no such thing as a direct protagonist vs. protagonist conflict. All conflicts gets rolled against the Producer, and the Producer always spends budget. This basically requires that each PC in a conflict have different stakes. So you have to think a bit about how to phrase things when PCs seem to be in direct opposition.<br/><br/>So if we're in a fist fight, and my Issue is Guilt, and yours is Anger Management, my stakes might be "do I hurt you so bad that it makes me feel guilty and want to make amends later", and yours might be, "does my anger get the better of me and make me go too far". Note that these are two ways of saying, "does the other person get hurt bad", but they carry different enough meaning in the fiction that each combination produces differently colored results.<br/><br/>So, say neither of us get our stakes there. We rough each other up a bit, but the fight gets broken up. Say we both do. You go nuts and try to kill me, and I'm forced to seriously hurt you in self-defense. We both go to the hospital. Say one of us does and the other doesn't. The other ends up in the hospital, and further scenes revolve around either my guilt or how you can't control your temper.<br/><br/>Also, cool AP report.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139670/#Comment_139670" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T19:40:12+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  7:40PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We just finished our first complete season last night as well, and I agree completely with what you're saying.
