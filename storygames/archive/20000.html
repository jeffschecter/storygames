We\u2019re creating our parents as we name them, and in that first word we\u2019re already perverting them to meet our expectations, our needs and desires. That first word is a request or a demand, and never anything else. Even God created the universe with words. Even He is a liar. Even He only knows what He says He knows. And you\u2019re asking me if I did it? And you expect the truth, and nothing but?\u201d \u2013 Grigory Kozlov,</i> Notes on an Interrogation <i>(transl. F. H. Barrett)</i><br/><br/> Inspired by films like Rashomon and fiction\u2019s many unreliable narrators, Innocence is a game about how the perspective of the storyteller shapes the story told. In the game, multiple narrators will tell their version of a contentious event\u2014an event in which they have a personal stake, and about which they have every reason to lie, even to themselves.</blockquote>\nBasically, this is a rules-lite storytelling game designed to allow players retell the same story from different perspectives, with the story changing with each narrator. You can find the alpha draft <a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/innocence/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Since this is an alpha draft, I'm eager for feedback, and extra eager for feedback from anyone willing to play it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442383/#Comment_442383" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-02T17:56:18+00:00" title="February  2, 2015  5:56PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope to get a playtest of this at Con of the North, Dreamation, or Camp Nerdly.<br/>It is right up my alley, sincerely, but you know how hard rustling up players can be sometimes. ;-)<br/>Thanks for putting this together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442384/#Comment_442384" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-02T18:01:09+00:00" title="February  2, 2015  6:01PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!
