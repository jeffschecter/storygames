                    Ever since first hearing about Keys over on RPGnet, I've been interested in tSoY, reading threads and Actual Play. I forgot about it for a while, concentrating on other stuff, until after the second edition, when I found the link to the text files on crngames.com and so once again took a look at the actual game rules. (Don't really buy games unseen, so I didn't have much of a chance before.)<br/><br/>Now, the Keys and advancement system in general rocked just as much as when I first heard about them. As far as I'm concerned, they are pure awesome. The pools and how they Refresh are nifty. Also, I like large parts of the setting, the take on elves, the cultures and their themes, that's all interesting and looks like fun.<br/><br/>Still, something doesn't feel right about the game. I can't put my finger on it but something bugs me. For one thing, I get the impression of redundency in the abilities, without any discussion of wether they all overlapp (So one could use both, dunno, "Bladework" or "Scrapping" when fighting with a knife, without any mechanical difficulties.) or wether they don't. (Like: You have to use Scrapping and Bladework is just for non-combat cutting, or something.) On the other hand, I find it strange that there is no open "trained fighting" ability, what with Scrapping being defined as "untrained fighting". With Secrets, I have similar "Something doesn't fit" feelings, with some Secrets being very usefull and others not really seeming power- or usefull enough to qualify as a Secret. (As opposed to just a regular part of the Ability.) Also, it seems strange when, in a game otherwise using only abstract measures of "movement" (if that), there's suddenly a Secret that allows you to push people back [Success Levels] Yards.<br/><br/>Now, I'll be the first to aknowledge that I have no actual play experience with tSoY whatsoever and that even my reading experiences onlycome from <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/tsoy2/book1--rulebook.txt" rel="nofollow">the free/open version of the rules</a> and <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/tsoy/book2--world_of_near.html" rel="nofollow">the free/open and possibly outdated version of the setting</a>, so chances are good that my impression is mistaken. But that's exactly why I started this thread: To get feedback from people who like tSoY and have more actual experience then me. (Which would be more or less everybody. ^_^ )<br/><br/>Did I actually find real/potential issues or are my doubts unfounded in actual play? How does it play? The impression I get from the rules is that it plays like a relatively normal fantasy game while allowing for very player-driven gaming. (through Keys, for example) How do the rules influence and shape play?                </div>

                            I love TSoY and play pretty much weekly.  We've used it for swords and sorcery stuff, historical stuff, and sci-fi stuff.  In each instance it's required a retooling of the list of abilities, secrets, and keys to suit the setting.  That is fun work, at least to me.<br/><br/>In play the game works very well.  As a GM you have very explicit things your players are telling you they are interested in (keys) and cool things they want to do to show off (secrets).  Lump these together, contrast them, challenge them, and you've got a very easy time of prep - in fact, you can't really do extensive prep anyway, since players have a lot of authority.  <br/><br/>As a player, you know what you want and you are rewarded for going out and getting it.  When it gets dull, you get even more reward for dropping it.  It's hard to be disengaged.  TSoY's really fun.                        </div>

                            I hear what you're saying, Minx, and to some extent I share those opinions: some Secrets are more powerful than others, and some Keys seem easier to hit.  But I'm not sure that "balance" in the D&amp;D sense is a major design consideration in SOY.  Things are <i>roughly</i> balanced, and that suffices.  (The great thing about SOY, of course, is that you can very easily tweak any of the Secrets, Keys, or whatever: the game was designed for easy customization.)<br/>
<br/>
As to the abilities: I've never found them to be duplicative.  Frankly, I <i>like</i> that there's no "open" trained fighting skill.  How people beat the snot out of other people is highly culturally contingent in the real world, and that's been a huge factor in shaping our history.  I like how SOY nods to this, personally, but YMMV.                        </div>

<p>The lack of the trained fighting skill threw me for a loop at first too.  But then Mark Causey pointed out to me that there were these very specific fighting skills listed in the back of the book.  In the sections specific to different cultures.   Which we decided meant that we should be authoring our own cool new fighting styles specific to the cultures we were bringing to the game.  More specificially, we felt it was squarely in the hands of the individual players (as opposed to just the GM) to author nifty fighty skills.</p>
<p>The intersting thing being that I don't think anyone in our group took any fighty skills.  And we haven't had more than one bloody conflict since the game began.  Which says something nifty all by it's self, I think.</p>

                            I've been doing some pretty serious hack-and-reassemble with TSOY myself lately. I had a similar problem with the vagueness of the abilities until I started trying to make my own fix. Now I think the vagueness is just fine and rather useful. Nevertheless, I think there are some ways to hack it to your own ends:<br><br>1. Have a really tight canonical list of relatively few abilities which are very thoroughly explained. Shadow of Yesterday works this way, I think.<br/>2. Have lots and lots of overlapping abilities. e.g. medicine handles healing, but herbology can also be used for some healing. Bladework covers fighting with swords, and deuling covers fighting with specific types of swords. Deuling might not include sabre fighting, but might include sizing up an opponent or knowing how and when to set up a duel properly.<br/><br/>I've had similar concerns with the keys, and I've made my own system of keys that I think works more tightly for the specific game I want to run.                        </br></br></div>

                            I think Tony's on the right track.  Something that I think has worked well for our TSOY campaign is that our GM basically created a list of open Secrets and abilities that were in keeping with the kind of campaign he wanted to run, which meant cutting some from the original text and adding some other ones that he wrote.  Same thing with Keys.  Then, as the game progressed, we as players wrote our own Secrets and Keys to go along with where our characters were going.  For example, my character is an albino ratkin shaman, and the GM and I got together and figured out what kinds of badass shamanic powers she should have, and how to write Secrets for those.  We ended up borrowing from the Khalean Green World (we have a Red World that links the life force of animals and humans) and from the Qek spirit communication to create some stuff that's really freaking cool and creepy.<br/><br/>On the other hand, some of those Secrets that seem kind of bizarre and maybe not as powerful can end up being really handy later on, because you never know what a player will see in the Secret that you've missed.                        </div>

                            Thanks <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">guys</span> people, good to see I wasn't the only one who thought like that. I think if I ever get to run something tSoY-related, I'd probably do something like Tony and Kirsten did, ie. rewrite the thing to tailor it to the specific game. This way, I can have the awesome without getting these mixed feelings.<br/><br/>BTW, Kirsten, do you still have that rewrite? I'd also be interested in seeing other peoples take on tSoY. (One of the things that sold me on DitV were the interesting rewrites like "Jedi in the Vineyard", so maybe it will be the same with tSoY.)<br/><br/>Aaron                        </div>

                            Hi Aaron,<br/><br/>I don't have all the stuff, since it was mostly our GM who did the retooling, but I do have some examples of Keys and Secrets we created specifically for the game.<br/><br/>Keys:<br/><br/><b>Key of Scorn</b> (for ratkin, although it could work equally well for goblins or other hated races)<br/><br/>1XP every time someone reacts badly to you based solely on your race<br/>3XP every time you are in danger of injury or death due to your race<br/><br/><b>Key of Uncontrollable Power</b> (this one was for an elf who's been having problems with his aura)<br/><br/>1xp Every time power manifests in a scene when you didn't want it to, it causes a nuisance, or identifies you <br/>3xp Every time it causes you harm or jeapordizes something you were trying to accomplish<br/><br/>Secrets:<br/><br/><b>Secret of Blood Transport </b><br/><br/>Allows Lutra and others to enter the Red World on a successful Life-Bond [I believe we made up this ability as well] check. Must cut self or draw blood, and must be in physical contact with anyone who comes with. Cost: 1 Vigor for self, 1 Vigor for each passenger. <br/>[Life-Bond checks also determine how successful Lutra is in navigating the Red World]<br/><br/><b>Secret of the Spirit-Talker </b><br/><br/>You have the ability to make contact with ghosts and ancestral spirits, with a successful Prayer check. The ancestral spirits your character honors regularly can be contacted at any place and time, but most other spirits are tied to a specific place (a tower, a temple, a standing stone) and must be contacted in that location. You may use this Secret to speak to spirits, but actually obtaining useful information or favors may require a contest. Cost: 2 Reason<br/><br/>This one isn't so much a modification as just a cool example of how one can create imbued "weapons" for social contests.  It basically allows my character to use Counsel against her estranged, insane sister during BDTP. <br/><br/><b>Secret of Natural Weapons: Maughyra's Scar</b><br/><br/>Lutra bears a scar across her right thigh, given to her by Maughyra when Maughyra was first teaching her to scrap. This scar represents a +3 "weapon" when Counsel is used against Maughyra during Bringing Down the Pain, and symbolizes the sisters' blood connection. <br/><br/>One of the other PCs is a pirate, so we wrote up this Secret for her ship.  I'm pretty sure this is our own invention, modded from the Secret of the Retainer.  I could be wrong, though -- it's sometimes hard to remember what we've made up, and what's actually in the text.<br/><br/><b>Secret of the Swift Vessel: The Reaver (formerly called the Cormorant) </b><br/>You have one of the faster sailing ships of the seas at your disposal. You receive a bonus die on any check to outmaneuver or outrun another seafaring vessel. In some cases, this may provide a bonus die on strategy checks when attacking an enemy vessel since you can outflank faster than they can react. <br/><br/>I hope this is helpful!                        </div>

Hey Kirsten,<br/><br/>My concern for these two keys is that they don't give the players something they can concretely do in order to get XP, it is then entirely up to the GM to create events that cause the XP.<br/><br/>How did they work for you in play or did the players just seek out situations where such situations were easy?                        </div>

                            That's a very good point, although it wasn't really an issue for us.  For the Key of Scorn, it was quite easy to gain XP simply by walking through town, since our game was set in a city in Maldor that was not friendly toward ratkin at all.  It was actually created in response to another player who was concerned that by playing a ratkin, he would constantly be in danger and wouldn't get anything out of it...  Since I took this Key along with Species (I don't have my book here, so I'm not sure if actually from the text, or if it's another one we made up...) and Conscience, it was pretty much guaranteed that my character was going to end up in situations where her status as ratkin was very much an issue.  I can't really speak to the second one, since because of scheduling I wasn't often playing in the same sessions as the player whose character had that Key.<br/><br/>You're very right, though, in that those are passive Keys that function more like flags to the GM than directives to the player.  I don't think the Key of Scorn would work as well if it wasn't paired with other Keys that push the player toward trouble, and in fact, I think I hit that key much more frequently than the other person who was playing a ratkin, since I was pushed to get involved in dangerous situations.  He took the Key of Cowardice along with it, which meant that he just did a lot of avoiding trouble, instead of jumping into it and hitting three keys at once...  <br/><br/>Incidentally, I ended up buying off the Key of Scorn during our last session, and took the Key of Vengeance against a specific ratkin oppressor instead, which was pretty hot, although it was a little difficult to determine just what the buy-off scene would look like.<br/><br/>Really, the more I think about it, the more I think those two keys are ok for our purposes, but don't really excell at doing what keys should do -- they don't let the player drive the action as much as they ideally should.                        </div>
