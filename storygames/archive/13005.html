I love the format, the way the pages look, how it hints at things rather than fills them in, and the voice of Oghma castigating the reader.<br/><br/>Also, we played Sorcerer last year (see <a href="http://outsidetheredbox.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/sorcerers-in-casablanca-serge-denis-moliere/" rel="nofollow">Sorcerers in Casablanca</a>) and Serge was one of the most intense characters I've ever played.  There's also a big relief having John there to help me with the rules - he was the last Sorcerer GM.<br/><br/>The players asked me what I was 'going for' beyond just playing Mu, and I said "I want each of the characters to be worthy of being the star of their own novel."  They definitely delivered. <br/><br/>Hamaan's just killed Nimrote and sparked a gladiator uprising - he's got a hundred problems about to land on his head.  Hamaan's drive goes deeper than just victory though - he wants to make something good in this terrible place.  Mike sees him as a city-founder, but we'll see what happens as I mire him in the backstabbing that's already rife in that arena and its surround.<br/><br/>Peter's character Uzal has this painfully close relationship with Oghma, who was the only person he's encountered that deals with him without recoiling.  Armed with the dictionary and hell-bent on saving the ailing dictionarist, Uzal intends to find the Damsel Messiah and take Oghma kicking and screaming to Urt. Uzal also has a lot of dread - dread of his own demon, Leviathan, especially.  I know I'll have to hit on these relationships very hard, since otherwise Uzal is such an outsider.  <br/><br/>I once asked John what it would take for him to summon a demon - he said 'Something big, it'd have to be the kids kidnapped or something.'  Now he's placed himself in the shoes of a man who's done just that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293159/#Comment_293159" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T07:44:57+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  7:44AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I did a color map of Marr'd, I'll post a picture of it after the next game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293178/#Comment_293178" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T09:01:27+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  9:01AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved the Casablanca write-ups and this looks to be every bit as engaging.

Cities require agriculture, otherwise everyone just leaves as soon as they get hungry. So having the capital at Mu's Bed amounts to an act of tyrrany in and of itself.  Water, food, everything has to be imported from the lowlands in Lemuria, at a tremendous cost to society, just so the Witch King can sit in a madhouse where the wind howls like a banshee.<br/><br/>So there's this hardscrabble agriculture barely hanging on in Lemuria, and the lower nobility has the job of maintaining this tiny agriculture base.  Hence Lemurian Hydrogogues - each answering to a Stygian Witch-Lord.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293299/#Comment_293299" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-14T03:55:31+00:00" title="September 14, 2010  3:55AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does anyone have a copy of a blank dictionary page?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293570/#Comment_293570" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T06:22:40+00:00" title="September 16, 2010  6:22AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game night is tonight, I've got minimal prep done.

Here's its profile:<br/><br/><i>Background</i><br/> <br/>Uzal was created by three nameless grey slaves of the Atlantean Mistress Aristea.  This creation was carried out in secret as unsanctioned reproduction of slaves was forbidden by their masters.  Uzal was crafted from the bones and shells of long dead Atlantean sea creatures and citizens (stolen from tombs and ruins) as well as dead grey slaves and aborted Atlanteans Uzal was a hideous amalgamation.  Before Uzal was fully complete it was discovered by Aristea who was offended and repulsed by the grey slaves' work. Uzal was intended to be an homage to the Atlantean mistress.  Instead, a sickened Aristeia had Uzal and the three artisans "flushed" from Atlantis before it could be completed.<br/> <br/><i>Appearance</i><br/> <br/>Uzal is androgynous, 6' 4" tall, lanky, boney, and has mottled skin (ranging from coarse, grey and leathery to smooth, pink and soft).  Its limbs are unnaturally long and joints are bulbous and protrude from beneath its flesh.  Uzal's ribcage is pronounced and crafted from ancient whale bones.  Parts of its body appear incomplete and certain parts are covered with scales and plates from extinct sea creatures.  Its jaw is incomplete yet is able to speak.  The voice comes from within but without the movements of the jaws.  Its voice echoes as if someone speaking into a conch and its breathing sounds like a shell against your ear.<br/> <br/>Uzal wears the wrappings of Atlantean mummies combined with long dark robes and hood of a wasteland wanderer.  It carries a large harpoon with a long bladed tip and a blunt hook on the other end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293585/#Comment_293585" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T07:31:40+00:00" title="September 16, 2010  7:31AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I'm sure you know, a lone monster eking out an existence in the Wastes is problematic to write bangs for.  What does he care about?  Why doesn't he just leave?  <br/><br/><i>The early years</i><br/> <br/>Uzal and the three Gray artisans scavenged Atlantean ruins and survived on rats and drinking from the Atlantean sewage.  While the Grays helped Uzal survive, they also were naturally inclined to obey Uzal\u2019s demands.  Also, they did not speak, although Uzal found itself with this ability, inherited somehow from Aristeia. <br/><br/>Thus, Uzal had a very difficult early upbringing, devoid of normal socialization.  <br/> <br/><i>Finding Leviathan</i><br/> <br/>Lured by a voice Uzal came to a large museum, where he saw the bones of a great sea creature.  He was struck by the awesome size of the beast.  The bones had been suspended once by wires, but the weight had eventually brought down the dome overhead.  This was the source of the voice: The Leviathan, a dead whale-spirit that was in desperate need, lying tangled on the dirty marble floor amongst scattered artifacts of its long dead era.  Like Uzal, Leviathan\u2019s barely discernable voice was desperate for water, but Uzal was clever enough to know not to naively approach such a demon without a plan.  <br/><br/><i>Binding Leviathan</i><br/><br/>Uzal dug a pit, touching sand that was just infinitesimally moist.  Then, using Uzal\u2019s own blood, urine, puss and bodily fluids Uzal managed to fashion a tiny \u2018sandwell\u2019 in the sand outside the museum\u2019s gates.  Leviathan, driven mad with need, dove into that well.  Within the confines of that space Uzal uses ropes, hooks, and the harpoon that slew Leviathan to try and make the demon submit.  While the demon appears to be tamed its thrist and yearning for water is evident.  <br/><br/>With Leviathan, Uzal creates a strange bond \u2013 Leviathan is far older and more knowledgeable than Uzal, whose mind is soon filled with the demon\u2019s words.  A strange bond is created where the child (Uzal) feeds the parent (Leviathan).  Leviathan becomes Uzal's tutor and educates him, engendering a warped world view as well as teaching Uzal even more sorcerous secrets.  <br/><br/><b>Ry says:</b>Leviathan is the biggest demon of the three summoned by the PCs.  He's enormous, vicious, and his need - to be given water - is something I need to keep in mind constantly.<br/><br/><i>Wandering the deserts</i><br/> <br/>Tempted by Leviathan's insistence that the world beyond would hold more water, Uzal, the three Gray Slave Artisans and Leviathan left the squallor of the Atlantean ruins.  Early encounters with humans did not go well; Uzal's appearance, chilling aura and lack of social graces were too much to overcome.  Encounters with people often ended badly for the strangers which began the legend of a wandering dark figure in the dessert.  Stories are conflicting ranging from ravaging monster to good samaritan leading some to belive that the Desert Wanderer is more animal than man... much in the way an animal is dangerous when cornered but relatively safe in other situations.<br/><br/>This is all stuff Peter typed up, by the way.  I've just done minor edits here and there based on later conversations.  Three more encounters (chapters in Uzal's life) and we'll get to Oghma, and Peter's kicker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293591/#Comment_293591" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T08:31:08+00:00" title="September 16, 2010  8:31AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Uzal and the Hoardlings</i><br/><br/>Uzal and Leviathan tyrranized some shrunken people called Hoardlings (they look like short, withered humans, but their mannerisms are more like prarie dogs).  Hoardlings are clayworkers and keep water in buried urns, many of which Uzal and Leviathan consumed or destroyed.  This chapter ended badly, as the Hoardlings were collectively weakened against external forces.  A group of worm-riding raiders attacked, and Uzal and Leviathan fled.  Uzal lost 2 of the Gray Slaves to those raiders (they were sold to Nimrote to entertain onlookers at Black Rock).<br/><br/><i>Uzal and the Primite Prince</i><br/><br/>Uzal came upon the Primite Prince freeing slaves, and at Leviathan's urging proceeded to steal the Prince's water.  He does not know if the Prince managed to survive the journey.

Oghma is the first person who was not repulsed by Uzal's hideous appearance.  Shortly after their first encounter a sand storm sweeps in and catches Uzal and Oghma by surprise when they are separated from Leviathan and Three, Uzal\u2019s last remaining Gray Slave. <br/><br/>Seeking shelter near some rocks Oghma stumbles, and inhales sharp shards of glass that are whipping through the storm.  He is also badly cut on his hands and face.<br/><br/>Uzal realizes they cannot stay in the area, and supports Oghma.  Oghma guides Uzal to an abandoned, low pyramid that while not functional for transportation was suitable for shelter.  Also, the pyramid had a curious property of time passing more slowly inside of it.  Realizing that his time is limited Oghma takes the time to share as much of his knowledge as he can with Uzal.  <br/><br/>Within the pyramid, time is so slow that Uzal finds himself drawn to and amazed by Oghma, experiencing for once an instant and powerful bond with another person.<br/> <br/>Here's what Oghma gives Uzal......<br/>1)  The first real friend he's ever had<br/>2)  Hope that there is a place for a creature like Uzal<br/>3)  A world view to help temper the info shared by Leviathan<br/>4)  All the knowledge in the Dictionary of Mu.<br/><br/>The Pyramid makes the days of the sandstorm seem like a year, and despite the darkness this year is one of the best of Uzal\u2019s strange life.<br/><br/>As Oghma slips into a coma Uzal decides that it is his duty to take Oghma to the Damsel Messiah in hopes that she can heal him and perhaps find a way to the oceans of Urt.  <br/><br/>Oghma and Uzal had discussed the Damsel Messiah many times.  Despite Oghma\u2019s misgivings, Uzal became entranced by the concept of such a person, and dearly hopes to join the 144,000 that ascend from Marr\u2019d.  Oghma dismissed such goals, saying that Marr\u2019d deserved better, and the argument reached a standstill as Oghma became unable to speak.<br/><br/>Using the ark as a stretcher Uzal loads Oghma onto it and with the help of Leviathan they "set sail" for the Damesel Messiah.  They strike out north, heading towards Black Rock to avoid crossing through the heart of Lemuria.  Three, the remaining Gray Slave, accompanies them in silence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293595/#Comment_293595" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T08:49:10+00:00" title="September 16, 2010  8:49AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see my options for Uzal:<br/><br/>Push hard on the crucial relationships with Uzal, that pull in different directions: Leviathan vs. Oghma.  <br/><br/>Leviathan isn't averse to trying to make for Urt, but Oghma is dead weight to that plan.

That... leaves me feeling a bit queasy, for reasons I'm struggling to articulate.<br/><br/>I guess it feels like it's a Kicker that's already been opened up, and has now gone stale like an old half-drunk beer.<br/><br/>Ron said it a lot better than I can, so I'm going to copy a few things out of Sorcerer to help illustrate what I mean (and all emphasis in the following has been added by me):<br/><br/>"The Kicker is an event or realization that your character has experienced <b>just before play begins</b>.  It catalyzes him or her into action of some sort."  <br/><br/>"Kickers are central to Sorcerer.  They provide <b>the opening conflict</b> that establishes a player-character as a protagonist."<br/><br/>One of the examples:  "You open your suitcase after picking it up at the luggage carousel to find your clothes and stuff gone, replaced by a quarter of a million dollars."<br/><br/><br/>In contrast, Uzal's Kicker feels like "You found a million dollars in your suitcase, and now you're on your way to the police department to turn it in."<br/><br/>I hope I don't sound all pedantic and nitpicky about this -- it seems like a critically-important difference to me, and something that's vitally important to address.  But that's just my opinion, of course -- if you and Peter are happy with the Kicker here, that's all that matters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293611/#Comment_293611" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T10:49:27+00:00" title="September 16, 2010 10:49AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get what you're saying.

Only unbound demons can be bound, and demons can only be bound to one sorcerer at a time.<br/><br/>However, demons can rebel and become unbound, so in my mind what's happening in that sort of scene mechanically is that Oghma is helping Leviathan rebel and then binding him again really really fast -- at least in theory.  If he blows that second roll, then Leviathan isn't bound by anyone and that's got to have its own story potential.<br/><br/>I sorta feel like this must have been clarified somewhere before -- the idea of one sorcerer stealing another's bound demon is just so Sorcerer-y that surely it's been addressed.

Somehow, there's an answering vibration, so he does it again.  Really not caring what this is - hoping, perhaps, for structural collapse, he continues to slam his fists into the dirt until they are raw and bleeding.  Then he notices bone under the bloody dirt, just like the bone showing through his bloodied knuckles.<br/><br/><img alt="image" height="150" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Pachycephalosaurus_skull.JPG" width="200"/><br/><br/>This is Tacitus, a tyrant and empire builder of a forgotten age.<br/><br/>In the next cell, a man laughs and laughs.

As yet, Yahnis keeps faith that one day the Damsel Messiah will come to Black Rock, lay waste to its perversion, and free him from his cell.  <br/><br/>Weeks later, out of interminable boredom, Yahnis decides to help Hamaan with his sorcerous training, and finally, Hamaan binds Tacitus.  A silent agreement exists between the two: Hamaan will build more than he ever lost, and Tacitus will see his fill of violence and dominance along the way.<br/><br/>More fights - the other gladiators know not to kill him, but do their best to abuse him, especially in groups.

The full-body markings of his tribe, stripes of black and white, are now stained red with his blood. The crowd cheers. The other fighters, watching from the cages, hang their heads low. Tacitus, heavy in my hand, shows me images of ancient beasts devouring a recent kill; the demon is pleased.<br/><br/>Nimrote stands on his pulpit, gesticulating. He is gloating again: something about the death a race, but his words are gibberish through the haze of my hate. What galls most is that he speaks truth: the boy and all that he knew, all that he represented, are now lost to history. The last of his tribe is gone. No one will ever wear those stripes again.<br/><br/>My tribe is gone, too. Sarah, my wife; Julia, my daughter; all the others. They were butchered in a hunt to capture... what? Me? To create another final survivor, another toy for Nimrote's games, another spectacle for those who would pay to watch men die.<br/><br/>No longer do I tend my meager fields in the twilight. No longer do I play games with my daughter, or tell her stories of ancient times when Marr'd was verdant and alive. No longer do I pray with my wife to the Ringed Lord, asking for health and happiness in our home.<br/><br/>Now, I fight.<br/><br/>I have fought for three years now. I have killed men, greys, primites, nines. I have ended the existence of a handful of species, but those were monstrous creatures from the wastes. This... this was a boy who once had a family. They prayed and toiled and played games of their own.<br/><br/>Deep inside of me, something breaks. A restraining wall, holding back the force of my hate, gives way. The rage washes over me like the legendary tidal wave, and I find myself moving towards the pulpit. With a strength and speed I did not I know possessed, I bound up the arena wall and hurl myself to where Nimrote continues to speak. He has only an instant to realize his peril. As I bring Tacitus down onto his skull, he doesn't even have time to scream.<br/><br/>Everything stops. The rage passes. The crowd is silent for moment. Then, from the cages, my name: "Hamaan!" Again, this time a different voice: "Hamaan!" A third time, multiple voices joining the call: "Hamaan!" My name becomes a chant, a war cry, as the fighters throw themselves against their cages. One breaks open, then another. Fighters stream into the arena. The spectators flee in panic.<br/><br/>Tacitus shows me more images, new ones that I haven't seen before. They are strange and hard to decipher, but I get the sense that the demon is laughing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294066/#Comment_294066" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T13:13:38+00:00" title="September 20, 2010  1:13PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty excellent all around.<br/><br/>Is this guy fighting with a literal skull in his hand, or does the demon take some sort of weaponized form?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294070/#Comment_294070" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-20T13:38:32+00:00" title="September 20, 2010  1:38PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a literal, fossilized skull.

Tall, dark and handsome.  Late 30's in age.<br/><br/>Ardra is a minor son in the Lemurian noble family of Quar of the region of Mu's Greaves.  Eschewing the corrupt machinations of Lemurian leadership, Ardra is the family hydrogogue.  He sets and enforces the region's baroque water-usage laws, a vocation that keeps him away from the capital and in regular contact with the people.  He is a charismatic man of action.  He often lets himself be drawn into solving problems that have little to do with hydrology.<br/><br/>He has a wife Gadara and a son Mahendra, both of whom he loves very much.<br/><br/><i>Background</i><br/><br/>Ardra is cousin to the family patriarch, the Witch-Lord Sherka.  Sherka is a Machiavellian figure of power in the Witch-King's court.  He is ruthless and corrupt.<br/><br/>Sherka and Ardra butt heads continuously over the treatment of the region's people and resources.  To say that they have strong ideological differences is an understatement.  Typical of his outlook, Sherka suspects Ardra of plotting to undermine him and seize control of the family (in fact, nothing could be further from Ardra's mind).  Ardra's son is the only male heir in the family's next generation, and therefore first in line to inherit the patriarchy from Sherka, who has yet to produce an heir of his own.  If anything should happen to Sherka, Ardra would become the de facto ruler until Mahendra became of age.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294314/#Comment_294314" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T14:09:59+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  2:09PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Ardra's Kicker</i><br/><br/>Sherka takes steps to control his troublesome cousin and prevent the coup that he's sure is coming.  He has Ardra's son Mahendra kidnapped and imprisoned in his home.  He informs Ardra that the boy's life depends on his continuing cooperation.<br/><br/>Ardra does not accept this new situation for a second.  He fights his way into the elder cousin's mansion and slays him.  But the subsequent search of the house reveals that his son is gone.  In fact, there is evidence of a break-in and armed struggle earlier that day.  As reason returns to his enraged mind, Ardra realizes that his son has been the victim of a second kidnapping in as many days.    This time, he has no idea who has taken his son or why.  And he, Ardra, has just killed the only people who could tell him who was responsible.<br/><br/>Ardra needs answers, but will soon be discovered at the scene of a great crime if he lingers at the mansion.  He cuts off Sherka's head, grabs his most prized book of sorcerous lore from the shelves of his inner sanctum, and returns home.  Sherka is now dead, and therefore a Demon.  Ardra Contacts and Summons Sherka and demands answers.  Sherka, as devious now as ever before, is unhelpful but willing to bargain.  It offers to help Ardra find and rescue his son if he will Bind it.  Furious, but seeing no other alternative, Ardra agrees.  The negotiations are long and convoluted, as would befit two wily political opponents.<br/><br/>Ardra is now a sorcerer, and Sherka is now his talking head in a sack.  To say that they have strong ideological differences is an understatement. <br/><br/><i>What Ardra Doesn't Know</i><br/><br/>Ardra is not Mahendra's father.<br/><br/>Shortly after her marriage to Ardra, Gadara was approached to become involved in a conspiracy to slay The Witch-King.  She was interested but Ardra forbade it, foreseeing great danger, much bloodshed, and uncertain benefits.  Gadara outwardly agreed to her husband's wishes but secretly remained involved with the conspirators.<br/><br/>The conspiracy to overthrow The Witch-King included his own daughter.  She and a coven of sorcerers Summoned a Succubus Demon to go to the Witch-King in fair female form, lay with him and steal his seed.  Then, in an orgiastic ritual of group sorcery, the Demon was to be transformed into male form and to impregnate the Witch-King's daughter with the stolen seed.  The scion thus conceived, without the Witch-King's knowledge, would be raised to be the champion who would eventually overthrow him.<br/><br/>But the conspiracy was discovered and the second ritual interrupted.  The Witch-King's daughter was prevented from fulfilling her role.  In that fluid moment of confusion, desperation and mass passion, Gadara laid with the Demon and conceived the scion.  Mahendra is a product of sorcery and the half-son of The Witch-King.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294486/#Comment_294486" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-23T22:36:20+00:00" title="September 23, 2010 10:36PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry, I just wanted to say that I am in love with this campaign and all these characters.

So here's an asterisk <br/><br/>*<br/><br/>That represents everything I missed between my last post and this one.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the middle of last night's session.  <br/><br/><i>Ardra</i><br/><br/>Ardra has thoroughly trashed his family.  He is gearing up (by summoning another demon) to head out over the sands after his son.  Via his demon's Hint power, Ardra now knows that the boy isn't even his - but keeps seeing Mahendra's face showing up in odd places, begging for help.  The house is massively in disarray and Ardra is trying to leave his sister-in-law, Agadda, in charge, since she wants to be.  Agadda tells Ardra that his son isn't really his, and rashly 1-die binds up her husband's green-ring demon.  <br/><br/>Before Ardra can leave, though, a Groom of the Witch-King arrives at the door, Guardian Mummy in tow.  (This is the same Guardian Mummy that trashed Sherka's house earlier).  The Groom, Adonis, is horribly and deliberately disfigured, with his face bisected and kept red and raw top to bottom and across the mouth.  Adonis is known as the Witch-King's 'fixer' - not so favored at court but sent on important missions.  His arrival, with Raksati (the mummified stepsister of the Witch King) is not a good sign. <br/><br/>Adonis makes to put his hand on Ardra's face, to push Ardra away, but Ardra stares him down. Ardra explains that he's the new Witch-Lord, but Agadda, Ardra's sister-in-law keeps interrupting. <br/><br/>Adonis asks about a seven-year-old child.  Ardra's wife Gadara shows a visible reaction, and Adonis makes to threaten her but Ardra positions himself directly behind Adonis, and loudly draws his own sword.<br/><br/>Agadda, Ardra, and Adonis try to talk cagily.  Adonis and Ardra decide to go outside.<br/><br/><i>Hamaan</i><br/><br/>After the battle, Hamaan enjoys the luxuries of Mara's reinvigorated embrace. Hamaan sees their relationship as an animal attraction that has simply maintained itself through the battle for freedom.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile Mara is reveling in being the Lady of Black Rock, organizing the women of the tower using her reflected power to the utmost.<br/><br/>To bind Black Rock, Hamaan's sacrifices another 'Last of its kind' (an androgynous bird-woman).<br/><br/>Hamaan says anyone who wants to go may go.  Few take him up on the offer, but the ones that do include Gibeon, a shaved Primite, who asks to take one of Nimrote's trophies (the head of the Proud, the huge old king of the Primites) to salve his shame.<br/><br/>An Atlantean nobleman, Aristeian (son of Aristeia, folks! See Uzal's backstory) who was a spectator before the riot, is also allowed to leave, but his disintegration rod is not returned to him.  Hamaan says he will get it back when he comes with rich Atlanteans who are there to spend.<br/><br/>A message from the Tsarina comes, revealing that Nimrote was one of the Tsarina's lovers.  After beating up the messenger a bit (the messenger called Hamaan weak for taking too long to choose his words) the messenger was sent back with a message that Nimrote was dead but Black Rock still would offer her hospitality.<br/><br/>When Penarch, another man who is the last of his kind, tries to leave, Hamaan first rides out to try to talk him out of it.  Penarch explains how his life has been hell in Black Rock, that he was born and bred to the pit and hates it, hates that his parents were killed.<br/><br/>Hamaan lets Penarch go while secretly arranging for Chimerae to attack them in animal form (Humanity Roll!)<br/><br/><i>Uzal</i><br/><br/>Spotting a marching army of some 400 men, Uzal met with Hemalu, the lowest-ranking Witch-Lord in Lemuria. Hemalu described himself as 'taking some fools for a walk.'  <br/><br/>Hemalu politely receives Hamaan in his tent, where they cannot be overheard by the army.  Hemalu's demon is a small female figure - Politesse, who appears dressed like an Atlantean noblewoman (since that's where Politesse finally died).  <br/><br/>Uzal instantly likes Hemalu, because Hemalu, like Oghma, does not recoil at Uzal's appearance.<br/><br/>When asked why he would take such a paltry force against Atlantis, Hemalu is brutally honest, saying that they were not sent to win, only to fight.  Uzal wonders what would bring a man to march to his death - In reply, Hemalu asks if Uzal has children. Uzal: "No." Hemalu:  "I do."<br/><br/>In exchange for a tunnel route past the Golden Pillars, Hemalu grants Uzal safe passage through Lemuria.  The symbol of safe passage is a Sarcor that caws out such a message.  The Sarcor is the Witch King's symbol.<br/><br/>When Uzal goes back to Leviathan and Three, Leviathan asks about the strength of the other demon, which Uzal rates as "not impressive."  Leviathan has a heated argument with Uzal - which escalates to a point of Punishment - over attacking the water carts of the army.  Uzal prevails, but opens one of his larger Hordling urns and dumps it out for the demon's benefit.<br/><br/>The following morning, something steps out of dawn's breaking light.  Walking out of the sun as if only a few feet away is a giant, some 15 feet tall, outlined in a bright halo but with only darkness within the form.  A voice asks "Are you my avatar?  Will you tell me of my son?"<br/><br/>This is a Nephilim; Nepth, son of Plut.  He is the father of Nimrote and came to Uzal because Uzal is bedecked in all the regalia of Plut (boatman, mummy wraps, tattered cloak, he even has a sarcor along for the ride!).<br/><br/>Oghma's condition has worsened to "At dawn roll a d6, if you roll a 6 you die today."  Uzal has been writing furiously to keep the Written Word appeased.<br/><br/>Nepth has the power to hold back the moment of death from Oghma.  In exchange, Uzal will find out why Nimrote died and what Nimrote's legacy is. Uzal is wary of going to black rock on his own, and Nepth points north, to Ardra's village, saying that he will find an ally there.  Nepth says there are three there - a hand with a green ring, a man with a foursquare face, and a father searching for his son.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296264/#Comment_296264" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T10:21:20+00:00" title="October  8, 2010 10:21AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other tidbits of how we've defined stuff in this game...<br/><br/>Rhinnoks - Short-legged domesticated rhinos, kind of look like a rhino with short piggily legs.  <br/><br/>Tkal walkers - Riding mosquitos with vestigial wings and eyestalks you can hold on to.<br/><br/>Mantischora - Enormous beetles whose giant wings can collect airborne moisture into a chitinous tank-pocket in their sides.

But now, as the land turns harsh and forbidding, there is but a shadow of the diversity that once was. Even those species that have somehow survived are dwindling in numbers, many to the point of extinction. If one wishes to find these remnants, there are two places to look: the Atlantean zoos, where creatures are held to be looked upon and pitied as they fade away, and Black Rock's dungeons, where they are given one last chance at glory and dignity, to end their lives in combat.<br/><br/>One such creature is known in the human tongue only as Noon, though his real name is complex and unpronouncable. An insectoid thing, Noon stands taller than a man, his shining carapace a deep emerald green. His many barbed and bladed limbs have led him to victory numerous times in the arena.<br/><br/>He takes no joy in his survival, however. Those who have died at his hands were the lucky ones. His pride and dignity prevent him from taking his own life, and sometimes, at night, you can hear Noon's chirping song echoing throughout Black Rock's dungeons, a lament for his lost loved ones whom he hopes to someday join.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299494/#Comment_299494" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T12:17:45+00:00" title="November  5, 2010 12:17PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really enjoy playing Noon.
