If you want to game with your friends, as opposed to making friends who game, you need to be able to share a game without necessarily making your friends read hundreds or even dozens of pages of rules.</p>\n<p>So rules that you can explain in a few minutes at the start of a session, or as the game progresses, are cool. But short rules that you can print out and hand to someone are even cooler! John Harper is great at short rules. Lady Blackbird's character sheets have all the rules on them. World of Dungeons (you should <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sage-kobold/dungeon-world-a-game-with-modern-rules-and-old-sch-0" rel="nofollow">go back the Dungeon World kickstarter</a> if you haven't seen this yet) has slightly longer rules, but you can still read them in less than 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Short rules might require someone (the GM or host I guess) to bring a bit more experience to the table to get things going. But games that someone can play 15 minutes after having heard of the game for the first time are good things. I wrote a short game for Stage One last year, and then I wrote an <a href="http://www.jklol.net/grace.html" rel="nofollow">even shorter game</a> this spring.</p>\n<p>Short rules require you to leave out all the rules that amount to "nobody be a dick at the table, we are friends and this is for fun". (Observe that, if playing pretend is the psychological [if not historical] genesis for the story gaming hobby, rules like stats and dice were made up in part to prevent people from being dicks.)</p>\n<p>This post is already too long, so I'll stop.

If you're just writing up enough of the rules so someone could play an introductory game, it's extremely short. (I've taught design classes where students have to figure out how to fit the rules to chess or cribbage onto a single letter-sized page folded in half into a pamphlet.) I really appreciate when RPGs are designed similarly \u2013 either as a super-simple system, or as a more complex system with "quick start" or "lite" rules. It makes it a lot easier for me to determine whether I want to read more, and it reduces the amount of prep time I'll need to put aside before I run a game for players who'll never bother reading the whole rule book.<br/><br/>Actually, I suspect that design homework project mentioned above would be a neat exercise for GMs and RPG designers. Can you fit the basic rules of your favorite (or your own) game onto pamphlet made from a single page? It really encourages you to approach your text economically. (Bonus points if you can fit a summary of the entire ruleset onto the back \u2013\xa0or the bottom half \u2013\xa0of the character sheet, Lady Blackbird-style.)<br/><br/>(Edit: Still trying to figure out how to format posts properly...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381565/#Comment_381565" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T00:53:25+00:00" title="June  9, 2012 12:53AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: silby</cite>Big expensive books are a part of the<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=646" rel="nofollow">oppressive social footprint</a>problem that RPGs have</blockquote>\nA lot of what you wrote is assuming your experience is correct and stating opinion as fact. The shorter the game, the more repetitive it can become. I say this from experience of playtesting games for others. There is a lot of overlap in design when simplifying rules, though that may be due to a type of thought process.<br/><br/>Overall, I think I understand what you are hinting at, but your message isn't clear. Short doesn't equal cool, crazy awesome, combo breaker. Short can generally mean less to memorize and less of a desire to continually play since it's fast to master/experience everything that's possible. Plus, the thought is sort of a fallacy since most of the big book games can be explained in 20 pages if you tell the actual rules, not the supplemental instructions that complete the idea (like magic in D&amp;D or house systems with Vampire: The Masquerade). I do it all the time with those Big Book games you claim are a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381566/#Comment_381566" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T01:04:33+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  1:04AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2012 1:06AM by Arpie.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, let's do this chess rules thing up really quickly;<br/>You will require: a board divided into 64 squares, eight on each side.<br/>Each player requires two complete set of pieces in distinctly different colors.<br/>Of these pieces, each player requires 8 pawns, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 2 knights, a queen and a king (16 pieces all together)<br/>Players sit facing each other and begin by arranging the pieces in the following pattern:<br/>Nearest row: Rooks on the outside of the row, Knights adjacent to Rooks in same row, Bishops adjacent to knights, Queen on corresponding color of board, King in last open space of row. The eight pawns are put on the row in front of the other pieces.<br/>Each turn, a player can make one of the following moves. Each move corresponds to a piece. If the move puts the piece on the same square as one of the other player's pieces, that piece is captured and removed from the board. The object is to maneuver your pieces so that the opponent cannot move his king without putting it in peril of being captured on your next move. If your king is in peril, you must immediately move any piece (including the king) in an attempt to prevent its capture.<br/>Otherwise, your move options are:<br/>Pawn: Move a space in a direct line toward the other side of the board.<br/>Pawn Capture: Pawns may only capture by moving diagonally a single space.<br/>King: The king may only move a single space at a time, in any direction.<br/>Bishop: Bishops may only move diagonally, but may move any number of spaces in any diagonal vector. Bishops must stop and capture any piece blocking their vector unless it is one of your own pieces (in which case the bishop just stops.)<br/>Rook: Rooks may only move orthagonally, but may move any number of space in any orthagonal vector. As with bishops, Rooks must stop and capture enemy pieces in the direct line they are moving in or just stop short of friendly pieces (or on a whim.)<br/>Queen: The queen can imitate any of the above maneuvers.<br/>Knight: The knight may move past any pieces, but must always move either 2 spaces in one direction and 3 spaces at a right angle to that or 3 spaces in one direction and then 2 spaces at right angle to that.<br/>Castling: once per game, when your king is in check, you may switch places with a rook and the king - but only if there are no pieces between the king and the rook and if the rook has not moved previously.<br/><br/>I think that's all. About a page, even if written more concisely. (And, as you can see from the typos, I did it from memory.)<br/>Yep. Pretty simple game.<br/>That's, what, about 20 actual moves (depending on how you break it down maybe 30 max) and some set-up information.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381568/#Comment_381568" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T01:45:52+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  1:45AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I agree that brevity is, in and of itself, a good thing. The less someone has to read, the better, unless there's something cool, interesting or useful that the extra text is conveying. But there's the thing, all your text should be cool, interesting and useful. Really the problem is that so many games include a lot of not-cool, not-interesting and not-useful stuff, or stuff which is only c/i/u to a limited subset of the audience but not structured to enable skipping bits.<br/><br/>For my money, what you need for every game is:<br/>(1) A quick start guide;<br/>(2) A printable one-page summary (or collection thereof) and/or reference;<br/>(3) A lot of effort put into structure and layout to facilitate rapidly finding the information you need; and<br/>(4) A similar amount of effort put into helping the reader navigate the book on first reading and skip the bits they don't need.<br/><br/>A good example is, I'm reading Hero Wars right now. I really like the game, and I think that every bit of it adds value, so I don't necessarily think it is too long per se. But all the parts are interrelated, with poor cross-referencing and failure to explain new terms when they are first mentioned, and absolutely no summaries or quick start guide. The result is that I need to read 250 pages of A5 before I can start to play. This despite the fact that the core mechanic is quite simple to explain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381578/#Comment_381578" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T04:03:24+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  4:03AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John Harper can write Lady Blackbird within a few pages.

It really evolved that way over a many hundreds of weird decisions such as making the queen move more than 1 space as a tribute to Queen Elizabeth, nailing down the 8x8 board (and making it not circular or other interesting shapes or sizes), no longer using dice to move the pieces, and so on. <br/><br/>Chess and perhaps other well-known classic games were broadly living and evolving things which are only codified in modern times, trimming out the life and turning them into the focus of intense professional study, competition, and prestige. They were specifically fine tuned to be competitively interesting, not for simplicity and approachability instead they reward mastery. <br/><br/>This makes them poor examples, if you want your games to live and evolve. <br/><br/><br/>That being said, simplicity is a useful goal to strive toward, but cognitive simplicity is not the same thing as page count. The tools I recommend are things like: network diagrams of the concepts of the game, not just the mechanics - for example, AW's MC principles and moves definitely should be in the diagram. Also estimated or even measured learning curves - how many of these nodes are required at each stage of mastery, for what player roles, and what are the opportunities and limitations at each stage. <br/><br/>Of course that doesn't measure the difficulties in shifting perspective and breaking assumptions. Unlearning that AW moves are not just using an Ability score check. This again, need not be at all mechanical. Imagine tying to explain Inspectres to a Khazak and a Brazilian who have no context for American Schlock Horror and its parodies. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381589/#Comment_381589" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T06:21:30+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  6:21AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2012 6:22AM by Evan_Torner.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read RPG books for pleasure.

And it's simpler to play and to learn than the first.<br/><br/>If you are trying to play chess after reading the rules on a single sheet, you will be frustrated: everyone will beat the shit out of you, you will not understand how, and you will leave the game in frustration. Most people really learn chess by playing with someone who teach them, or by reading long books, the single-page sheet is only a mnemonic aid.<br/><br/>Luckily, there are lot of people around that can teach you at least the first couple of things about chess. You can ask parents, friends, siblings, you will easily find someone who will teach you at least enough to play. And if you really don't know anyone, there are literally hundreds of books that teach chess at any level of complexity.  (and the fact that people buy them is proof enough that you need more than a single sheet of rules to play chess).<br/><br/>Indie RPGs have a couple of problems competing with chess: usually you have to learn the game from the text because it was published something like 5 minutes ago, and even if it's not new, there are something like 50 persons in the entire world that could teach you to play it. And if you don't explain how to play in the rulebook, there is no other book in existence that will.<br/><br/>So:<br/>- Simpler rules: good. Usually simpler rules make for a better game, it's easier to teach other people and to remember. You make less mistakes during the game. Ideally, you should be a able to fit them all in a single sheet, like chess.<br/>- Shorter explanations: not so good. The more you explain (if you do it well), the more people will understand how to play your game. The rulebook is not only a rules list, is a teaching text, too: it has to teach how to play (that is much more complicated than a list of rules)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381603/#Comment_381603" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T08:06:46+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  8:06AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            rules do not equal book, and vice versa<br/><br/>also, who's using the rules? for apocalypse world, the player really only needs to know the rules on their playbook+the basic moves+"when you make a move, roll 2d6+stat and interpret the result"+how to track harm. i'd call that two "pages" of rules total, maybe three if you play someone with a hardhold or a gang. the MC, however, needs to know a lot more rules.<br/><br/>so, to call out Graham for example, are there too many rules for you to play a character in AW? or to be the MC? because those aren't 1-to-1 with the length of the book.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>as a general principle, i find the quality of a game to have almost nothing to do with page count, personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/silby" title="silby"><img alt="silby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/silby">silby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381605/#Comment_381605" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T08:21:12+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  8:21AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I don't think that game quality necessarily correlates with page count.

The thing is, it's a 17 year old game and we've added how to make survival situations and Star Trek style technical challenges a component of the story.

Pretty simple game.</blockquote>\nWell, your definition of check and checkmate is somewhat suspect. "My king's not in peril of being captured because my opponent is too dumb to see that it could happen."  Better to define it in terms of pieces and their capabilities.  Also you describe the knight's move completely wrong. And the requirements for castling are more stringent than you describe. And you left out a bunch of stuff:<br/><br/>You don't describe pawn movement from their initial position, capturing en passant, the orientation of the board, pawn promotion, putting yourself in check (or the three valid ways to get out of check), how a draw may occur, how to record a game or the use of the clock.<br/><br/>The United States Chess Federation's official rules of chess are 416 pages long.  Now, the USCF is a competitive chess organization which is promoting tournament play, so it's different from playing at a cafe or with your pals on the weekend.

The closer you are to an infinite number of variations the easier it is to define the set of actions you have available. "You can do anything" borders on the infinite. "You can do anything you can describe" is pretty nearly there. More limits require more rules, which, in turn, slow down communication time.\n<blockquote>Actually you can be playing 4e D&amp;D after hearing about it for the first time in 15 minutes, since character creation is just arranging some numbers and picking a couple of options off a few lists, and the game doesn't even require you to do that.

Any game aimed at new players tends to do better with a shopping list.<br/><br/>PS. Sorry, Rabalias, I wasn't sure how to spell it and I was in a hurry.

If you've read it and played it, you know it couldn't be substantially shorter than it is and be even close to the same game. Obviously that was a deliberate choice. Long game texts turn some people off, but they intrigue some people too (probably less than they turn off), if the length is really warranted. Small games can be good, but oppressive social footprint games can be good, too. Just in the same way that games that are super easy to learn and play can be good, but games that are also difficult to engage with can be good, too. I mean, how easy is it to engage with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Barney" rel="nofollow">Matthew Barney</a>'s work?<br/><br/>I also totally recognize that the oppressive social footprint is <i>not</i> something that's always wanted, especially for newer or tentative players.

(I tried to search it - I think the term 'playset' came into being around then for this type of approach - but Van2 isn't playing ball.)<br/><br/>For instance, The Shadow of Yesterday is much longer than Lady Blackbird, but this doesn't mean that Clinton R Nixon is a less elegant writer than John Harper. Clinton birthed some new concepts, such as Keys, that required some unpacking. By Blackbird's day, keys had become part of the furniture, and so could be concisely referred to in the text without that unpacking - and if people didn't get it immediately, they could easily google around story games or locate the entirety of the TSOY text online. Heck, you could see the online TSOY text as containing Blackbird appendices, not essential for all, but available and very useful for some players!<br/><br/>Some games are going to be longer because they are trying to explain things that are outside of the current milieu. Whether a new mechanic, setting content, or a particular tone - Cthulhu Dark is perfectly designed to allow those who want to play Lovecraftesque horror to do so, but if I write a game based around a different type of little-known horror, I may find that more guidance would be useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381898/#Comment_381898" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T13:23:14+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  1:23PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Alex, the basic rules have been trimmed down the 36 pages.<br/><br/>You're comment on Mage Knight is exactly the sort of thing I'm talking about.

Very few have ever done something with quick player rules summary handouts, though some clever ones work that into excellent character sheet/booklet designs.</blockquote>\nThe important difference is that "how to play" -stuff in games like Poker is about tactics, when in RPGs...well, just general advice about how to make the game cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381971/#Comment_381971" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T20:33:54+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  8:33PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not just general advice.

The core rules instructions for Fiasco could really fit on about 10 pages, leaving the rest for playsets. The same is true for Do and many other relatively simple indie games. I agree with Graham that designing a long text is an intentional design decision, and one that's almost always a terrible one to choose unless you've already got a tight, working game that fits on a dozen pages and are now ready to flesh it out into a full rules text that explains how to play to a unfamiliar audience (which is partially what Fiasco and Do are attempting, I guess).

Is there a lot of data backing it up? In interviews, I've heard Vincent Baker say that he regrets making the rules for <i>In a Wicked Age</i> and <i>Poison'd</i> so short, and I certainly get the impression that people have a harder time playing those games than they do with Vincent's longer games. Personally, I prefer games that actually tell people how to play rather than leaning on whatever random combination of techniques they know from other games to fill in gaps in the design. I'm not saying it's <i>impossible</i> to write a game that's both thorough and concise, but it's not always possible and it's rarely easy. If a designer faces a tradeoff between thoroughness and concision, I'd rather they go down the path of explaining the game rather than appealing to people that hate to read. I agree that some games are so long that it becomes hard to absorb them (<i>Mouse Guard</i> and <i>DFRPG</i> spring immediately to mind), but brevity is not the sole virtue of a written work, so I don't understand why it's valued so highly by the community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382078/#Comment_382078" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T12:25:59+00:00" title="June 12, 2012 12:25PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The more I think about this, the more I'm beginning to disagree. Yes, I just wrote a 7 or 8 page RPG for a 24 hour challenge at 1km1kt and it works in playtest. And the rules themselves are probably a page or three, but I'll probably play it once or twice. On the other hand my 206 page book has the kind of really crunchy detail that I like in a game. Yes you can just narrate stuff into the game and I do that in some of my games but I always come back for the crunch.<br/><br/>Just my opinion, obviously people who like narrative heavy games will disagree saying that the more material in the book limits their creative freedom, but in my heart I love huge playsets, things like Legos, or a big box of Star Wars figures. You can tell really interesting stories with only a few Legos or one or two action figures, but I love having a big pile of them.<br/><br/>I guess the same goes for my RPGs. I recognize that you can do really cool things with less and in some ways you may be able to do more if the game is built right.

Not only does this mean I can potentially start within 15 minutes (or whatever) of picking the game up, but it also allows me to read the whole rest of the book with an overview of the system in my head already. I'm not opening new pages full of detail and going "huh?" because I can relate it to the intro.<br/><br/>One of the things I most value about the likes of Apocalypse World and Hero Wars is that they contain advice on how to play and GM. Roleplaying is not a monolith, so having a guide to how to play *this* game is useful. That probably means you need a bigger book. Doesn't mean you can't have a quickstart guide.

In other words, I worry that he's implicitly arguing that his games -- Apocalypse World specifically -- satisfy the rules of proper game design ethics, and he's doing so by abstractly, negatively, and very generally presenting the appeal process inherent in games.  Actually, I think that what he's giving us is a visual representation of our *sensation* of that appeal, which, since we are living in a modern world, is normally one of alienation and disconnect.  To pass that off as essential game design theory isn't exactly getting the point.<br/><br/>In short, why not produce whatever game (subject to editing, testing, and review, of course!) and let gamers decide?  In fact, why bother to negatively -- and separately from your actual game -- sketch out the alienation caused by your competitors' games in the first place, however succinctly you might do it?  (And Vincent Baker is certainly nothing if not succinct!)  Instead, choose you ethical parameters and simply follow them!  Then, dedicate a section of your own gaming resource to declaring your intentions in detail alongside your biases, as many of them as you were able to perceive.<br/><br/>To be sure, I make my own argument here with all due respect to Baker, whose games are wonderful in themselves, and who constantly declares his biases whenever he is confronted about them.  I just think we need to characterize the oppressive social footprint before we throw the term around like a piece of holy scripture.<br/><br/>For me, the oppressive social footprint mostly consists of combat.  You hit, you miss, they hit, they miss, and on, and on, and on, ad nauseum.  But I guess a lot of people love how crunchy the rules have gotten for such an activity as simulated fights.  Also, many designers have already pared combat down, or utterly taken it out, in such a way that it no longer constitutes such a comically recurring kidney stone that you simply must pass.  <br/><br/>The real problem, I think, is this: How do you provide fair expression, concisely or not, to as many of the essential experiences in your game as you can, then pare your game down so that is does *only that*?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ishaibarnoy" title="ishaibarnoy"><img alt="ishaibarnoy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/923/nBMVUZWQ7C7SB.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ishaibarnoy">ishaibarnoy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382091/#Comment_382091" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T14:11:44+00:00" title="June 12, 2012  2:11PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ugh, I sound so contentious in my last post.
