Ghost/Echo looks really cool, but I'm confused on how to play it.<br/><br/>It seems that you state your action (grabbing a Goal die), say what's dangerous about it (grabbing a Danger die), roll and compare the results to the relevant tables. What I'm confused on is two part:<br/><br/>1) Why would you want to add a second danger? It says you have the opportunity to add a danger. Usually if I "have the opportunity" to do something, it implies that it is something I would want to do. What benefits are there for adding a second danger?<br/><br/>2) How do you calculate the results when you get to add an extra Goal die?<br/><br/>I like the brevity of the document, but as with many of John Harper's games, it seems like he's trying harder to make it as short as possible than he is explaining the rules. Another page on this would have allowed him to clarify his thoughts better. Not a complaint, just an observation.<br/><br/>Thanks for any help clearing this up.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386988/#Comment_386988" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T11:43:06+00:00" title="August 13, 2012 11:43AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2012 11:45AM by MikeRiverso.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your confusion seems to be this: there are no specific "goal" or "danger" dice. There are just dice, and you get one for your goal, one for each danger, and one for being especially well-prepared. You only assign the dice to goals and dangers AFTER your roll. Having more dangers gives you more dice, and thus you have a better chance of rolling a high number, which you can then assign to your goal. Of course, you also have a better chance of having to deal with a danger coming true, since you have to assign a die to each danger, as well, so it's a trade-off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386990/#Comment_386990" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T11:46:57+00:00" title="August 13, 2012 11:46AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!<br/><br/>So, if you roll three dice, you pick which one goes to the goal and assign the others to the dangers?

So the more dangers, the worse off you are, but more likely to get a good result for the goal. Here's an example:<br/><br/>.COIL is fighting a wraith (in this example, wraiths are advanced cybernetic security drones) on a narrow catwalk in an abandoned factory. She charges the wraith, with the goal of throwing it off the walkway, down the floor below. That sounds like she's Committing to Violence, and the default danger is unwanted harm. Thus:\n<pre><code>Goal: Knock the wraith of the catwalk.<br/>Danger: .COIL falls off herself. (unwanted harm)</code></pre>\n.COIL's player takes two dice and rolls them. Let's say we get a 3 and 6. .COIL's player now makes a choice: either the wraith falls (Goal: 6) and the catwalk comes loose at one end, tilting perilously (Danger: 3), or she maintains her footing (Danger: 6) and the wraith is knocked over the railing, but still has a firm grip on it (Goal: 3).<br/><br/>An additional danger could also have been added. This particular wraith has many tentacled limbs, so perhaps the second danger is that one manages to grab .COIL's weapon:\n<pre><code>Goal: Knock the wraith of the catwalk.<br/>Danger: .COIL falls off herself. (unwanted harm)<br/>Danger: The wraith gets a hold of .COIL's shotgun.</code></pre>\nNow .COIL's player rolls three dice, and gets a 1, 3, and 6. Many choices available, but let's say that the wraith falls (Goal: 6), so does .COIL (Danger: 1), and the two combatants are now grappling for the weapon on the factory floor (Danger: 3).<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Note an important fact: the goal and dangers should all be independent of one another. It's important that the danger makes sense whether or not the goal came true, and vice versa. <br/><br/>And one last point: when I first played the game, I didn't realize that the suggested actions were supposed to be like Moves in Apocalypse World; that is, the only actions for which you should bother rolling. My group was making up other actions, with their own goals and dangers, as we went along. Stick to the suggested actions, and don't roll for anything else, if you want a tighter experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386995/#Comment_386995" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T12:28:24+00:00" title="August 13, 2012 12:28PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks or the example, makes it very easy to follow.<br/><br/>This system seems very simple.

That is, I roll a 1 and a 6, and assign the 1 to my goal, and the 6 to my danger, and seemingly nothing happens. I had a bit of trouble with this when I ran the game, and only when I thought about it afterwards did I realize that the key is to ensure that even when that "nothing happens" result comes up, make sure that something still happens. The rules state that the opportunity for the goal is now lost, so make sure to weave that into the fiction, thereby changing the situation and forcing the story to move forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387020/#Comment_387020" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T20:44:22+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  8:44PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, avoiding a danger isn't nothing happening.

That's a pretty dramatic set of events.<br/><br/>If you want to check out a great game that operates based on similar principles, check out Bliss Stage. In in, you can bring in new traits (rather than dangers) that give you more dice, but then you have to assign dice to those traits to prevent them from leading to problems. Plus, the more dice you roll, the more likely you are to max out your "bliss," which pushes you towards the endgame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387021/#Comment_387021" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T21:01:48+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  9:01PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll check that out, thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387027/#Comment_387027" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T21:58:09+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  9:58PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you like games with a built in 'timer', Lacuna's maximum heart rate is another fun game mechanic.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
