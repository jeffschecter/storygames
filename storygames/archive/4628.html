That would certain push the paranoia aspect and keep the game dark, but will it remove any instance of reaffirmation of humanity scenes that my previous refreshes would have provided? I think it will. So, if it were to act as an addition to the normal kind of refreshes, would it get used? Should I set up specific ways to call on this Debriefing? Maybe I should use it for another part of the game entirely ....                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104606/#Comment_104606" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T11:14:41+00:00" title="October 24, 2007 11:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Debriefing, in these sorts of stories, is usually a conflict in itself: there's often a mole in the agency, so you have to be careful what you say; odds are, you were also up to shenanigans during the mission, so your bosses will want information out of you.  I could totally see a debriefing or interrogation working through BDTP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104608/#Comment_104608" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T11:18:53+00:00" title="October 24, 2007 11:18AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, BDTP = Being Debriefed Through Pain<br/><br/>Do you think, then, it wouldn't work well as written?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
