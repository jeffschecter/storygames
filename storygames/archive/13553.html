I for one have found them quite fun. <br/><br/>The game is pretty much entirely scripted. Each player is given a booklet, broken into chapters. In it you'll find what questions to ask and what answers to give. The order of interventions within a chapter doesn't matter, as long as they are all made before we move on to the next  chapter. <br/><br/>The fun is in getting in character, dressing up (makes for neat group pictures too) and playing the part of the suspect you play, and trying to solve the mystery. It's like being in an Agatha Christie novel.<br/><br/>I've played Long Live the King too. Once. It was very, very fun. I was the king. I think it would have been more fun to be a courtier. And the Bastard Prince won far too easily. I'm not sure whether the game is imbalanced or whether the player was simply very skilled. Though I believe a Murder Mystery would be enjoyable, especially with non-gamers, I think LLtK might be moreso.<br/><br/>Werewolf games tend to be much shorter. The game will be part of the evening, rather that the point of the evening, as it would be in the former case.<br/><br/>There are lots of enjoyable party games out there as well. Divide the guests in teams and play pictionary, hangman, charades... Or just play Cranium.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306691/#Comment_306691" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T14:38:44+00:00" title="January  3, 2011  2:38PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2011 2:39PM by Brian_Minter.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the groups in question was somewhat drunk by the time we got around to it, so it would have failed miserably.
