<p>It's been better than a month since our last session, but yesterday's session still rocked.</p>
<p>Mark's character, Eva, and her newfound lover Grisha had crash landed their airship on a small flying island while trying to avoid the civil war that was erupting on the central island of Alderoo.  There the two were picked up by the native gelflings of the island who, when they saw Emerelle's necklace (Lisa's character) promptly mistook Eva to be the Fey'Ri princess that they'd been waiting to return for generations.</p>
<p>A pivotal moment for Eva came when the gelfling highpriestess asked her quite directly "Are you a Fey'Ri?".  Pivotal, because Eva chose to use her ability to summon the help of a chamelion spirit to make herself look exactly like Emerelle despite the fact that Grisha was standing right there.  Having been raised in a culture that believes that all winged people are bad, and Fey'Ri are downright evil, Grisa freaked out.  Passed out cold.</p>
<p>Later on we had this wonderfully awesome Bringing Down the Pain conflict where Eva was trying to win Grisha back while Grisha was trying to bash Eva's brains out of her skull.  Mark's dice totally hated him during that conflict.  But he was so determined.  At one point, Mark had checked every Bruised and Bloodied box on Eva's sheet and hadn't yet even scratched Grisha.  Despite the obvious loosing streak, Mark decided to press onward.  Remarkably he won that round.  And I folded.  It was awesome.  Eva begged and pleaded and professed her love while Grisha kept trying to destroy her.  Eventually, after beating the living crap out of her, Grisha just couldn't take it any more and decided to carry her mangled body back to the gelflings for help.</p>
<p>Bringing Down the Pain is a wonderful mechanism.  But I'm glad that the threads about Giving (in relation to DitV) had been going around recently.  Giving up to Mark at that particular moment in time was killer awesome.</p>
<p>Any thoughts, Mark?</p>

                            Man, work has been busy.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>It's been better than a month since our last session, but yesterday's session still rocked.</blockquote>
This is important. I came to the table having caught up on the <a href="http://www.sonsofkryos.com/" rel="nofollow">Sons of Kryos</a> podcasts. I mentioned the section on coming back to a game after a long period of time and how to handle it from Episode 27. Everyone agreed to let me reiterate as much as I could remember and use that as a starting guide. What I remember of what I told them was:
<blockquote>We need to go over where we are, possibly moving time forward to help associate the time we've missed. We need to make sure we know what we want to do with our characters and stories so that we're on the same page and not rehashing old goals. Be sure that we're still playing what we want to play.</blockquote>
We recapped to the point that everyone felt comfortable with the story in their minds. These were our mental notes, as opposed to a standard set of GM's notes. As it turned out, we weren't in the middle of anything. We'd actually completed a story arc and bought off some Keys (and bought some new ones). We knew where we were and where we wanted to go:<br/><br/>I, as Eva, had stolen our airship and flown away with Grisha. Having been shot down, we were stranded on an island. We knew that the island had gelphlings an nothing else.<br/><br/>I was unsure with where I wanted to go at this point, and struggled until Eric came up with a cool situation: The gelphlings on the island knew about the necklace I carried (being the most valuable thing on the ship, which I didn't want to leave behind). [The necklace was Lisa's character's necklace and it indicated her birthright as heir to the throne of Alderoo.] Anyway, once I realized that my major story arc of being shy and unable to act on my own due to no confidence had been completed, I knew that I had to take bold, reckless action.<br/><br/>Special note: Don't get rid of your old Keys! They help you as much as the Keys that are still paying out, sometimes.<br/><br/>Lisa's character, Elmerelle had gotten her revenge and overthrown the insurgent human goverment of Alderoo. She now needed the necklace back to begin the rest of her quest to recover her throne. Much happened here, just trying to get a fix on where I was (but actually on the behalf on another player's story). What happened here (and in my part) were more significant opponents, and some Bringin' Down the Pain.<br/><br/>Special note: BDtP is where the game is at. It's weird, but you sometimes have to find a way to <b>lose</b> to someone before you can really rock their world. But who wants to win all the time, anyway?

I'll admit, I'd forgotten about people being afraid of fey'ri. But it worked towards my reckless confidence so I ran with it. What I was trying to do was guarantee that I wouldn't be exiled or slain, and it worked pretty well. I'm glad I had a chance to really think about what I wanted from my story before we started, though, or I'm sure I would have gone back to old ways and been meek.

My character is built for BDtP, come to think of it. I have reverse flags. All of the conflicts that I want (and want to lose at), I've purposely not spent Advances on buying the appropriate Ability. Even during the middle of the BDtP, where I had gotten a full Advance for suffering for my love, I spent on Scrapping instead of Sway or Deceit just so I could beat the love back in to Grisha. I'm sure I was utterly gleaming as I was told I was laying utterly broken in a giant stump hole.

I'm glad you gave, too. It was just the right moment, I think. I had to decide whether or not loving him was worth it (because of the coolness of Keys, sometimes character goals and metagame goals mesh).<br/><br/>By the way, you didn't mention our discussion of Key Scenes. I'd asked what would happen if I bought off all of my Keys and spent the Advances on non-Keys and you reminded me of Key Scenes.<br/><br/>See, everybody else, we don't play with these kinds of Scenes in mind. But, with a stroke of possible coolness, I said, "Why don't we just do what PTA does and let us tell you what kind of scenes we want to see upcoming? Then those can be Key Scenes and help you with the game."<br/><br/>We'll see if it works out next time. But I hope it's as cool as it sounds.                        </div>

<p>The whole Key Scenes thing just didn't click with me when we first started playing.  I just didn't know how to handle them.  The only things I could immediately think of were really railroady, so naturally I shunned away.  But in that session, right there when we had that discussion about selling off all your Keys, something occurred to me.  It occurred to me that I naturally have all these ideas in my head for cool scenes that may or may not happen.  And I naturally tend to try to lead the game in the direction of those cool scenes.  Like visiting the vast foggy lake of FeyRi turned to stone.  It was in my head before we started playing and you took my lead and went right for it.  So... then I give you XP because you followed that lead?  Awesome!</p>
<p>So, now, it's like I have permission to come up with a handful of scenes I really want to see happen and try to lead you to them.  And if you get there I toss a couple of XP your way.  Win-Win.</p>

                            It just seems natural then to explore compels or fork discussions in terms of rewards. Compels comes from FATE, where you get your currency by going with what the GM wants (which is determined by the player chosen Aspects). Fork discussions would be situations where you would step back from scene framing and determine which way to go. You could use a bidding system of currency to determine which was more valuable or important.                        </div>

                            No, I meant that that was where the discussion would continue in my mind. I wouldn't want to do this without hashing it out and starting something intentionally meant to explore it.                        </div>

<p>Totally.  Try bolting that onto your next design.  Although, I think the Fork thing smells a bit too much like pachouli for me.  At least, as a codified mechanism it does.</p>
