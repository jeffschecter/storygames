All of the Baum stories are, but only the first two Ruth Plumley Thompson books are. Starting with The Cowardly Lion of Oz, in 1923, the remainder of the books are still under copyright. The "Famous Forty", considered by most to be the "canonical Oz" (sort of a weird thing to suggest given how surreal Oz is) includes 24 novels that are still under copyright. The property passed on after Thompson to John R. Neill, then to a series of other Reilly &amp; Lee authors. The last was in 1963, Merry Go Round In Oz.<br/><br/>I should also note that MGM is very, very litigious about The Wizard of Oz, making adaptations very careful about rooting themselves in Baum rather than in the movie, which can be a bit tiresome to document thoroughly. So actually filing off the serial numbers makes good sense to me, a GODDAMN OZ FANATIC, um, in case you couldn't tell.<br/><br/>H.M.

I do feel a certain disease with the setting, though, and it's the same thing I feel about <i>Seven Skies</i>: the setting is just patently an RPG setting where a whole bunch of Stuff Gamers Like has been crammed into a map, without a whole lot of internal logic and with a fair amount of authorial fiat added to keep you from messing with it.  <br/><br/>It's not a content thing, because the settings described in both books are, indeed, full of neat stuff that this gamer likes; just the way it's all put together doesn't sit well with me.

It suffers from the issue that Danny discusses (disparate and unwoven elements thrown into a sink because gamers like them), but also from the issue that every region and culture is shallow (which annoys me because it's unrich, but also because it leaves me uneasy when an author says "people from this country or region are basically the same, characterized by X and liking Y.")<br/><br/>PDQ isn't an amazing system for fairy tales. Round-based conflict resolution where people invoke the same traits in the same basic way every time (a symptom of PDQ play I've seen every time I've ran it or observed it) doesn't support any part of the genre. Hero Points and "Magic has a Price" do not a fairy tale make, and it's disappointing to see a lengthy discussion about what makes a fairy tale, followed by a system that does little to support fairy tale creation.<br/><br/>The price point is really high, and I am not sure why. The lengthy discussion about what makes a fairy tale isn't particularly original or deep - I could have found that information on Wikipedia or by talking to any of my friends who enjoy fairy tales. The system is not sufficiently modified from core PDQ to have me consider it a new game; this is exacerbated by the fact that I think the way Dead Inside works would be better for fairy tales than the way ZoZ works, by and large. Finally, the campaign documentation constitutes half the book (or, like, however much of the book it constitutes) and that's not worth half of $30 (which, for those following along at home, is $15). The art feels clip-arty and I don't feel it adds to the book.<br/><br/>Basically, I felt like this was a bait-and-switch. I was promised a new game that got to the heart of fairy tales, and I got campaign notes.<br/><br/>If Chad had marketed it as "Zorcerer of Zo: How I took my favourite system, hacked it, and ran a ground-up campaign with it" and sold it for $13, I would have been really excited about it <i>before and after</i> reading. That kind of information is really useful - I just had a hard time finding it useful in the context I found it in - amidst a product that disappointed me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219455/#Comment_219455" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-19T13:08:40+00:00" title="July 19, 2009  1:08PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And as for everything else,<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9835&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">pre-order Ribbon Drive.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219791/#Comment_219791" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T09:05:49+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  9:05AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Thanks for the back-up, Ben, but I have put thought into why I don't like ZoZ and am happy to talk about it.<br/><br/>Basically, I felt like this was a bait-and-switch.
