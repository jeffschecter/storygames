                    This is a long rambling Actual Play with a GM's thoughts interspersed. As he says:<br/><br/><code>... some people seem to have the impression that I'm a pretty good GM. I (foolishly no doubt) offered to post a thread that would give an overview of my current (and about to be over) Eberron campaign wherein I would discuss some of the GM techniques and decisions that I made.</code><br/><br/>I'm reading it now, and I think it's neat.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.enworld.org/showthread.php?p=2825059#post2825059" rel="nofollow">Dissection of a Campaign - GM Commentary</a> </div>

                            Thanks for this link, Mark.  It's a treat to see indie techiques (scene framing, rewards driving play, accounting for creative agendas, explicit group contracts, etc.) being imported into a very traditional system.  And I got a very PTA-ish vibe from their use of "DVD extras" to describe the little scenes that could be done in email.<br/>
<br/>
It's also interesting to see them rejecting the stuff that doesn't work for them -- the rejection of kickers as unscalable, for instance.                        </div>

                            I can't tell offhand if these are techniques which Rel learned from indie games and imported, or techniques learned from traditional gaming.  Mark, do you know?  <br/>
<br/>
The GM Rel does use some explicit theory terms which is from Robin Laws of Good Gamemastering (i.e. dividing his players in to "Butt Kicker", "Storyteller", "Power Gamer", and so forth.)  I don't quite catch the reference about kickers as unscalable, but I haven't read the whole thread thoroughly.  Which part does that refer to?                        </div>

                            It's probably wrong of me to say these techniques are being "imported" since, as you say, their provinence is kinda unclear.  <br/><br/>Much of it appears to be coming from the DMG2 -- it looks as though the Robin Laws Good Gamemastering stuff, or a variation, appears in there.  <br/><br/>"Used" is probably a better term, rather than "imported."

Rel's 01-06-06 09:26 PM post, reacting to LostSoul's "dead hooker in the bathroom" scenario.  They don't call 'em kickers as such, though.                        </div>

                            Scott (Rel) has told me that he's pretty much done everything through experience (and by both his online admission, and to me personally) through some guidance from Laws' book. The DMG II (which he states on the thread he's been using) also has lots of work done by Laws'. I've only been lucky enough to play in one shot games with him, but his design structure is magnificent. From what he's said, he's a tactician at heart.                        </div>
