I'm pulling in a mix of people, a mix of ages, and while I'm getting a mix of styles, everyone is conversant enough in what they like to know that they legitimately want to play my game.  I run a game where we play to find out what happens and there aren't very many rules.<br/><br/>I've got their character sheets, with a how they deal with problems, relationships with at least 3 NPCs, how they relate to other player characters, and how they are likely to get themselves into trouble.  So a pretty good starting point.  Now, given that I have all this, what should I do to delight my players?<br/><br/>Another way of putting it: <br/><br/><b>How do I go from a good R-map, meaty character descriptions, and some color, to delighting my players?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349587/#Comment_349587" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T19:40:53+00:00" title="November 23, 2011  7:40PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't really answer without knowing what your game is?

The Truths is a short list of things that we will know to be true. e.g. Since TDoV is a game of Shakespearean comedy, one of the truths is that it ends with a wedding. When setting up a game the facilitator/player with the most dramatic voice reads the Truths aloud so that everyone at the table gets to hear them.<br/><br/>The truths will get everyone on the same track.   Shared expectations, and shared joy from seeing the game progress in the expected direction will make your players delighted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349616/#Comment_349616" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-24T10:39:40+00:00" title="November 24, 2011 10:39AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some context: We play to find out, there aren't many rules (GHOST/ECHO dice variant), and setting and sitch are closest to Perdido Street station.

So start with a simple impossible situation: the authorities have trapped everyone in a building and they're searching it for a dangerous fugitive.  The fugitive doesn't exist.  Whatever they decide to try works.  <br/><br/>After that, proceed to different impossible situations and you'll be good to go.<br/><br/>The initial delight is one of introduction - aha, this is why I'm here!
