The players are all invested in both their characters and the setting/npcs (more than just about any other game we've played).  However, we often only roll for conflicts maybe 2 or 3 times each session (although a few sessions we've rolled more often).  The characters are all engaged with conflicts but I'm finding that it often comes down to roleplaying and not rolling dice.  We reach for the dice when we find there is something pressing that needs to be resolved. but sometimes that isn't very often.  It isn't like we're just sword shopping or something for ages with nothing happening.  I'm hitting them with bangs I've devised that push the narrative along in interesting ways almost every scene--yet we're not rolling the dice very often.<br/><br/>So. . .is this even a problem?  <br/><br/>AND<br/><br/>How might we push toward the dice more often?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383591/#Comment_383591" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T12:36:29+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 12:36PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Today, I'll play the role of the newbie who says the obvious thing so smarter people who play more games can follow up with more intelligent responses.

I went back to the dice after playing Amber Diceless on and off for about ten years.  I don't want to get into a discussion of the strengths and merits of Amber Diceless as we're playing FATE using our own version of the Amber setting.  And FATE uses dice! <br/><br/>I want the dice to decide conflicts.  But now, perhaps ironically, I find us drifting away from the dice.  Maybe we've found our happy medium though: use dice but not as often?  Maybe I am making a mistake by trying to push for more rolls when we don't need to.

And my final question was not just rhetorical: What would you gain by rolling more often? Do you feel it would add more tension in the fear of failure, or perhaps more drama in dealing with the complications resulting from failure? Do you feel that having degrees of success or failure implied by dice would give the GM more inspiration in narrating the results of actions? Or would it be much like what you're doing now, but with successful dice rolls validating (more often than not) what you're planning on doing anyway through simple roleplaying?<br/><br/>There are certainly some benefits to having dice color what happens in a scene, but I'd personally worry that actively trying to encourage more rolling would simply distract more from what may already be a "happy medium." If you'd like the chance of failure to inject more tension and drama, though, I wonder whether the solution might be to present the players with more challenges that beg for dice, rather than to require rolls for the stuff you're already doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383641/#Comment_383641" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T17:24:36+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  5:24PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2012 5:25PM by Kropotkin.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JasonT wrote:\n<blockquote>If you'd like the chance of failure to inject more tension and drama, though, I wonder whether the solution might be to present the players with more challenges that beg for dice, rather than to require rolls for the stuff you're already doing. </blockquote>\nThat may indeed be what's going on here.  We've got lots of drama happening but the sort of drama that's been unfolding feels more natural to "just roleplay" what happens rather than stop and call for a die roll.  I think that I am looking for more sorts of challenges that require rolling.  It hadn't occured to me that the TYPE of challenges being offered might be why were doing this.  Most of what's been going on is SOCIAL conflict and while we do make some social conflict rolls it does seem like we're happy to just let some of the scenes play out without rolling.<br/><br/>Conflicts involving magic and swordfighting seem to have fallen by the wayside a little and maybe that's what I'd like to bring in a little more.  Not that anyone's been complaining as they all keep telling me they're really enjoying the way the game is going.  This may just be me and my GM brain looking for problems where there aren't any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383642/#Comment_383642" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T17:36:54+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  5:36PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2012 5:37PM by Kropotkin.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Onix,<br/><br/>I don't agree as we're quite happily using FATE.

None of my previous campaigns have been as electric as this one.

I didn't mean that you shouldn't use FATE, I meant that many have commented that when they take the Amber system and try to apply it to other games it doesn't work. It does work for Amber though. I was then postulating that it's possible that the setting naturally leads to conflicts that can be handled without dice.<br/><br/>The reason I say this is to suggest that perhaps you are experiencing a natural result of a setting that was designed to not need a randomizer.

My concerns stem from the fact I wasn't sure if we were interfacing with the FATE mechanics enough.  There is something about Amber that seems to be so heavily character focused that mechanics seem to become less important.<br/><br/>Maybe that's contributing to our playstyle in this game.

And that's how Amber should be when nothing much is happening. But of course the Amber novels are all about people poisoning each other and stabbing each other in order to gain Real Ultimate Power. I would have some asshole try to ally with the characters for his magnificent plan, and whether they do or they don't, a shitload of assassins and stuff chases them across time.

They ARE conflicting and double dealing with each other, but it just isn't happening as much as I'd like.  There was one session where they dealt with this massive army that was massing in Avalon against Amber, and they set about killing the leaders of this army in typically ruthless fashion.  We had lots of rolling that session (ironically they found out later this army was established by Oberon who's gone missing).  However, I'm going to try to have the knives come out more in future sessions.  <br/><br/>There's lots of questions about what the hell is going on and even as questions are being answered every game-new questions come up.  I think it's been a combination of these questions, intrigue (without the knives), and exploration which have sustained us in those sessions where conflict has been light.<br/><br/>Time for the knives now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
