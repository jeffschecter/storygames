We were aboard a science vessel exploring a planet inhabited by a possibly sentient race.  Of course they were hostile, and for several sessions, we were trying to take back the parts of our vessel that were boarded and escape with as many of the other survivors as we could (the science vessel was big, like Star Trek "Enterprise" sized).  <br/><br/>My character was based around "A Japanese-style" businessman who was on the vessel as a representative of the corporation he worked for, which was also based on Japanese business.<br/><br/>Near the end of the campaign arc, we had returned back to human controlled space. We were immediately greeted by an abrasive military fleet that spooked all of us. The GM did a risky maneuver by letting the party split itself up.  I took an experimental shuttle with a jump drive and jumped to another part of space by myself, despite other players wanting to come with me (The GM explained there was only enough food for one person).  After the rest of the players docked with the military fleet, Collyn had Markus sneak away.  Our third player went to work with the scientists aboard the military fleet, and our fourth player is kind of a passive guy, so his character just went to his new quarters.  <br/><br/>Nathan does a scene with just Collyn: <br/>At this point, Collyn decided that we better blow up the Vortex gate (a wormhole of ancient alien creation) to keep the aliens from finding humanity.  At this point, all of us were on board with blowing up the Vortex gate. He had Markus sneak back aboard the Exploration Vessel through a series of Charm and Stealth rolls, then get to the ship's computer core that he had already had taken control of during the other sessions. At this point, he vented atmosphere from every other room to "encourage" the military off the ship. Then he remotely undocked the ship and flew it into the Vortex Gate while setting the ship's reactor to overload and running to an escape pod.  Nathan also mentioned there's still about 10 military personnel left on the ship who had space suits on and were not going to be able to escape in time.   <br/><br/>However, because Collyn had failed several rolls and kept going, the military was very aware that Markus was the one to steal the ship and blow up the gate.  At this point, they have nothing but our word that there are evil aliens out there.  Markus is branded a terrorist, and only escapes because his escape pod was picked up by some privateers. (Nathan decided to roll a d100 for 95+ being favorable to Markus. He rolled a 97.) <br/><br/>At this point, I suggest that Markus is basically a legend, but I don't feel he's really a playable character anymore (as he is now a fugitive and the campaign started with us being scientist do-gooders) and maybe should be retired.  Collyn had also been itching to play a new character type (a psychic). Nathan, the GM, is excited that Collyn is having a ton of fun, and says he should keep playing Markus.  Collyn also wants to keep playing Markus.  Our third player sees herself as a hostage of the military (she isn't really but has been hyped up by Markus's daring adventure) and our fourth... doesn't really have an opinion.  At this point, really it's just me and Collyn at odds here, as I cannot see Tohya giving up his corporate prestige and lifestyle to go "on the run" with Markus.   <br/><br/>So now, I'm coming in with a new character for this (seems like a new campaign to me). My old character, Tohya, goes off and receives his rewards from his Corpration for finding out so much information.  The ship hijacking and vortex gate explosion probably the biggest effect I've seen a character have on a campaign, but it's also the only time I've had another player take my character's agency away (by forcing me to become a fugitive or retire the character).  <br/><br/>We're all pretty open to talking about the "metagame," so luckily we could just talk with each other about what was happening and what that means.  Nathan admitted he made a mistake by having such a big scene happen with only 1 player.  But I do feel like I got the short end of the stick, as I had enjoyed the personality and RP I had developed for my character, which is usually pretty hard for me to get into.  <br/><br/>Have you ever had to retire a character before for a reason like this?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445198/#Comment_445198" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-12T04:15:41+00:00" title="May 12, 2015  4:15AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great story/question. I've been in several circumstances where I had to "back up the car" and really re-think what my character's targets/role in a group was going to be, and I can imagine a situation like this one where I just can't go far enough and still be interested in what I come up with, necessitating a character change.<br/><br/>I always like inverting these scenarios. One guy makes a bold flourish, a dramatic choice all will remember, and turns the campaign in a whole new direction nobody, including him, could ever have anticipated. Isn't this an unalloyed positive thing?  Well, maybe not, given the needs of everyone else at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445207/#Comment_445207" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-12T15:15:38+00:00" title="May 12, 2015  3:15PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Albeit not exactly the same issue, a friend of mine who is a powergamer is somewhat used to retire his characters when they start breaking the setting and making the GM's work too difficult; of course, talking things first with everyone. <br/><br/>I'd call separating the party not exactly a bad move, but a totally different game: one that (more or less) requires players to be open to play a whole set of characters and where the things that should be respected more are the original premise and the main storyline, which shouldn't be focused in characters, but in the line of events that the players will influence with their choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445209/#Comment_445209" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-12T17:41:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2015  5:41PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I agree that this was "another player taking your agency away" at all.<br/><br/>The way I read this, the player did something world-shaking.  That's not taking away your agency.<br/>Then the whole group (except you?) decided "You know, rather than play scientist do-gooders, let's play fugitives." - essentially, as you yourself noted, pretty much starting a new game with some of the same characters.<br/><br/>I don't feel like anyone's agency was removed, but rather that the game ended and restarted with a different choice of characters.<br/><br/>And even though the world-shaking-event was one player's doing, it was the whole group that made the game change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidC" title="DavidC"><img alt="DavidC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidC">DavidC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445211/#Comment_445211" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-12T23:46:44+00:00" title="May 12, 2015 11:46PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The world-shaking bit wasn't what took away my agency.  What did happen was that Collyn was offered several ways to stay true to the overall tone of the game.  The GM offered that his character make a false identity, but Collyn felt his character was proud of what he had done and would never "hide his identity" (even though that means being on the run). Since Collyn was looking at a new character class (Psychic) and the GM was planning on doing some indeterminate hand-waving in the future, I recommended he retire and bring in a Psychic, which Collyn wasn't opposed to... but the GM discouraged that plan.<br/><br/>Something that I didn't mention is that we had already played a 3 hour session (cut short because it was going nowhere and the other two players were literally falling asleep) after the session where everything big had gone down.  That session was "brainstorming" on how to rescue Nikita (the scientist played by the lady in our group).  Over that session, I resisted heavily going through with some of the plans, and it occurred to me that every plan involved killing a lot of innocent people and that we weren't really sure that she was actually a hostage or in any danger.  The military had said they were taking her to the galactic council to hear what she witnessed (perfectly reasonable, and getting to the council to warn them of the aliens was our group's main goal).  The only reasons we disliked the military was a very rude Admiral, in a classic gruff military way, and a vague threat that one of the aliens had managed to stay on our ship and then infiltrate the military ship.  I should mention that Nikita's main involvement in the game is the Captain and Chief Scientist of the exploration vessel.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm not upset with retiring Tohya, I feel he was an epic character and I feel it's always best to go out on a high note (which for him, was obtaining the experimental jump drive for his corporation).  It is rare when I can get into a character's head that is so outside my own personality, so it's kind of disappointing to lose that part. I also have a vague worry that the campaign will devolve to running away from the law until we get bored of that, since so far, we have no real story to propel us forward.  <br/><br/>Ironically, the GM asked me to bring in a psychic character (a NPC he introduced us to before, that would make sense to become a PC).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445212/#Comment_445212" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-13T01:39:18+00:00" title="May 13, 2015  1:39AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an alternate world where Collyn did make that compromise, didn't he come here to story-games and post a thread with the exact same title?
