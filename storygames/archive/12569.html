The spotlight guy is at the beach. Two players can't make it the next week. The show reluctantly goes on hiatus until the fall. PTA is a game that really requires everybody to be there every time you play. It suffers if even one player is missing. This isn't a knock on PTA, it is just a thing - I'd say the majority of games have a low tolerance for chaos.<br/><br/>So what games have a <i>high</i> tolerance for chaos? What games keep rolling when you are down a player, when some dude shows up halfway through, when you suddenly have four hours or realize you only have 90 minutes this week?<br/><br/>I think any single-session game does, and to some degree the busy lives of my friends have guided my own design sensibilities in this direction. But I'm interested in extended play here.<br/><br/>3:16 does, but sadly it gets played primarily as a one-shot.<br/><br/>What else?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282302/#Comment_282302" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T05:19:26+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  5:19AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anything where you have free reign in the game for characters to appear/disappear with alarming suddenness, even when in the middle of an adventure.

I've already seen two such games fold due to "chaos", and it seems that the remaining players weren't interested in continuing without everyone present. <br/><br/>From where I'm sitting: I've designed a couple of "story-telling" games, which do this quite well, because each session is self-contained and satisfying, but can be tied into the previous and following "story" as much as the players present wish to. They're also easy to adjust for time (duration of session). Since anyone can narrate for anyone's character, there's no problem with people dropping out halfway through or other issues with character ownership. The only real problems are that a) all the designs I could come up with require at least three players and b) are competitive in nature, meaning that someone joining in halfway through cannot be "balanced" in respect to other players (although taking over another player's resources works really well).<br/><br/>I've never played it, but I bet Universalis would be a good candidate for this sort of thing (unless the rules are too dense for your group to pick up and play, which is a possibility).<br/><br/>So, some factors that limit games from being "chaos-independent" (brainstorming here, not an essay--please add to it, or say what you disagree with):<br/><br/>* The reward of play is not achieved within a single session (several sessions are required to .<br/>* The game requires a minimum number of players that's above your threshold (e.g. you often end up with only three players, but the game needs at least four to run)<br/>* The game requires a set number players, or a very limited range (e.g. Polaris)<br/>* Character ownership is an important aspect of play AND story continuity is a virtue<br/>(working around the first issue is something like Polaris: characters are shared by all; whereas working around the second might be a very loose old-school dungeon crawl, where no one blinks an eye if a character suddenly disappears or a new one is found in a chest, but everyone wants the right to keep playing their character when they do come to play)<br/>* The game features a reward cycle tied to character advancement and doesn't work well with characters of different power levels<br/>(Here it would be fun to do something like In a Wicked Age..., where you can play a character of any power level, but you end up filling a different role story-wise, where more powerful characters end up being villains or foils, and weaker characters become protagonists)<br/>* The game has a competitive aspect AND game balance requires players to be present in the game from the beginning<br/>* The game requires all the players who were there at the beginning to be there at the end (e.g. winner's score is decided based on the other players' remaining resources)<br/>* The minimum duration of play is a long period (whether measured in hours or in sessions). (e.g. consider how easy it is to swap players in and out in a game like Poker)<br/><br/>Those things come to mind, for me. I think most people have most of those in mind, but one thing I don't often see discussed is how exclusive character ownership limits a lot of these factors. Games where you don't "own" a specific character--and games where you multiple characters, to a lesser extent--help you be more flexible when it comes to players coming and going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282314/#Comment_282314" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T06:08:50+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  6:08AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elizabeth,<br/><br/>I'd love to hear what it is about the design of Blowback that makes that work!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282326/#Comment_282326" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T06:57:14+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  6:57AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Yeah, In A Wicked Age is a good call, Peter.</blockquote>\nI've actually found that having people switch in and out for In a Wicked Age causes problems.

It's not necessarily the game system but the campaign setup. You could have the adventure centred around a single location, like a university or a starship. In both cases for each adventure someone might not be present due to classes, some other mission they're doing (if you're using XP assume that and level them up that way as long as not appearing is either on a consistend pre-determined schedule or not frequent), and you could have a pool of 3-4 characters for each player anyway that they would draw 1-2 characters from for each mission depending on what they're doing. There's campaign continuity, but it's not a setup where they're on a long caravan journey and having someone disappear doesn't make sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282369/#Comment_282369" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T08:50:56+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  8:50AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2010 8:52AM by blankshield.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the old-school box: Amber Diceless is lovely for this.  Really, any game based on the Amber mythos would handle it well; it's a chaos-tolerant setting.  Nine Worlds also does very well, for the same kind of reasons that Fate games do.  D&amp;D4 seems to me like it would do well, but if the anecdotes of the Monday game are any indication, it actually doesn't.  <br/><br/>Our Friday night crew has actually (been forced to) evaluate a lot of board games for this particular feature.  Touch of Evil handles this really well, in both directions.  Citadels does OK, but it's a bit bumpy to add a player.  BSG, actually, handles adding players far better than we'd expected.  When someone sits down, deal them in from the existing loyalty deck, then adjust the deck for the new # of players; no real hiccups to play.  Most board games, predictably, are lousy at handling chaos.<br/>Oh, and lest I forget the perfect game for adding/dropping players and chaos tolerance: Duel of Ages.<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282373/#Comment_282373" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T08:57:38+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  8:57AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>Most board games, predictably, are lousy at handling chaos.</blockquote>\nTotally off-topic, but well said.

We had a player out for two weeks, and our campaign ground to a halt and died, because the three guardmice PCs were all intertwined, and on a mission together on the frontier.<br/><br/>I think any game is chaos-tolerant in that way if its sufficiently episodic. Like, if we had stuck to quick, single-session missions, it would have been much easier to continue without a fourth player.<br/><br/>But then, you lose a lot of the fun of "Next week on Mouse Guard ...!" when you play that way.<br/><br/>To me, chaos-intolerant campaign play is almost always more fun, but is also always harder to manage with everyone's schedules.<br/><br/>EDIT: Sorry.

Around here, screen presence and spotlight order are not super casual - we build toward each character's big moment, and all the "next week on" usually drives home the upcoming character's epic episode. Stuff gets telegraphed sessions in advance. We structure the whole season around who is going big, when. So when that guy doesn't show up, it really knocks the wind out of our sails. And <i>any </i>missing player means that build gets messed up, if only a little.

Sometimes people would make an excuse for why they happened to come swinging in on that chandelier, other times someone would yell "GOOD HEAVENS, IT'S LORD REGINALD!! HOW DID HE GET HERE?!" and never mention it again.<br/><br/>I appreciate setting up <i>in advance</i> expectations.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with designing or running a game in which you say "everyone has to be here all the time or we don't play".  So long as everyone understands the rule up front, it works great.  Nobody guilts each other or feels guilty if people can't show and the game doesn't happen. Of course at some point you have to set it aside if it keeps not-happening, but that actually tells you something, that the people didn't want to play that game with the priority that the group set up for it.

That seems to mean that while a strict episodic approach works for player variability it tends to fail hard on that account.<br/><br/>While I've had some success with hacking social systems onto both more and less traditional games, such as 7th Sea and a Vampire:the Masquerade version of TSOY, I don't consider those places where the design of the games suited that style of play in any particular way. <br/><br/>If you want a long form game that has continuing (non-episodic) action and is chaos tolerant, then I suggest the following:<br/><br/>1) Micro-tension - rather than trying to fit dramatic tension into a full session or even the overall game play arc, make it so there are guaranteed to be several rises and falls of tension in even a 90 minute session (without making things feel rushed versus a 6 hour session's rises and falls). And do not link these to scenes or characters in a direct way, because that ownership (indirect or direct) will cheapen the tension for the less involved players. <br/><br/>2) Characters must be tied into the active elements of plot and theme at a fundamental, mechanical level. So that as things change in those elements during play even absent characters will still be affected through the minimum of mechanical fuss. This also enables the addition of new characters very easily, as they can both introduce new plots and themes and link directly to ones that already exist. <br/><br/>3) Ideally, enable any player even the GM to be missing and the game to continue, which means make the GMing duties both simple and distributable - or just make the game GMless (both of these are very rare for long form games). <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282582/#Comment_282582" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T04:15:37+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  4:15AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2010 4:15AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone, lots of good ideas.

When you read a pulpy sort of novel, while there is a dramatic tension that rises and falls over the story as a whole, there is a tendency for that same pattern to occur within each chapter, where the individual chapter may contain multiple scenes and actors and what not, it is the literary structure of that chapter that seems to drive things to a bridging moment where you want to jump to that next chapter and read more. If you work that structure into the game dynamics with some customization in terms of how long or short the chapter takes, then in addition to the immediacy of a given scene and the long term interest of the story's climax, you can play through two 45 minute chapters in a 90 minute game and still feel as though you've accomplished something. <br/><br/>Oddly enough, while I'm focusing on this as a literary inspiration, this doesn't need to be confined to a literary source, these intermediate arcs of tension often occur across the space of a longer story in things like movies as well. The problem is that the forced structure of a TV show makes it very difficult to tap those sorts of stories for variable length dramatic structures. In general of course, we should be wary about over borrowing, RPGs have their own problems (like player chaos) and their own unique capabilities, which means there are almost certainly story structures in RPGs unavailable in other media. <br/><br/>As far as (2), connecting the mechanical and thematic elements of the characters, situations, and setting as deeply as possible is likely the best approach. What that means is a chain of consequences occurs when something changes (which should occur fairly often). My dashing rogue gets better at sword fighting, so the swordsman's guild gets more dangerous, so your absent helpless romantic gets more obsessed with vengeance against the guild (due to his brother's death). And maybe the next session a new player shows up and links herself in by taking a fugitive trait also linked to the swordsman's guild. The more connections you have the fewer characters you need around to affect the whole network, while still having impacts for everyone making absent characters more just not appearing on the page, than conspicuously held in stasis. It also gives more room to integrate new characters - whether from new players, from a GM swapping player roles with another player, or even by letting players bring in new characters.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282653/#Comment_282653" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T13:32:20+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  1:32PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes!<br/><br/>Those strike as tricky design specs, but now I understand what you were saying.
