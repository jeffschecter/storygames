Jared Sorensen turned me on to his <a href="http://www.memento-mori.com/other/games/colorwheel.html" rel="nofollow">Color Wheel</a> system, which uses bead-drawing as a central resolution mechanic. As it happens, bead-drawing is <i>not</i> on the list of the games Buddha wouldn't play. Yay!<br/><br/>So I'm trying to explore the funky permutations of bead-drawing. I'm hoping that story-games can help spot some awesome I'm missing. Here's the system in place for Do right now. I'll skip over the rules regarding narration rights and player-roles, focusing on the bead-drawing and what it means mechanically.\n<blockquote>The focus of play is your intervention on someone else's conflict. You're kind of like a hostage negotiator, an old west Peacemaker, or King Solomon. There are four possible outcomes to any intervention:\n<ul><li>Your action is successful and the conflict is resolved. This is the equivalent of a "critical success" in D&amp;D</li>\n<li>Your action is successful, but the conflict is unresolved. You discover that this wasn't the right way to solve the problem. (This is a hit on your ego, which has some nice Buddhist flavor.)</li>\n<li>Your action is unsuccessful and the conflict is resolved. Meaning that you could solve the problem, but totally accidentally. (Again, another hit on the ego.)</li>\n<li>Your action is unsuccessful and the conflict is unresolved. This is the equivalent of a "critical failure" in D&amp;D.</li></ul></blockquote>\nHere is how you find out if your intervention was (un)successful and if the conflict is (un)resolved:\n<blockquote>You have six traits, each representing different styles of intervention, each assigned to one of six colors in the color wheel: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Purple. There is a bag in the middle of the table containing one blue, one red and one yellow bead.<br/><br/>If you're using a primary-colored trait, you want to draw bead of that primary color. (If you're using a blue trait, then you're trying to pull a blue bead out of the bag.)<br/><br/>If you're using a secondary-colored trait, you want to draw either of the primary colors that comprise the secondary color. (If you're using an orange trait, then you're trying to pull a red <i>or</i> yellow bead out of the bag.)<br/><br/>If you draw your desired color, then your action succeeds and the conflict is resolved. If you don't draw your desired color, then your action was unsuccessful and the conflict is unresolved.<br/><br/>Return the bead to the bag after it's been drawn.</blockquote>\nThat's the very basic system, then I introduced some karma mechanics inspired by the pool of beads we were brainstorming in the Awesome-o-fy Dark Sun threads <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1673&amp;page=2#Item_38" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1749&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">here</a>.\n<blockquote>Before you draw, each of your companions may offer a black or white bead in order to influence the outcome of your intervention. Black beads indicate they want you to succeed, regardless of the conflict's outcome. White beads indicate they want the conflict resolved, regardless of whether you succeed.<br/><br/>When all beads are offered, they're placed in the bag.<br/><br/>If you draw a black bead, your action is successful, but the conflict is unresolved. You may accept this outcome or save this bead for a guaranteed success later. If you accept the outcome, remove the bead from the bag. If you save the bead, place it in your bowl.<br/><br/>If you draw a white bead, the conflict has been resolved, but your action was unsuccessful. You somehow accidentally resolved the conflict, but it wasn't through your direct intervention.<br/><br/>All other beads that were offered before you drew remain in the bag. Over time, black and white beads will accumulate in the bag, representing your group's collective karmic weight.</blockquote>\nSo that's how the karma mechanic works before you draw. Here's how it works <b>after</b> you draw.\n<blockquote>After you've drawn a bead from the bag, you may spend a black or white bead to augment the outcome of your intervention. A black bead flips a failure to a success. A white bead flips an unresolved conflict to a resolved conflict.</blockquote>\nPhew! Okay, so that's it. Some discoveries:\n<ul><li>Playtests have revealed that, over time, the black and white beads <i>way</i> out-number red, blue and yellow beads.  While this has some cool karmic associations, it becomes mechanically problematic as you're pretty much expecting to draw a black or white bead every time.</li>\n<li>As play progresses, players become more cautious about offering black or white beads, knowing that they aren't just influencing their companion's outcomes, but their own as well.</li>\n<li>One cool thing: it's really easy to implement "modifiers" without any arithmetic. Just toss a bead in a bag, that's your modifier.</li></ul>\nThat's a few discoveries, but I'm wondering if anyone else has explored bead mechanics. What weird permutations and funkiness have you discovered?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92572/#Comment_92572" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T09:49:34+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  9:49AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Daniel,<br/>\n<br/>\nOther games with interesting bead/stone drawing mechanics are Vin Diakuw's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://members.fortunecity.com/vindiakuw/reverseRPG.htm" rel="nofollow">Reverse RPG</a>, Paul Elliott's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.geocities.com/mithrapolis/Babel.html" rel="nofollow">Chronicles of Babel</a>, and Scott Knipe's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050405165452/www.actionroll.com/gildedmoose/pdfs/wyrd.pdf" rel="nofollow">Wyrd</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

You could start the bag with some set number of red, yellow and blue beads (e.g., four), or have a number of each equal to the number of players.

I'm really digging Wyrd's starting off with a set number of beads that do not get replenished. Very thematically appropriate.<br/><br/>Chronicles of Babel's method of determining difficulty \xe2\u20ac\u201d "For normal actions, draw two beads and choose the preferred outcome of both draws. Only draw one bead if the task is difficult. Draw three if the task is easy." \xe2\u20ac\u201d is also rather cool.<br/><br/>I'm amused to see the Reverse RPG has a similar method of spending beads to "flip" the success/failure axis.<br/><br/>I searched for reviews of Asylum, but couldn't find much detail on how beads were used in that game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Is there some reason you couldn't start the bag with more than one of each red, yellow and blue beads? </b><br/><br/>Mostly I didn't want to inconvenience players any further by scrounging for beads. My game designs <i>usually</i> use the most commonplace items available, so beads instead of d6s are an unusual deviation from that methodology.<br/><br/>Matt Gandy suggested that red, blue or yellow beads be added between scenes depending on people's actions. Alternatively, one red, blue and yellow bead could be added at the end of a scene so that black and white are building, so are the basic three colors.<br/><br/>Still, my primary concern is making players scrounge for supplies.<br/><br/><br/><b>Could there be some sort of option to Kharmically discharge the bag? Such as taking out more than one bead, or not putting them in your bowl for additional effect?</b><br/><br/>Right now, if you draw a bead and you don't want its result to occur, you may save it for later and draw it again. There is not a method at the moment for removing beads from the bag without shifting them over to your own pool.<br/><br/><br/><b>I have to ask, what's this game about?</b><br/>You're flying monks traveling on a pilgrimage. On this journey, you visit many different worlds. Someone from each of these worlds has written you a letter, describing a conflict or problem they're having. As a player, you use one of these letters to build the world and create situations. There are Buddhist and Taoist allegories throughout the setting and system, without specific real-world references. (Similar to how Dogs in the Vineyard handles Mormonism.)<br/><br/>Check out the official <a href="http://www.danielsolis.com/do" rel="nofollow">Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</a> site for more info and some letters written by awesome people.<br/><br/><br/><b>How quickly do the beads in the bag build up - and do they reset between sessions?</b><br/><br/>Right now, it's all player-driven. At first, players are exploring the system so they're pretty enthusiastic about dropping in tokens. Then they get more tactical as they try to balance their own karmic resources with the beads in the bag. Right now, the rules say that the bag resets between worlds.<br/><br/>Presently, one world takes up one session. Jonathan Walton has suggested that some worlds ought to be little single-scene "cat stuck in a tree" one-shots, while other worlds would have more lasting issues that could span a few sessions. I've not decided how to handle this just yet, but it's something to consider.<br/><br/><br/><b>is pebble-counting allowed?</b><br/><br/>Actually, right now I'm assuming that pebble-counting is happening all the time. I like a bit of tactical decision-making in a game, so counting the beads is alright by me. What prevents it from happening much right now is that it isn't a closed system. New beads are added to the overall pool at certain points, so that makes it harder to track the overall resource levels.<br/><br/>Making it a closed system would be strategically interesting, though. It would further alleviate my concerns about making players scrounge for play materials.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92906/#Comment_92906" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T07:13:58+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  7:13AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A while back a guy named Aidan Grey was working on a game called Crux, Crossroads in Reality.

You might want to check it out.

First glance reveals a drawing of one to three beads based on difficulty, similar to Chronicles of Babel.

Because if you don't want to escalate the number of primary color beads, you could limit the number of black and white beads somehow.  I don't know if there is a set number of black and white beads, or how their resource economy works.  The rules snippet mentions spending the beads, which implies they then leave the economy, and I would guess new black and white beads are generated somewhere, somehow.  Limiting these, or tying them together could keep the bag from filling up with lots of black and white beads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93111/#Comment_93111" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T03:31:57+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  3:31AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Precisely my thoughts.
