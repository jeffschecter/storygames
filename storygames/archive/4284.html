The idea of talking over which issues will and won't come up in the game is pretty new to me and my players. <br/><br/>We've just played a couple games that could've really benefitted from a pre-game chat, Dogs, the Roach, and others. <br/><br/>So here's my question: Do you story gamers and designers with more social contract experience than me have any suggestions or specific issues you talk about before playing? Are there any common issues that should be discussed before most games? Any specific issues for certain games?<br/><br/>In my head, I see a general reference sheet of things like "How dark, violent, gory, funny, sexy, silly, etc do we want our game to be?" as well as extended story questions like "What do we do if someone doesn't show up? Fall back game? Have a beer? Etc." <br/><br/>I have a sneaking suspicion that there's a lot of potential snags out there that I can't imagine cause I've never run into them. Would you guys care to help me out?<br/><br/>Does my question even make sense?<br/><br/>-Jarvis                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96338/#Comment_96338" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T11:56:15+00:00" title="September 15, 2007 11:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I don't think I probably do things different from you.

However, we just talked freely - the bullet points below might give you the impression that it was a formal meeting, but this is really just a distilled version of some questions that came up in the general conversation.<br/><br/>- What stuff did we like from the last campaign we played? Do we want more of the same, or something different?<br/>- Do we want to use a different system or setting? If so, what?<br/>- Do we still want to play at my house, with the same people, at about the same frequency?

I include rules in Breaking the Ice, for people to negotiate the social space about sex and the tone of the game before they start (ratings and genre).  A debrief session is common in some live forms, like jeep.  Talking out the big stuff that happened, grounding players a bit if needed, seeing how the game ran for people. Doing that ahead of time would be great as well.<br/><br/>I suspect that most folks don't approach this conciously.  You will probably benefit from it if  you do. From the title of the thread, I though you were working on a game that included a "social contract sheet" like a character sheet, etc. A funny and interesting idea. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>best,<br/>Emily                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96428/#Comment_96428" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T20:46:07+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  8:46PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The current version of my game, <i>Misspent Youth</i>, has an explicit social contract document that you create as part of the world creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96503/#Comment_96503" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T08:32:44+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  8:32AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As mentioned you *do* do this, it just isn't explicit.  And that's OK.   I think it is important that you like and trust the people you game with, and if you like and trust them, you'll feel hopefully comfortable discussing issues either in advance, as they come up, or after the fact - whatever works to help everyone understand what's fun for you and what isn't.  It's good to think ahead about logicstics and what your expectations are in terms of commitment, as well as stuff that is going to squick you if it is brought into the game.  I definitely don't think it needs to be formal (although I'm eager to see what you've come up with, Rob!)<br/><br/>For example, in one of my groups, it is understood that if one of us can't make it, the other guys do something else rather than play "our" game.  Everybody I play with knows not to bring sexual violence on stage when I'm playing.

I'd love to get a follow up on how you feel making a somewhat explicit contract works for you and the effects good and bad it has. I'd also love to see your finished product, especially if you'd be willing to release it under a Creative Commons Share Alike license. Even barring that I'd love to see it. Anyway... I develop all my theory shows on my wiki, under a CC-SA. I was originally hoping people might be interested and add additional notes, and design out new shows via the wiki, but that option has appeared completely nonpopular. Anyway here's the section from that show that may be pertinet. I'm not sure if it will be helpful or not, but it certainly can't be harmful. Jarvis, you can use this however you want so don't worry about the CC-SA if you find it useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial contract in the open.<br/>\n<br/>\n* What do we need to discuss.<br/>\no No magic answer<br/>\n<br/>\n* here's some things<br/>\no Who can play?<br/>\n+ Everyone, only certain people<br/>\n<br/>\no How long will we play?<br/>\n+ A few sessions<br/>\n+ when we can<br/>\n+ marriage<br/>\n<br/>\no Attendance expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\no Who can run games.<br/>\n+ one single person<br/>\n+ switch off<br/>\n+ do we strongly encourage different DM,s or take a lax approach.<br/>\n<br/>\no Expected style of play<br/>\n+ hardcore dungeon crawl<br/>\n+ experimental story game<br/>\n+ deep immersion act-fest<br/>\n+ something else<br/>\n<br/>\no How do we choose games.<br/>\n<br/>\no How do we deal with conflict between players<br/>\n+ GM as lord<br/>\n+ Majority rule<br/>\n+ some unstated negotation<br/>\n# we're all friends<br/>\n<br/>\no What is the setting and situation<br/>\n<br/>\no How do we deal with rule changes<br/>\n<br/>\no food<br/>\n+ do we eat before after or during<br/>\n+ who is expected to pay for what<br/>\n<br/>\no What are we expected to bring<br/>\n+ pizza money<br/>\n+ pencils<br/>\n+ paper<br/>\n+ dice<br/>\n+ nothing<br/>\n<br/>\no How difficult is the game<br/>\n+ everyone is going to be succesful<br/>\n+ bring your ten foot poles and stakes for the doors<br/>\n<br/>\no Tone of the game<br/>\n+ serious<br/>\n+ funny<br/>\n+ sad and tragic                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96878/#Comment_96878" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T09:43:17+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  9:43AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2007 9:43AM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't discuss social contract before the game.

And that's OK.   I think it is important that you like and trust the people you game with, and if you like and trust them, you'll feel hopefully comfortable discussing issues either in advance, as they come up, or after the fact - whatever works to help everyone understand what's fun for you and what isn't.  It's good to think ahead about logicstics and what your expectations are in terms of commitment, as well as stuff that is going to squick you if it is brought into the game.  I definitely don't think it needs to be formal (although I'm eager to see what you've come up with, Rob!)</blockquote>\nI'm going to go a step further and note that, usually, you discover your Lines and Veils <i>in play</i>.  A pre-game Lines and Veils discussion only gets you so far.  Sometimes, you just don't know that a certain thing will squick you quite as much as it does.  Also, in a pre-game discussion between relative strangers, there can be social pressure to be "edgy" which can push a quiet player outside of his zone of acceptance because he doesn't have the social impact to object successfully.  Conversely, if you already know your fellow players, then you probably already have a pretty good idea of their Lines and Veils, so a pre-game discussion is not really necessary.<br><br>Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, I made a conscious choice to exclude a pre-game Lines and Veils discussion from the rules of <i>Dirty Secrets</i>.  There's one system concession to Lines, which is the group's decision to allow minors to be Characters or not.  Beyond that, the players simply have to address the issue with the various tools at their disposal.  (Specifically, the game relies heavily on the use of Veils; the Lines are built into the game design and can't really be changed much without actually changing the game.)<br><br>Now, part of that is personal style, and I'm certainly not saying that a pre-game discussion is bad.  What I <i>am</i> saying is that constant awareness of the emerging Lines and Veils of the other players at the table is <i>more</i> important than a pre-game discussion.  There also needs to be an openness to having a player object in play to the introduction of a specific element.  I also think that a <i>post-game</i> discussion, like Emily discusses, is valuable for revealing where someone's Lines or Veils were breached unintentionally (if it didn't come up in play), so that the group gets a better collective understanding of specific players' Lines and Veils for the future.<br><br>Of course, this gets us to <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=32" rel="nofollow">I Will Not Abandon You vs. No One Gets Hurt</a>, which is essentially about breaching someone else's Lines in love, but I'm not going to discuss that now.<br><br>Seth Ben-Ezra<br>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
