The problem of it was that a lot of it was just a smorgasborg of little cool ideas (hot air balloons! canals! weird Inca politics! gnosticism!) without enough of a unifying theme or a strong tie in to the actual rules. <br/><br/>So, the thing we like the best about our game system is how well the personality/social rules deal with melodrama (the sort of melodrama that A Song of Ice and Fire is full of was a big inspiration on what we're trying to do and the game is generally very ASoIaF-inspired). We've got what we think are cool rules for internal emotional conflict, having in-game events impact character personality in thematic ways, etc. So what we're thinking of now are ways to built cultures for our setting that basically act as machines for generating melodramatic plot hooks. Some ideas:<br/><br/>A. Blood feud: I've read my Icelandic Sagas and nothing gets the melodrama going faster than a good blood feud.<br/><br/>B. Conflicting loyalties: different institutions that demand different sorts of loyalty from people (see Jon Snow in ASoIaF).<br/><br/>C. Oaths: having a society that takes oaths very seriously can result in lots of fun melodrama.<br/><br/>D. Marriage customs: I'm drawing a bit of a blank on how to do this specifically, I don't want to go with "characters angst about being forced into an arraigned marriage."<br/><br/>E. Keep it personal: politics that're based on personal connections rather than ideology or tradition, still working on how to implement this.<br/><br/>Any other ideas? What cultural elements result in good old fashioned blood up to the elbows melodrama that'll suck PCs right in?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195574/#Comment_195574" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T04:30:42+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  4:30AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/> well just where the wedding will take place is a big enough fight between the in-laws without mentioning any other associated customs.<br/><br/>What do you mean by "politics that are based on personal connections rather than ideology or tradition"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195576/#Comment_195576" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T04:39:33+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  4:39AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs in the Vineyard has a handy run-down of all the juicy things people get het up about:<br/><br/>1.

Everybody does it, but you're not supposed to be caught or do it in public, or your spouse will be shamed.<br/><br/>Reciprocity is a cool thing, too. If you're given a gift, you're expected to reciprocate. If you accept a gift and not pay back in some way or other, you're a douche. And to decline a gift is of course equally offensive. This way you'll get interesting situations like country A giving country B a huge gift, thereby forcing country B to join in A:s side of the war with country C, since B doesn't have the means to reciprocate the gift in any other way than with soldiers. but what happens if you recieve gifts from both parties in the war?<br/><br/>Also, of course, honor.

You're all pulling melodrama out of stuff that is well-established melodrama material.</p>\n<p>Want to make something <em>new</em> or <em>unfamiliar?</em> Then you have to think about what melodrama is: a drama of exaggerated emotion.</p>\n<p>So, you think about the cultures you're working with and their values. What things are people supposed to be quiet about? What things are they expected/permitted to be dramatic about? In my part of America, for instance, ladies are expected/permitted to be dramatic about marriage, and everyone's expected/permitted to be dramatic about divorce, but nobody's dramatic about, say, people dying. Different creeds have very different positions about whether you're allowed to be dramatic about god.</p>\n<p>People from different cultures <em>will and do</em> express their emotions differently depending on their upbringing and surroundings. Personally, I think melodrama's most interesting when there are <em>also</em> contrasting stressors that people will suffer under quietly. That helps make the drama <em>about</em> something, as opposed to being a needless show of excess.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
