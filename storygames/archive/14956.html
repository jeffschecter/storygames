Nathan suggested that we workshop the pledge rewards here. These are my ideas so far:<br/><br/><b>$5+ Student</b> \u2014 Sneak peeks at the artwork in development, an early copy of the PDF rules and I'll thank you on Cobweb Games.<br/><br/><b>$10+ Contributor's Skin</b>\u2014 Download the "Contributor's Skin," a fancier, exclusive play sheet, one week before release. Plus, I'll thank you on Cobweb Games and tell you how things are going (with sneak peeks and early PDFs).<br/><br/><b>$20+ Digital Scenarios</b> \u2014 Download the "Conventions of War" supplement, a book of illustrated Skins and scenarios for Chronicles of Skin, for quick-run convention one-shots. And I'll give you all the stuff above.<br/><br/><b>$30+ Priority </b>\u2014 You\u2019ll get the complete game before anyone else (all 72 cards, boxed and shiny), including international shipping, the PDFs (as above) and a big thank you.<br/><b><br/>$40+ Golden Priority</b> \u2014 As above, but I'll sign your copy of the game and I'll thank you as a Golden Contributor!<br/><br/><b>$50+ Name Me A Name</b> (Expires two weeks after the project starts) \u2014 In addition to the swag above, I invite you to help me pick names for the character cards. I really want to see the cool ideas you've got for how we can create naming styles for each of the warring cultures. We'll get together at the middle of the project and talk about it. I'll consolidate a few syntax guidelines, and you'll get creative. I can't wait!<br/><br/><b>$60+ Conventions of War Print</b> \u2014 We're doing a small print run of the Conventions of War supplement, an illustrated book of Skins and Scenarios to kick off your convention one-shots. If you choose to pledge $60 or more I'll send you one of these books in print before anyone else. Inside, you'll find an extended version of the original rules with loads more room for examples, plus I'll sign it, and I'll include all the goodies from the options above.<br/><br/><b>$75+ Rank 4 Custom Card</b> \u2014 As above, right, but get this: You\u2019ll get your own, custom Rank 4 card, with a character name of your choice! That means you\u2019ll have a card that no one else has, anywhere in the world. It will be more powerful than any other character card in the deck, and it will have your name on it! Awesome. I want one.<br/><br/><b>$100+ Platinum Priority</b> \u2014 The platinum deck. Seriously, every card will have a different reverse side. Only 20 will ever get made. I'll also thank you personally in the PDF rules and give you all the perks listed above.<br/><br/><b>$125+ Platinum Lullaby</b> \u2014 This is just like the Platinum, but you'll also get the very, very limited audio version of the rules. That's me, with full blown Irishness, reading the rules and explaining them as I go. Rock-a-by-baby...<br/><br/><b>$150 FAQ Voice</b> (One Off Item) \u2014 In addition to all the above, you'll get the chance to field your questions directly to me, and we'll answer them in an interview together. We'll record your FAQ to generate a resource for future gamers and post the audio online. If you're good at insightful qustions, or you like interviewing, this is a chance to make a worthy contribution to the project.<br/><br/><b>$200+ Artist's Impression</b> \u2014 Jason Hickey, Art Director for Cobweb Games, will give you a 30 minute private tutorial (with 2 hours of email support) on "Pimping Your Skin." Despite the porno title, this is just a lesson on sketching techniques with advice about line rendering and shading for would-be artists looking to jazz up their CoS drawing skills. You'll also get the Platinum Lullaby, of course and all the other goodies!<br/><br/><b>$300+ Founder's Bundle</b> (Only 2 available) \u2014 Founder's Box. Phew! So you want your own box? I\u2019m only making six of these, one for me, two for you and four for the prizes below. Our names will be on all four of them. Inside, they\u2019ll be filled with the Platinum deck. But you\u2019ll also get a spare deck with one of the Rank 4 cards mentioned above (with your awesome name on it). Then there\u2019s the PDFs, the sneak peek and your name on the website. Also, your name will be in the rules booklet and you\u2019ll be listed as a Founder. You\u2019ll be invited to name the character cards, of course and everything will be shipped to you, first, before anyone else in the world. You'll also get the Funder's T-Shirt, which will have all our names on the back, and Jason's gorgeous logo on the front (send me your size).<br/><br/><b>$500+ Deluxe Priority</b> (Only 3 available) \u2014 A custom playmat, made from hand cut leatherette, with bespoke artwork by Jason Hickey, signed by myself and the artist. This is the thing that I'll wish I had made more of. But I'll only be making three. I'll be consulting with Narrativa in Italy, who are the only people I know of who've done something similar. We'll also send you everything in the Founder's bundle, including that gorgeous t-shirt. You'll be the most exclusive human I've ever known.<br/><br/><b>$1000+ Future Priority</b> \u2014 Jason Hickey will be your artist for an entire game of Chronicles of Skin. I'll facilitate the game, and give you tips on how to enjoy it the most. Plus, you get everything above, and every Cobweb Game that has been or will be, for ever more. That's at least a copy of Hell for Leather, in addition to Chronicles of Skin and the Conventions of War book, but also Way of the Agent, Monster Mash (shhhhh, nobody knows about that one yet) and anything else I ever write. I'll even put your picture on my wall (which I'd like you to provide, signed, if possible). You'll get the Leather Play Mat, the Founder's bundle, and all the other stuff.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340006/#Comment_340006" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T12:09:32+00:00" title="August 22, 2011 12:09PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the escalating levels, but I think you should cut them down to about six. Electronic / Print / Premium Print / Deluxe / Patron / Stupid Amounts Of Money.<br/><br/>At the higher levels, people aren't really paying for the stuff you give. They are paying to support your project.

My initial reaction is that you have too many levels, and they're very fine-grained. It'll be confusing, and confusion on the internet = people walking (clicking, I suppose) away. After the $300 level i just stopped reading, actually.<br/><br/>So here's my sense of how folks make purchasing/funding decisions (based on multiple years selling at gen con + my kickstarter experience, for anyone who cares). There's mental breakpoints where folks judge whether they think what they're buying is worth the money - in my experience, its something like $10, then $20, then $35ish, then $50ish, then about every $25 from there. I would encourage you to try and make funding levels at those breakpoints, modified by your actual costs and what YOU think the reward level is worth. <br/><br/>Also, I don't know how much this is going to retail for once it's in general release, which is a benchmark that will skew all your other reward levels. I saw from the other thread that its costing ~7 to print, and i see that the $30 level gets you the game before general release...is it retailing for $30? Or what? <br/><br/>If this were my project, I'd do something like this:<br/><br/>$1-10 - impulse buy/i like this idea contribution (in physical space it's more like $1-5, but I think since it's a funding deal folks will throw in 10 bucks for something they think is cool). People will pledge $1. It doesn't make any sense to me, but hey, whatever. I would make this your Student level, but add the Contributors Skin. This makes it a special funding-only thing they can have.<br/><br/>$20 - this is cool, and I want to get something special. (I'm assuming that the retail price for the print game is going to be &gt;20). I'd offer the download of Conventions of War at this level.<br/><br/>$30 - Priority, as you say! I would say, if you want to offer signed things, either just sign all the print orders (at this level), or sign all higher levels. I don't think it's worth breaking out into it's own reward level.<br/><br/>$50 - Name Me A Name, really good for this level. I would keep it as it.<br/><br/>$100 - Platinum Deck, again very cool. This is where you really start getting to what Graham calls "Patron" level, you're getting such an amount of money that you're entering into a new relationship with these contributors. I would put the custom card as part of this level, and perhaps the printed Conventions of War book.<br/><br/>Now, considering the rest of your rewards, I think you could an array of one-off $200 awards for FAQ Voice and Artists Impression. This is the upper limit of the Patron stuff. Over this is Stupid Amounts of Money, which all seem pretty sweet, and there's no reason not to include them.<br/><br/>But, what will happen is that people who are kind interested will scroll through, hit the $100 reward and go "well I'm def not paying that much" and go back to the lower tier rewards to see what tickles their fancy. Having fewer of those, farther apart, will actually make their choice easier and put more money towards your project.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? (Also, I invite others to critique my breakdown of this kind of stuff works, of course)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340079/#Comment_340079" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T17:53:31+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  5:53PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really helpful Graham and Nathan.

For example if you go through the trouble of recording a reading of the rules, audio is fairly easy to distribute. does it serve you better to make that sort of thing limited, premium or free? Premium sounds fine, free may also work. but limited?<br/><br/>maybe don't use the word porno in any of the descriptions just so you don't get hit by web filters?<br/><br/>good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340184/#Comment_340184" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-23T12:23:14+00:00" title="August 23, 2011 12:23PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>maybe don't use the word porno in any of the descriptions just so you don't get hit by web filters?</blockquote> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Good.<br/><br/>This advice is great. I've used it to compile a shorter list:<br/><br/><b>$1+ Contributor's Skin</b> \u2014 Download the "Contributor's Skin," a fancier, exclusive play sheet, one week before release. Plus, I'll thank you on Cobweb Games and tell you how things are going (with sneak peeks and early PDFs).<br/><br/><b>$15+ Conventions of War</b> \u2014 Get the exclusive PDF of "Conventions of War," an illustrated book of Skins and Scenarios to kick off your convention one-shots. This book is a reward for your eyes only. Inside, I'll thank you personally for your contribution. I'll also send you updates on the project and early, exclusive access to the Contributor's Skin (above).<br/><br/><b>$30+ Priority Shipment!</b>\u2014 You\u2019ll get the complete game before anyone else (all 72 cards, boxed and shiny), including international shipping, the Conventions of War PDF, the Contributor's skin (as above) and a big thank you. A huge one, actually, listed in a special place.<br/><br/><b>$50+ Name Me A Name</b> (Expires two weeks after the project starts) \u2014 In addition to the swag above, I invite you to help me pick names for the character cards.

Seriously, every card will have a different reverse side. Only 20 will ever get made. I'll also thank you personally in the PDF rules and give you all the perks listed above. In addition, get this: You\u2019ll get your own, custom <b>Rank 4</b> card, with a character name of your choice! That means you\u2019ll have a card that no one else has, anywhere in the world. It will be more powerful than any other character card in the deck, and it will have your name on it! Awesome. I want one.

Inside, you'll find an extended version of the original rules with loads more room for examples, plus I'll sign it, and I'll include all the goodies from the options above.<br/><br/><b>$200 Paint Your Skin</b> (One Off Item) \u2014 Jason Hickey, Art Director for Cobweb Games, will give you a private tutorial (with email support) on how to "Paint Your Skin." Using his 12 years of design experience, Jason will help you turn a scribbled Skin into a gorgeous artefact. Jay loves talking about art, and he's looking forward to meeting you. So get in quick! In addition, you'll also get the Platinum reward (above), and we'll turn your design into a T-Shirt.<br/><br/><b>$200 Voice of the Patron</b> (One Off Item) \u2014  I invite you to field your questions about the game directly to me, and we'll answer them in an interview together. We'll record it as a resource for future gamers and post the audio online. If you're good at insightful questions, or you like interviewing, this is a chance to make a worthy contribution to the project. You'll also get the Platinum reward, of course and all the other goodies! You'll feature in the audio recording of the rules, and I will thank you there profusely, you'll be be given the audio recording early, and you'll be invited to talk about and represent the project by voice (or video) during IndieGoGo updates.<br/><br/><b>$500+ Founder's Play Mat</b> (Only four available) \u2014 A custom playmat, made from hand cut leatherette, with bespoke artwork by Jason Hickey, signed by myself and the artist. This is the thing that I'll wish I had made more of. But I'll only be making four. I'll be consulting with Narrativa in Italy, who are the only people I know of who've done something similar. We'll also send you the game in a custom, Founder's Box. It will have your name on it, with a personal dedication and will include the Platinum rewards (deck, special card, Conventions of War, and all the other stuff, see above). You'll also get the Founder's T-Shirt, which will have all our names on the back, and Jason's gorgeous logo on the front. You'll be the most exclusive human I've ever known.<br/><br/><b>$1000+ Patron of Tomorrow</b> \u2014 Jason Hickey will be your artist for an entire game of Chronicles of Skin. I'll facilitate that game, and give you tips on how to enjoy it the most [this will be done over Skype, unless you live in the UK]. Plus, you get everything above, and every Cobweb Game that has ever been or ever will be, for ever more. That's at least a copy of Hell for Leather, in addition to Chronicles of Skin and the Conventions of War book, but also Way of the Agent and anything else I ever write. You will be invited to create one Skin &amp; Scenario for the Conventions of War book, which we (myself and Jason) will discuss with you over Skype. You'll get an even more exclusive Leather Play Mat, plus the Founder's Box and all the other stuff. I'll even put your picture on my wall (which I'd like you to provide, signed).

Again, your funder wants to know if what they're getting for their money is a better, same or worse deal than if they just buy it whenever. It could be in your project description (when this game is funded, it will retail for $25 and be available through X, Y and Z), or in the reward levels themselves. Another reason to do this is to show your funders that you're thinking ahead, you have a plan for general release and distribution, and thus that you actually can make this happen once you have the money.<br/><br/>Also, looking at your list again, at which level do you get the PDF of the game? the 1+ level, or the 15+ level? I know you're emphasizing the cool rewards in your descriptions, but if I'm funding a game, I want to know how to get the actual game - the Conventions of War supplement doesn't help me without it, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340722/#Comment_340722" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-27T13:12:12+00:00" title="August 27, 2011  1:12PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because this is a card game, I'm not going to release the game in PDF format.

Personally, I wouldn't give people the PDF option, if you think it's best experienced as a physical artifact.<br/><br/>In fact, I would consider getting rid of everything below $30. I am not quite sure what those levels are doing. You are offering something that isn't quite the game: you're selling something you don't particularly want to sell, I think.<br/><br/>I get a rough impression that many people gravitate towards $15 or $20 levels. What you really want is for those people to pay $30 and get The Game. So I would certainly remove the $20 option and consider losing everything below that, too.<br/><br/>(My rough research shows that, although it's often considered good to give people a way to support you at a low level, few people do.

Having $1 donations, while it doesn't add up to much, means you are giving folks a way to "touch" your project even if they're not able or willing to fund the higher levels. I don't see how this can be a bad thing. It's not like the guy who pledges a dollar would have pledged 30 if they didn't have the dollar option.<br/><br/>I do agree with Graham, tho, mostly cuz getting supplements for a game I'm NOT getting isn't much a reward. I don't see many people funding your $15 level, for example.<br/><br/>So, perhaps a $1 (or $5, or whatever) Thank You level, then straight to your $30 level. Psychologically, if you want to leverage that $20 price point, you could make it a level where you get the game non-priority (shipped at general release), but discounted from retail, plus the special playmat. Then, at $30, you get the priority arrival and supplement PDF. I think you would get a good amount of $20 contributions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340754/#Comment_340754" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-28T08:36:39+00:00" title="August 28, 2011  8:36AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(My rough research shows that, although it's often considered good to give people a way to support you at a low level, few people do.
