Fringe belief, religious or esoteric, is full of ritual and ceremony, interaction governed by complex rules and systems. Stuff thatsometimes has a parallel in what goes on around the table in role playing games. And all the occult stuff is way more diverse and interesting than the lutheran congregation next door.<br/><br/>I'm not that interested in what games people choose to play - I'm more interested in whether belief has played a role in your design philosophy - in complete games, scenarios, settings, session plans and so on. So - as an example -  not whether you like to play games about exorcism, but if you've actually performed one as part of a game?<br/><br/>Edit: Thanks; no problem at all, Keith.

The game was 'Everlasting: the Undying' (first edition only, I think.) In it, it was suggested that the players enact a ceremony before play began, involving the lighting of candles and introducing ones character to the others in a ritualised form. There was also a 'closing ritual' for the end; the analogy with modern neo-pagan rituals was extremely obvious. I mentioned it here once in another thread, along with a lengthy quote, but that was a long time ago so I've no idea where to find it now. To the shrewd observer, it was uncomfortably close to ritualistic means of invocation, albeit of fictional characters rather than 'genuine' demons or spirits or what-have-you.<br/><br/>My concerns are mostly of a psychological nature. Role-Playing is not a religion, and I worry what effects it might have on the players if it were somehow treated as such. A ceremony enacted seriously as if it was a part of preparation rather than part of the game itself might begin to take on too great a significance for the individual. We occasionally get reports of mentally ill people who turn to role-playing and wind up in terrible psychotic states. The press LOVE them, never mind that these people are usually affected by mental health issues before they even start gaming. So to be frank, not only would I worry about the affects the regular performance of such ceremonies might have on the players' minds, I would also be somewhat concerned about meeting a player who was enthusiastic to include such pseudo-religion in a game. That goes doubly for the ritual found in the Everlasting, which could be read as an attempt to actually become one's character rather than merely portray them. Also it might offend genuine practitioners who may be at the gaming table.<br/><br/>Naturally this doesn't extend to pretend rituals that occur in-character during the course of a game. Those are fiction, and anyone who can't tell fact from fiction should not be playing RPGs. I also don't include the 'rituals' from Beast Hunters since those are more like somatic signals and gestures to aid play, not anything in any way ritualistic in the occult sense of the word.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298647/#Comment_298647" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T12:11:27+00:00" title="October 28, 2010 12:11PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, found the other thread!<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11751" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11751</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298652/#Comment_298652" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T12:25:13+00:00" title="October 28, 2010 12:25PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Side note: A guy I know was called by a major Norwegian newspaper to ask about role-playing (larp, I think) and occultism.

I would love to see some of this game sometime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298711/#Comment_298711" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T21:54:44+00:00" title="October 28, 2010  9:54PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite>The game was 'Everlasting: the Undying' (first edition only, I think.)

I think I've had the candle thing in Everlasting somewhere at the back of my head for so long, but never looked into it - I heard about it years ago, and again in the thread Destriarch links to. So if the trick of making ritual spaces works as well as people say, it's a safe bet other techniques could be useful too?<br/><br/>GB Steve links to a really interesting interview. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that someone has taken up the idea of art as the Great Work in RPG's - it's an obvious thought, and there's no reason that meme should be limited to comics. I wonder if that's just a way of describing works indended to spread a political or social message, or if there are real differences?<br/><br/>I think this stuff - "occult" might not be the right term, perhaps that's like calling a living religion a myth - has been designed, and refined over a very long time, to affect people's perceptions and state of mind. With or without any actual faith to back it up, it's unlikely to conjure up any fiery demons, but it probably has the potential to manipulate your feelings in very powerful ways. Seems to me each element of ritual could fill a thread in itself. (What are those elements? I guess there's different answers from inside and outside the traditions, and different opinons according to anthropological schools?)<br/><br/>Lots of cool things to think about in this thread. How about the whole possession thing? It's a staple in many religions; it overlaps with stuff like method acting, and empathy exercises in psychologial counseling. (If a Haitian farm boy can do it, why couldn't sophisticated, educated norwegian farm boys manage it? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In the other thread, it's mentioned that ritual is not necessarily intentional - remember a time you slipped particularily deeply into character?

How did you introduce it to the players, and how did you convey the procedure?</blockquote>\nJust to add to JDCorley's comments, the ceremony in 'the Everlasting' is basically like a ritualised 'getting to know you' session. The GM introduces the session by telling the players that they will 'be eldritch' (the game's name for supernatural creatures) for the duration of the game. Each player then introduces their character (from an in-character perspective) one by one, while symbolically lighting a candle to indicate that the character is now present. The GM finally rounds it all off and starts the session, using more archaic and flowery language naturally. It's fundamentally similar to certain neo-pagan invocational and transformational rites wherein the participants 'become' their characters for the period that the game is in session. It's entirely optional, and its only intent is to adjust the mental state of the participants and add atmosphere to the proceedings. There's no mini-game in the process and it has no further effect on play beyond the purely psychological.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard" title="Anders Nygaard"><img alt="Anders Nygaard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/404/nXX62OQ3D3YOT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard">Anders Nygaard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299705/#Comment_299705" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T02:41:38+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  2:41AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the answers.
