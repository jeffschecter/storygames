I've played in one session games and full ten chapter games, but never in between.  My suggestion would be to play Chapter One, doing full character creation, and then proceed with Chapters Two, Three and Five.  For the next session, skip Chapter Six and play the rest through to the end.  Alternately, if this starts to make your first session run long, you could wait on Chapter Five and play it in the second session, in place of Chapter Seven.<br/><br/>Be sure to read the Radio Lightning passages for the chapters you skip.  Also, I wouldn't use the suggested changes in the "Playing a Short Game" section (p. 79) - just play the game normally without those two chapters.  <br/><br/>Let us know how it goes when you play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201050/#Comment_201050" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T04:40:38+00:00" title="April  7, 2009  4:40AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely don't neglect reading Radio Lightning for chapters you skip.  <br/><br/>I've never thought about how to structure the game for two sessions.  Basically that means six chapters (chapter 10 is just an epilogue).  I'm tempted to say 345-678, following the character generation advice on page 79.  But you get more well-rounded and invested characters if you play through chapter one, so maybe 145-678.  If you play only six chapters, start the game with each player either choosing to begin at the edge of the grid (like the short game rule) <i>or </i>with a character element pre-burned.  Make sure you mix it up.<br/><br/>If you have long sessions, 1345-678 would be good, with no need to pre-burn any character elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
