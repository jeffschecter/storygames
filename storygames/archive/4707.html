Poker provides a game system framework for reliving and redoing characters' regrets <br/><br/>What I like<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tPlayers list down memories of Vegas from their visits (or media they\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve seen about the city). Subsidiary characters are drawn from these memories, which should produce a visceral and varied set of people that can be drawn into the game\xe2\u20ac\u2122s scenes. Starting with a joint brainstorm should also put players in a vegas state of mind<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tI have a soft spot for games in which an urban setting is basically the hero. Vegas is ripe for this treatment.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tPoker is accessible, and cards + $$ are a nice representation of fate and power<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tThe intersecting worlds setting is intriguing <br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tAnteing characters is a totally cool central mechanism<br/><br/>Needs further elaboration<br/><br/>Without having tried it, my assumption would be to make characters much more valuable \xe2\u20ac\u201c something like $5000 or $10,000 rather than $5000/$1000 (maybe characters created at the start of hands are a little less valuable)<br/>Specify that the people from memories of vegas become the characters with \xe2\u20ac\u0153I wants\xe2\u20ac\u2122<br/>is the game over the first time a player gets rid of all four of their character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s \xe2\u20ac\u02dcif onlys\xe2\u20ac\u2122?<br/>is the alternative realities setting intended to embrace fantastic elements or just to allow for redoing history <br/>is there a mechanical role for the combine during the game<br/>examples of how to weave a few unconnected characters into scenes about the lead character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s \xe2\u20ac\u02dcif onlys\xe2\u20ac\u2122 \xe2\u20ac\u201c over the course of the game repeating use of characters will create patterns but the first few scenes might be disjointed<br/><br/>I hope Tony continues to develop this                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105990/#Comment_105990" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T10:55:04+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 10:55AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for a generous review of what was a very sketchy design concept. Your points are good.<br/><br/>I really wanted to work in a way that when a hand was resolved, it somehow changed the characters in the scene, possibly in a way connected to the cards. I had a vision of characters with cards or hands written on them as a sort of stat. It didn't pan out. This idea's back on the shelf for a while, but maube I'll have the brainstorm that brings it back to life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
