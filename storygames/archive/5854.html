You know, 11 years old, 12, 13... that general "area". Like, when hair starts growing in strange places.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure: when we played, there was a lot of fun, but also a lot of really disfunctional stuff going on, from railroading to player favouritism to Agenda Clash (a band one of my friends was really into) to just plain old power struggles.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, pretty much the entire population of places like this forum is made up of people in college or older. Some... much older. (If you're a young 'un, say hi! I want to hear from you in this thread.) <br/><br/>These "older" people (like you and me) are playing weird hippy games which, according to Google, are much more robust, clear, and coherent than what most of them played when they were thirteen years old. And Google is never wrong.<br/><br/>Here is my question: has anyone participated in a game, or observed young folks of that awkward age, playing "indie" RPGs? If so, how was the game different from the typical 20th-cy teenage A/D&amp;D escapade? Just the same? Wildly transformed? What was the dynamic at the table like? If you are an older gal or fellow, how did your presence affect things?<br/><br/>(Note: This, in my mind, is a completely different issue, not like "kids and adults playing RPGs together". It's about what happens when teenagers run the show for each other. If you disagree, on the other hand, chime in and say why. That's welcome, too.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130924/#Comment_130924" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T12:07:41+00:00" title="February 27, 2008 12:07PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to game with my son quite a bit. More often then not we've played D20, he compares everything to D20. These days he doesn't play as much because of the teenaging process he is currently experiencing. He's a cool kid, if you don't believe me just ask him.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have a lot of kids in my life and played in quite a few kid friendly games. I find that kids (8 to 16) need, for the most part, the structure that traditional games provide. This is true even though, once they get started you realize they never needed the structure in the first place. When given the "freedom" of some story games, or strict "restrictions" of others, they get stuck figuring out exactly what they can do.<br/><br/>I wonder if homeschooled kids would better get story games then traditionally schooled kids.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/morgue" title="morgue"><img alt="morgue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/morgue">morgue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131056/#Comment_131056" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T16:50:04+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  4:50PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen some indie games run with everyone in the age range 14-16 (Everyone Is John comes to mind - anarchic craziness), but never in that 11-13 range.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131058/#Comment_131058" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T16:52:39+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  4:52PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK.

"Getting stuck figuring out what exactly they can do" sounds like it, but I think it's also missing on various "whys" and "whatfors" very often.<br/></blockquote>\nWhat kind of "why's"?
