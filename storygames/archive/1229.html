                    I was wandering around Melbourne yesterday listening to the Sons of Kyros democasts (which rock) from the GenCon floor.  I had a couple of reactions:<br/>
<br/>
Best Friends:  The demo sounded great, but nowhere near as great as the demo Malcolm Craig ran for a few of us.  The only difference, as far as I can tell, is that Malcolm took a couple of seconds to have the group establish a context before getting us to create characters.  Without that, Jeff &amp; Judd &amp; co seemed to gravitate to high school girls, with fairly generic Stuff and Nonsense.  We ended up as concubines to the Emperor of China at the funeral of his principal wife and heir.  I had "Poisoned Hairpins" as my stuff and "Induced the heir to kill the Empress for my sake" as my Nonsense, and the other players were doing even cooler stuff.  Seems like that one step - establishing the context before the characters - had a big impact.<br/>
<br/>
Mortal Coil:  This game sounds great.  I'm thinking of using it for Mu, actually.  But at this stage I comprehensively fail to grok it tactically.  I'm not sure why you'd go only one action, why you'd go many, and what the consequences are.  Anyone got a better handle on it?                </div>

                            It was good for me to hear the Mortal Coil one as I didn't get a demo of it at the con. Malc picked it up and will probably run it at some point, so that will be cool.<br/>
<br/>
For Best Friends I was trying to keep the demo to just 10 minutes (and I think the "game" part is almost exactly that, which is amazing to me) ... so we went with the "default" setting of schoolgirls for simplicity. I think everyone around the table was on the same page about that before we started the demo, really.<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah, for a lot of the other demos I did the "heh, let's establish something that we want to play" thing and got some really varied stuff: Anime Furries, Desperate Housewives, Frat Boys, Fireman, Victorian Schoolchildren, Persian Fantasy, Young Women at a Wedding, as well as a few Modern Schoolfriends ones.<br/>
<br/>
And Malc is a performing monkey for sure. He was pretty stoked about that demo in China -- I think he plans to write it up as an AP himself.<br/>
<br/>
My own favourite demo was a Desperate Housewives one. It was sharp.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you like the MP3s. Many thanks to Judd and Jeff for doing this. I really appreciate their effort in this.                        </div>

Oh, cool.  I think maybe that's an important thing for anyone recording democasts to keep in mind - you have to make sure that sort of context gets vocalised explicitly for the audience.<br>
<br>
Still, I think the democast gets across the fact that Best Friends is an awesome game - has anyone heard it without being acquainted with the game beforehand?  It'd be cool to hear from someone who was ignorant of the game before hearing the recording.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Well, I can help you out, then. I listened to Jeff &amp; Judd's democast today and had never heard of Best Friends before. It sounds very neat. The character generation is ingenious and awesome: it seemed to me you could actually hear the 'click' in Judd's brain after everybody pushed tokens to his PC "Spiderweb" (btw, wtf Judd?) because everybody thinks she's the coolest, and Judd says, "but I can't push a Cool token because nobody's cooler than me," and Malcolm? Gregor? (whoever was running the demo) says, "no, there's always somebody cooler than you" and everybody realizes that no matter how many people think the goth chick is the height of cool, SHE thinks somebody else - the air-head rich girl? - is cooler... And you can hear the click as suddenly Judd sees that his PC is a LOT more complex than even he gave her credit for, because why does she think that? There MUST be a story there.... and it becomes clear that the rules aren't just a clever way of generating everybody's scores, they're a way of instantly building a seething twisted mess of insecurities, where nobody can ever see their own best qualities.</p>
<p>Or maybe that click was in MY head.</p>
<p>(Now, the demo didn't give me any sense of how longer stories would work in this game, or what kinds of situations and stories you would tell, or how the characters ever interact with the rest of the world, if they do at all. But you can't do everything in a demo, and the demo sold me on one super keen idea.)</p>

                            Yeh, I'm totally stealing chargen from Best Friends. It is so freaking slick, I can't stand it.<br/><br/>I actually wish that the Mortal Coil demo had had more of what I really dig about the game, creating the setting through the use of Magic Tokens. But hey, you can't do everything in a demo. Jye, the fact that your token splitting is hidden makes it very tactical as to whether you split actions or not. If you split your actions into two attacks, at least one of them will probably get through, unless the other person splits his to do two defenses - but the one that gets through won't be as potent. Or you could stack everything one on passion and hope to sledgehammer through. Or you could defend and attack...and so on. The more opponents, and the more you pile on passions, the trickier it gets. There's definitly a learning curve to how to and when to split actions.                        </div>

Thanks very much for the praise, but I actually think that entire demo was totally down to the players. it was you guys who shouted "Imperial concubines in ancient China!" and "It's the funeral of the Empress and her son!" and set the entire comedy-drama in motion. I can't really take credit for any of it, if truth be known. However, it was an immensely fun demo and great to be part of (I'll get the AP written up as best as I can remember). Then again, Best Friends is an awesome game that just creates great play. Gregors demo with myself, Ron and John all playing bridesmaids on the day before the wedding was brilliant and very pointed. <br/><br/>That's one of the many great things about BF: right from the off, you are creating story. No timewasting or shilly-shallying, from the very start of things, the story begins to evolve. And it all starts with the Best Character Creation Mechanic Evar.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>

<br/>
OK, I think I'm getting it.  It seems like the natural tendency would be for a lot of "hits" to happen, which are somewhat but not entirely mitgated by defence - or you can choose to take whatever comes in order to get one thing you're really comitted to through.<br/>
<br/>
That probably works for post-apocalypse pulp sorcery Mars... :)                        </div>

                            I am glad people are liking the Democasts.  I'll echo Malcom here, but one of the things I most enjoyed about Best Friends is the way you create characters.  I am not sure if any other games use anything like it, but I think it would be interesting.  I love the idea of running a stereotypical D&amp;D style game where you are allowed to briefly describe your character, then all of your stats are determined by what the other players think of it.  Or maybe I was just keen on Gregor's suggestion that the Fellowship of the Ring could be played using Best Friends.  Legolas is prettier than me.                        </div>

I'd be wary of it for long games, but I think having other players authoring bits of your character sheet is a technique that has a lot of cool applications.<br/>
<br/>
I'm leaning towards an idea for my little Last Exile game whereby you create your own character, but the other players give you your "crew" - the NPCs who look up to and support you.                        </div>
