                    So, my game Agon has been out for a while now. People are playing it, and consequently are handling the book (It's a 9x7 landscape softcover). For those of you that have it, I'd love to hear honest criticism about the size, the binding, and generally how the format "feels" in use. Mine is the only game book of this format, as far as I know, and I'm curious about how it's being received.<br/><br/>I'd also like to talk about this as a more general issue. Which book sizes most appeal to you? Is there a connection between book format and content, in your opinion? What are some physical book qualities that turn you on, and which ones turn you off?                </div>

<p>It is difficult to shelve, but very beautiful and a pleasure to read. I would worry that it is awkward to flip through (it is, a little) if it were a book I needed to reference a lot during play, but as this isn't so much the case, it doesn't bother me.</p>
<p>I like books that are sorta thick - I would prefer a book to have smaller pages and a more substantial spine, something that I can <em>find</em> on the shelf, and not worry as much about getting beaten up in my bag. I like books with generous margins, and ones that don't feel overly formal - I should be comfortable with writing in it, and the layout should invite and permit that.</p>

                            I like smaller books over bigger ones, dimension wise. I like digest over letter, and if you can get it smaller than digest and still have it practical, I like that even better. For some reason I also seem to prefer horizontal layout books to vertical ones, but I think that might just be me. <br/><br/>I like books that have had some forethought into how they are going to be used and handled, such as easy to find sections and nice friendly layout. If the book looks like it's usable, that's a turn on. Books that don't look like any sort of thought about someone picking the book up and reading it, then that's a turn off. Text that vanishes into the spine or horrible fonts, for example, as well as bindings that come apart as soon as you open them!                        </div>

                            Here's what I like, for format.<br/><br/>One topic per page, starting at the top of the page, with a minimum of page-to-page overflow.<br/><br/>When a given topic starts three lines from the bottom of a page, and takes up the whole next page, I get pissy about it, because it makes it harder to reference that topic in the book - and the more it happens, the more aggravating it is to find stuff in the book.                        </div>

And of course Burning Empires just feels so <i>right</i>. I think that works well because subconciously it's a shape and format that we're familiar with - the novel size and length.                        </div>

                            i think paper stock is really important. its what you feel as your reading, if pages are soft and runny (like inkjet paper, or regretably i think a lot of the xeroxy stuff you get from PODs) it has a certain weakness that i don't like. The slickness and sharp edge really relates to the space opera stuff in burning empire. The buff colored paper in Burning Wheel has a nice older book/story book feel that gives an assist to that games genre and tone.<br/><br/>Artifact is supremly important in my mind, how a book is made can directly relate to what a book is about, and the physicality of the object is one of the best ways we can connect with it as readers.                        </div>

                            AGON is an incredible piece of size and layout. There is one flaw, though:<br/>
<br/>
The softcover plastic-paper cover thing is sprayed or laminated with that anti-UV stuff. What happens is, with use, the game gets oily noticable fingerprints all over it. They stand out even more since the book is black.  That's why I was thinking that if I publish through Lulu, I'll probably go for their "thick paper cover" option until they get that UV stuff right...<br/>

                            John, we were actually just talking about Agon at our last playtest circle.  I really, really like the format; I find it very flippable and a very friendly format.  The borders, line art, and use of white space give it a very open feel.  It actually feels less like a "roleplaying book" and more like "a book describing a game."<br/><br/>One slightly amusing note is that, with that open sort of look, and with the greek gods and goddesses in line art, the book keeps looking and feeling like one of those books on greek mythology that you might find in a middle school classroom -- the kind that I, personally, used to love to find and devour.  I don't know if that was intentional, but it's a big plus for me -- it's saying, "Remember those slightly kooky stories about heroes that you used to read instead of do schoolwork?  This game is about that."  And that's pretty cool.<br/><br/>As for the cover, yeah.  Black covers are almost universally a bad idea, especially when you're talking softcover.  This can be somewhat alleviated by using a texture (see every single World of Darkness fatsplat ever), which will obscure the prints.<br/><br/>I'm really digging on the small-format books.  I find them far more natural and friendly than the unweildy 8.5x11 game books of my youth.  The only drawback is for games that really need to be referenced often in play, the small formats and especially the digest make it hard to impossible to lay the book out on the table open-faced.  That said, I have a couple copies of <em>Capes</em> that I printed four-up and had comb-bound, and they are just startlingly useful and convenient to use.  I'm sorely tempted to do Agora in that format, although the nice thing about Lulu (where full-color Agora will be going) is I can offer the same book in multiple formats, so this is less of an issue.                        </div>

                            Hi John,<br/><br/>The book layout has been very useful for play.  It's very easy to leave open to a page, without the book closing itself, like some of the smaller books tend to do.  This makes it easy for two people sitting next to each other to reference the same page, which is good for character generation.  Likewise, flippability helps in referencing it.<br/><br/>Though folks are complaining about the black for the fingerprints, it looks like a coffee table book and immediately draws people in.  Everyone I've shown it to really digs the appearance.<br/><br/>Also- was Frank Miller's 300 an influence on the format size?  It's kind of cool to hand both books over to someone to look through at the same time.                        </div>

                            I'm really into the idea of doing a hardcover book with very few pages, like a classic children's book (The Polar Express!) or something that looks good on your coffeetable.

I've been thinking of something similar, and trying to hash out the cost involved. I wouldn't mind finding out a bit more about what the cost would come in at for  adding a good bit of color to those pages, either.<br/><br/>Lxndr:<br/>I've seen some books recently that appeared to have a coil bining inside of a hardcover ( the coil only showed when the book was open-it actually looked very functional).

                            In brief, I love that all of the indie publishers are playing with format and style. I've never been sure that the standard 8.5" x 11" was the most appropriate, and experimentation is good even if it comes at the expense of stocking hassles. After all, we are all selling more and more via the internet. RPGs are unique products and deserve a format tailored to them.                        </div>

                            I'm considering formats for the pilgrimage game I'm tinkering with at the moment. I'll probably release the game for free, but if it's not too much work, I could try doing a limited run of printed "deluxe" versions. One format I considered was a <a href="http://www.cailun.info/uploads/terminologies/stabsample_ch.jpg" rel="nofollow">hand-stitched japanese book-binding</a>.

                            I also prefer coil-binding in my books. But the market tells me that, given the choice, people will buy the perfectbound over the coilbound.

I absolutely love how PUSH uses the square format to great advantage (marginalia, baby!), and I want to do something in square very soon.

                            Thanks for the Agon feedback, folks. I appreciate it.<br/><br/>I totally agree that format, paper, binding and all that should fit the content of the product. Stuff like Shock:, PUSH, and especially Primitive are great examples of cool non-standard formats. I'd like to use the wide 9x7 format again for an upcoming project (or possibly square like PUSH), but it really should be hardcover. Maybe Lulu will offer that in the future.<br/><br/>Nathan: I love the idea of a dustjacket with info inside. It could be produced in a way to function as a "GM screen" or reference of some kind. Or a place for color maps, maybe.<br/><br/>I'm also hoping that POD card decks will become easier to produce soon. Games presented as a custom set of cards could be a very good thing.                        </div>

Interestingly enough, this has actually been done (though it's MUCH cheaper in Japan): An indie designer was selling his game in scroll-format at the Comiket a few years ago for like $5.00 a pop. THe game was a huge hand-to-hand strategy martial arts game in the vein of Street Fighter or Thrash.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

My experience with coil binding is still influenced by the weird zig-zag wire coil binding on the computer manuals of my youth.  Especially the old Apple IIe stuff.  Here are my particular issues with coil bound:
<ul>
<li>the pages turn only with difficulty because they have to slide along the coil</li>
<li>the holes wear until pages begin to fall out</li>
<li>the tops and bottoms of the binding wear and look scruffy</li>
<li>the zig-zag means that you can't fold the pages over easily</li>
<li>when open the book looks mis-aligned</li>
<li>all you can see on the shelf is the coil</li>
</ul>
Now, more recent plastic coils overcome most of these issues (especially the wear issue), but not all.  <cite>1984 Prime</cite> still disappears into my shelf, which is probably the worst thing I can say about it - otherwise it's a cool game.<br/><br/>The other thing that continues to confuse me: O'Reilly has been publishing books in a lay-flat binding for a long time now, and no one seems to want to emulate that.  It's essentially a perfect binding, with a flexible spine and a separation between the cover and the spine.  Word from them is that they don't hold any patent or anything, but I'm sure there's opinions about the lay-flat as well...                        </div>

                            Lay-flat perfect binding is pretty expensive, as bindings go.  It's more complicated, with more moving parts, and it's relatively difficult to produce since the glues need to stick to that part and not this part and so on.  I suspect O'Reilly gets enough utility out of it to justify the cost.                        </div>

                            If someone makes the keychain RPG, I would recommend making the book(let) itself something like a keychain. I'm imagining maybe five-to-ten sturdy pages with rounded corners. A large, grommeted hole is punched in the top left corner of the whole stack and are fastened together with the very carabiner that you use in the game.                        </div>

                            No no -- the book has, like, six holes down the side, right?  Only one ring needs to stay in to keep the book together.  The other five can be removed and used by five separate players.                        </div>

<p>Judson, and everyone else considering a spiral-bound book:</p>
<p>You can't see them on a shelf. They don't look good when they're for sale. Just yesterday I was looking for my copy of PTA and I had to take out every spiral bound game (4 or 5) to find it. (I have the first ed.)</p>
<p>They lay flat for play and they're durable. Great. But that's moot if you don't want to buy it in the first place and you don't see it on the shelf to remind you of it.</p>
<p>I propose that anyone considering this do it as an alternate printing and give the customer the option. I want to do a pocket-sized edition of Shock: and I'd consider doing a spiral bound one, too. But I'm not printing many even if I do it. Maybe I'd be surprised. My guess is, no.</p>

                            I was about to suggest a combination of coil binding with a dust jacket to deal with the lack of shelf/spine recognition. Unfortunately, the extra cost of the dust jacket would probably off-set any savings you'd get using the coil binding in the first place. What about a comb binding?                        </div>

                            I think spiral binding may be less of a sales-killer if your primary sales venue is online, where the browser can see the cover anyway.<br/><br/>But yes, spiral bound does tend to get lost on the bookshelf.<br/><br/>I dig the way the original Trinity (by White Wolf) was bound, when it was first released (and still called Aeon). It had a red spiral binding, but was contained within this kind of black plastic shell, like if a dust jacket was made of hard plastic, and the red coil poked out the center of the shell. So it had definite width and presence on the shelf, and it lay flat on the table as well.I bet that would be expensive, but it was mad cool.<br/><br/>Perhaps one could get narrow ribbons made with the game name on them, vertically, and then thread it through the spiral binding so you can see it on the shelf. Or just something bright, so it stands out. Timestream coilbound has a blue binding, and it's easy to differentiate from the other coils.<br/><br/>My love for spiral binding hath no bounds!                        </div>

<p>There's no cost savings in coil binding when printing through a POD. They cost the same on Lulu as perfect and I promise you'd lose sales.</p>
<p>There's a neat technique of spiral/jacket binding that few seem able to do. It still damages other books on the shelf, but it looks better than the regular spiral.</p>

                            The actual content of the book tells me if I want coil-bound or perfect. <br/><br/>A game with many tables that I will reference frequently MUST be coil bound so that it can be left open. A game with few tables or rules I can just as easily hold in my head is better perfect bound so it can be found by it's spine when I need to dig it out to check on it. Quick reference sheets can reduce the need for either, but they are necessary if you've perfect bound a book with more than a few look-up tables.<br/><br/>My ideal book-as-artifact layout for Contract Work is a landscaped letter format in Boston Screw binding with a hard cover. Cover graphics printed portrait and the game title printed on the page edges through a full bleed so that it is visible from the side. The goal  is to emulate an old-fashioned financial ledger. This will never happen.                        </div>

Yeah, that was neat. When I was using the book, though, I had to be extra-cautious about flipping through -- I tore a page or two accidentally. Even the pages that didn't rip wore out over time.                        </div>
