Not everyone wants to "firewall" their IC/OOC knowledge (thanks for that phrase Kev!), and sometimes people will slip up and say something in character that they shouldn't have (or do it willfully in the case of someone who is a jerk). On the other hand, table secrets can make the other players feel as though they are being left out of the game to some degree, especially if there is any sort of note passing or leaving the room to discuss things. In an experienced group I feel like everyone having the secret allows other players to inform their play such that it adds heightened tension and weight to scenes where that secret can come into play.</blockquote>\n<br/>I posited the question over on the Social Table Rules thread, and Jason pointed out (rightly!) that it maybe didn't belong there.  So here it is.<br/><br/>Personally, I prefer an open game.  I like to be allowed to interact with someone else's character secret during play, and I always feel a little left out when the player and the GM start passing notes to each other during the game.  I also have horrible memories of the backstabby bullshit I've had to deal with in crappy DnD games, where the Rogue is stealing my shit behind my back and the LG guy who is secretly LE is setting us up for a fall without our consent.<br/><br/>Basically, I feel that table secrecy is only appropriate when there is competitive play happening at the table; otherwise, I think it's inappropriate and takes away from the collaborative play style that I prefer.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211650/#Comment_211650" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T12:12:26+00:00" title="June 11, 2009 12:12PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like 95% transparency for us.

Me and my groups enjoy about 5% Transparency.  Here's what we do and why...<br/><br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  <br/>Rule Number One...  In dealing with any and ALL secret information at the table each player must understand that said info should never be crucial or problematic to the game in such a way that the secret (when revealed) will break the fun of the campaign.  We can't have anything that would break the game or PC group immediately.  I encourage juicy secrets that would bring about lively role-playing, but it can't be so secret that it will drive the party apart.  <br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  <br/>All PC background secrets are kept private between GM and player.<br/><br/>This even (sometimes) includes keeping character things like "Cohorts" or "Followers" (in D&amp;D3.5) private/unknown to other players to BE another PC's character.  The reason that I do this, is to introduce this NPC as an NPC first - then later when the other players do learn that this NPC is a direct stat connection to another PC we've already established that NPC as an "individual".  Many times if we introduce an NPC that's connected to a PC from a stat "purchase" players tend to ignore the "importance" of that NPC since its "just his cohort" and wouldn't have any info we need or a reason to roleplay with.  If established as an NPC first it creates a solid character first then is a fun surprise when realized as a stat-NPC.<br/><br/>I tend to build WIKI Campaign Bibles for all my games... with that I make a section for PCs.  On this section I preload all the info I can (basic name, race, etc..) for the players and make a special new page (click on the PCs name) so the player can input any background story, etc...  I usually load a blank "template" of questions and such for format for each player to make it simple, plug-n-play.  Generally this Wiki-page is open to all players to read and enjoy if they're interested in the creation/writing another player's done for their character.  So... I also make a PRIVATE-EYES-ONLY Wiki page that each player can post private info from their background for myself and them to update.  This page is linked to the player's NAME.<br/><br/>Secret Player Character background, you ask?  Yeah - if a player wants I welcome them to come up with their "dark past" or secrets that they're part of... from villains in their background to origins to organizations they're a part of, etc... <br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.  <br/>My groups enjoy keeping any info their character shouldn't know secret.  So if there's a spot check... they don't want to know if their character wouldn't.  If info is in a game book that their character wouldn't know, they don't want to read it and don't want other players "spoiling" it for them.  This is primarily for the rush of role-playing with the true info their PC has and enjoying learning in-character.<br/>One "newer" thing we've incorporated by player request is to NOT tell the group aloud what spell you're casting or power you're using.  Rather the player gives a fun description (sometimes a canny player can tell which spell's being cast from the description!)  and at the same time hand a wipe-board to the GM to note:  what the name of the spell is and any important info like Saving Throw needed, etc...  Then if any other PC that has knowledge of such things wants to know what was just cast - they can roll a Spellcraft check (or whatever's appropriate) and if they get the roll we show them the wipe-board.<br/>So if something needs to be passed along privately from GM to player or even player to player, my group either:  makes liberal use of 4-5 small marker-wipe-boards I have (I usually hand one to each player at the beginning of the game)   OR  we take the conversation to the hallway in front of my apt where we play.

I've made practice to enjoy "private scenes" with individual players to impart any info that's too long to write on a wipe-board  OR  to do any conversations that are private between PC and an NPC.  This could be from pre-arranged meetings to gathering information in town.  We walk into my hallway and role-play the scene as needed.  There's an important RULE here -  I do my best to promise that no single private conversation will last more than 5 minutes.  And as I leave the other players I try to always leave them with something to do, consider, or a topic to role-play between players, etc...  Or even just knowledge of what scene is coming next or to plan for action/initiative when I return.  Many times I'll start the game in the hallway going from player to player individually for 2-3 minutes each to invite questions or to give info they should have to start the game session.  <br/>Sometimes players will actually have hallway conversations together when info or a scene is private from another PC.  <br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>.  <br/>Blue-Books...  Like Hallway conversations we keep these private to only the PCs involved.  Blue-Books are scenes that we do between game sessions to flesh out any NPCs or situations that the player is interested in doing.  If a player wants they can post a new page for the scene to take place on our Wiki.  This private scene continues much like a play-by-post from there on.  If multiple PCs are involved in the private Blue-Book and one player character needs private info  (like info on a Knowledge skill they have)  I will usually make a link to a new private page that details any info they have.  Then they can use that info to talk from their voice and point of view if they want to share their knowledge. <br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a>.  <br/>Player Secrets from the GM....  This is a big one that most GMs wouldn't be comfy with.  I invite my players to keep plans or events secret even from me as GM.  If they know a battle's coming, I welcome them to chat privately to plan tactics, etc...  There's two BIG caveats here:  a. the secret info shouldn't be "game breaking", if the info is important enough that it may endanger the actual status of the game changning things in such a large way it cannot be secret - for example if the other players have decided to execute one of the other PCs... the GM needs to know!  b. spells and effects that are game rule specific need to be told to the GM.  Many times an NPC or PC may have ways of sensing/knowing what is happening, so we can't have a spell/effect secret if the character should be able to react.<br/>Why do I allow secrets from the GM?  I really enjoy the ad-libbing for role-play and reactions at the game table.  I've planned out many many of the ideas that happen from the plot, the world, NPCs, and other events - so in a way I get bored if I don't have surprises in-game.  I love when the game takes a radical new direction and I have to "work" off the top-of-my-head to come up with responses.  It's fun for me.   The key here is as GM you really really need to know the NPCs well... you need to know their though processes and potential reactions.  If you don't consider each NPC as a "real person" it's very challenging (and unfun) to ad-lib.<br/><br/><br/><br/>so....<br/>FIREWALLING<br/>Absolutely, I understand that many/most players are mature enough to firewall info their character shouldn't react on...  And even with my level of secrecy in games we STILL have a good share of firewalling that we use.  But knowing that we CAN be mature enough to firewall and enjoying doing it is completely different.  <br/>The majority of my players and myself  LOVE  the surprises that happen from the neatest most unexpected places  (Many times I've heard player-to-player say:  "holy crap! you can do *THAT*?!?!?! - awesome! heheheh...").<br/>Most of my players also tend to enjoy not needing to *think* what to firewall and not to firewall,  not knowing simply makes it easier for them to enjoy digging into their character for that immersion flavor.<br/><br/><br/>Like I said... I'm really surprised that more Story Gamers don't actively enjoy keeping private stuff private.  huh...<br/>Any thoughts on my notes as to why you like the idea or why not?<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_211763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211763/#Comment_211763" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T17:28:14+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  5:28PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2009 5:28PM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends, but the main principle is open interaction.

Then they can use that info to talk from their voice and point of view if they want to share their knowledge.<br/><br/>I do something simular (email, one shots, private scenes) but I dont have make a secret of it, nor do I hide it, or its results. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a>.<br/>Player Secrets from the GM.... This is a big one that most GMs wouldn't be comfy with. I invite my players to keep plans or events secret even from me as GM...<br/><br/>sometimes I'll leave the room/give people their privacy, mostly because the players sometimes fear that I will change facts to accomodate their plan to get my own way. Mostly it is because sometimes the whole transparancy thing is not helpful ( i can give too much or not needed information as easily as useful sometimes, threw no fault of my own) I run trad and the idea of gm&lt;-&gt; player antagonism comes from that. Many of my players think that I seek out to kill them every session (I hope they think at least I stick to the rules) and they seem to enjoy the two way struggle. I'm often just happy that they at the very least have cohessively come together in some fashion (even if it against the out to kill the player's gm)<br/><br/>Our positions are not really that different, just probably that i've had several burns using some of the technicques you use, and dont think they are worth the payoff. That said I dont get immersion (even in larps I dont get that whole idea of being in someone elses state of mind or whatever you want to say, immersion is not even on the playing field as far as im concerned) which may also account for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211776/#Comment_211776" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T18:13:07+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  6:13PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the notion of secrecy is inherently tied into a particular perspective on "immersion."

In this game, one player plays the Hero and everybody else plays a Faction in the current situation.  One of the Factions is aligned with the Witch King; one of the Factions is opposed.  All of the Factions have objectives that point at each other, and generally call for fucking each other's shit up.  The Faction players set all of this up with the Hero player in the other room.  Then the Hero player comes in and play begins with the Hero player walking into the situation completely clueless.  It produces a really neat frission and makes playing that Hero feel really dangerous and paranoid.<br/><br/>So my answer is: 100% when we're collaborating on a story; other values when the game uses secrecy in interesting ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211779/#Comment_211779" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T18:16:31+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  6:16PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>I used to treat character information as private and allowed a fair bit of secret information passing, too, but then I discovered one my new players was cheating, so I altered my approach. Everything is now public (character sheets, dice rolls including the GM's, etc.), but it's still good form to ask before looking at another's character sheet.</blockquote>\n<br/>Cheating... huh... My theory on cheating is that it's too bad a player resorts to that to have fun... BUT... if that's how THAT player has fun I generally don't stand in the way.  <br/>Wha-wha-WHA?!?!?  You ask...  <br/>Yep - my feeling is, if you cheat and that's how you enjoy the game - I don't care.  Even if I notice.  My IMPORTANT caveat is that I will not allow a cheating player to CHEAT another player - so if a player's cheating ways effects another player directly I figure out a way to not allow it.  Otherwise my feeling is that as GM I have tons of ways to "combat" a cheater without calling them on it - and reducing their fun (again, it stinks that cheating seems fun to some but I deal with it).  <br/>As GM I can increase the threats or increase the difficulty of die rolls, etc... for that player's character and not effect the overall game.  This comes from my old practice as a kid for knowing our neighborhood had  x  number of people to play kickball or whatever, if I wanted to play sometimes we'd have to invite the crappy kid we wouldn't invite if given a choice...  Take that to growing up dealing with crap so that I can enjoy a game and that's why I deal with cheating players.<br/><br/>So let'em cheat.  <br/>My "favorite" cheater was a player I used to game with alot who was very overweight... he would lounge back on my couch with a die-tray on his belly that he would roll his dice in (rather than lean up to the table)  he'd always have all his dice in the tray and when called to roll, he'd just kind of swish the die-tray around, continuing to swish if the die didn't come up with what he wanted, never showing anyone the dice.  His approach was funny - he'd NEVER "roll" a maxed out score  (a Natural 20)  but he'd also never roll a failure.  He generally would say the die roll was somewhere slightly above average that would allow him to succeed the majority of the time.  His cheating was brought to my attention by another player...  since another player cared I made a new rule for that game:  When rolling dice you have to have a rolling-buddy", meaning another player to witness the die roll.<br/><br/><br/>On secret vs. hidden die rolls...  I generally ask all my players to roll on the table in front of everyone.  I have one player that religiously rolls dice in his open game book - I allow it since it's his superstition.  I also came to the enjoyment of rolling (almost) every GM die roll on the table as well.  This makes it impossible to "fudge" die rolls - but I look at this as a good thing.  Not only does it prevent me from fudging for the NPCs  (and thereby forces me to THINK creatively and deal with the die roll in-story)  but it also is very very exciting for the game to watch an important GM die roll happen.<br/>Example - last Saturday in my D&amp;D game we had a Save-vs-SlayLiving spell cast on a major NPC and longtime villain.  It was a Fortitude Saving Throw or he was DEAD. This was a major NPC that was way over the PC's power level, and they got unbelievably lucky to get in a situation to cast said spell...  So... I rolled on the table in front of the group!  I revved up my special DM d20 and spun it from my hand - it took like 5-10 seconds spinning (literally) before rolling a NATURAL 1 !!!   Super super exciting for the player group!!  And exciting for me, in that I then had to think quick and deal with the outcomes of this massive blow to the bad guys and story (in a good way).<br/><br/><br/>My group also has character sheets generally "open" as we post them on the files section or open on the PC Wiki page.  So anyone could download any sheet if they wanted.  But yeah... generally it's unspoken for fellow players to not download and "check" other player's character sheets.  They're up and "open" more for the GM and for printing if you forget your character sheet than open for others to read.  <br/>Funny thing... I've USED this in the past when a player wants to secretly be/do something - have them upload their character sheet with the "false" info on it.  The best I remember using this was in a Vampire game.  Those old Vampire Character Sheets you could copy from the back of the Clan Books used to have the name of the Clan at the top.  One of my PCs was secretly pretending to be a Brujah when he was actually playing another rival clan.  He used the Brujah clan sheet to make his character assuming that other players would "glance" at his sheet and see the name of his "fake" clan (Brujah) and assume he was legit.  It worked like a charm and even though I laid heavy clues as the Storyteller that he was impersonating a Brujah, the other players didn't question it.  heheh...<br/><br/>When he was found out  (only after the campaign ended)  by the other players it was a riot!!<br/>Awesome fun.<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211784/#Comment_211784" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T18:46:02+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  6:46PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I think the notion of secrecy is inherently tied into a particular perspective on "immersion."

I do have friends who have desperately wanted to play in a campaign or setting I'm GMing, then play 3-4 games and HATE the style.  Not that I can't or won't change my style (my ligher-hearted supers game is almost completely above-board with transparency),  but when I go into a campaign that screams for me to insert such secrecy I want to USE that as a tool for delving into social interaction.<br/><br/>My two most recent and best examples for this (for my groups) are both D&amp;D3.5 games.  Which seem odd when D&amp;D is generally looked at as dungeon crawls first, in-depth immersion and social interaction distant second:<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  MIDNIGHT - Fantasy Flight's dark "What is Sauron won?" type setting.  I pushed secrecy in this campaign because the overall one-word theme was PARANOIA.  For the setting, no one could be trusted - even player characters had to earn the trust of one another.  This was definately challenging at times but in my experience (a 2 year campaign) it made a very vibrant socially interactive and immersive game.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  IRON KINGDOMS - Privateer Press' steampunky fantasy setting.  This is my current weekly "deep" campaign. We use secrecy primarily because of the one-word theme I'm using (inherent in the setting) of COLD-WAR style spy type anxiety of a word on the brink of war where information is truly power.   <br/><br/><br/>...so...<br/>Paul - riddle me this...  <br/>While I agree with you that the notion of secrecy can be tied into a particular perspective on immersion.  <br/>Is that perspective bad?  Can one not enjoy that?  <br/>As I noted my group (at least) completely knows that we don't NEED to have secrecy for immersion.  It's a game, we're mature enough to know to keep in-character separate from out-of-character info and visca-versa.  However, we think its just more fun to not know...  To act and react as your character would.  Its not that we can't act if we have that secret info, not that we can't firewall the info.  It's just more exciting (for some people) to do so without.<br/><br/>Your tone makes me (at first) feel like you consider my players "want" to enjoy secrets and not-firewalling information as something less mature.  That players CAN'T have the level of "social interaction" you mention without having that secret knowledge.  <br/>Your reply seems like you're saying you can have ONE or the OTHER.  <br/>The priority for social interaction  OR  a specific sense of immersion.<br/>I don't believe that's true at all.  In my experience, the social interaction my groups experience are excelled by the lack of transparency.<br/><br/><br/>So my question... (for Paul or anyone)<br/>You note "the benefits of radical transparency greatly outweighed the benefits of trying to create a you-are-there psychological state via incomplete information and real-world secrecy."<br/><br/>What are the KEY POINTS that any kind of transparency actually give benefit and outweigh the actual in-character information (ie. not having the secrets)?  <br/><br/><br/>To understand your point I need some data points to consider.  What are some examples that make more transparency better than less transparency?  What are benefits that are EXCLUSIVE to high transparency?<br/>Because it's easy to see the major benefit that is exclusive to low transparency:  You just don't have the info to even consider firewalling or not.<br/><br/><br/>Again - I'm not replying in a confrontational manner.  But I did feel a little like your tone:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>No really, Kev, I spent a good long time playing<i>exactly</i>the way you just described.</blockquote>\nSeemed a little greater-than-thou in tone... Like you've move on from "that" style of play...<br/><br/>But I stepped back and thought I'm probably reading into it a bit much.  It's just a different style and I know from experience that there are many different ways to enjoy games.  I just don't agree that transparency or social interaction or immersion are connected or exclusive to one another.<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211788/#Comment_211788" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T19:03:16+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  7:03PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a thought I've had recently.....  <br/>That involves the need/want for transparency a great deal.<br/><br/>See what others think.<br/><br/>I've noticed that my friends that have families or other life concerns that take them away from enjoying putting more time into games seem to (need to?) play with a style of HIGHER Transparency as well as playing games in a more episodic style and/or playing a great deal of one-shots (as opposed to campaigns).  I've also experienced alot of folks that play the more Indy Games and/or convention style games seem to have lives that reduce their time to spend on the hobby as wanting a higher degree of transparency.<br/><br/>Now... I'm not saying that's bad.  What I'm saying is I've noticed a great divide between my friends (and posters on forums like Story Gamers) that seem to enjoy higher transparency as well as games that tend toward the narrative-style rules because they have higher priorities from life that demand that time.  Their priorities changed.<br/><br/>And that's fine.<br/><br/>But it's good to acknowledge that their IS a difference.<br/><br/>I'm not saying folks like myself (a bachelor with little responsibility at current)  have a "better" degree of gaming.  But I do have the "luxury" of spending time on my hobby as I want, as opposed to having a smaller set time to "fit it in".  So that allows me and a good portion of my gamer friends to build a more intense, immersive, socially interactive games with political plots and mysteries on a deeper level than the dungeon or mystery of the week.  Time can be devoted to a mystery/plot that takes 8 game sessions to play out...  And those gamer friends can also notch out a time to devote to the campaign - for (in my case) a 6-12 hour weekly game, every Saturday. <br/><br/>Am I saying it's impossible to have a more immersive or socially interactive game without that time to devote or with a higher degree of transparency?  NO.  But I would say it's more challenging to force to happen as opposed to having it be natural.  I can sit down and enjoy myself forcing a role-play of a character with knowing secret info or playing a character I've never played before and likely won't ever play again... and I can enjoy that.  But it's much much easier to come to a game/character that I've built a consistent personality for and have the exact knowledge they do (less Transparency),  its much easier to let that social interaction happen if I don't have to consciously work at the role-play...<br/><br/><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211794/#Comment_211794" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T19:16:38+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  7:16PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have come to love the transparency and I can't see going back.

That element is not present in my thinking.<br/><br/>You don't need to defend your position, at all. I meant what I said -- I played this way for a helluva long time. I wouldn't have done that if I didn't like the result.<br/><br/>I like the results of radical transparency even more <i>in my play.</i> No idea what your play is like.\n<blockquote>So my question...

If everyone's talking openly, they can bring up issues they have with the situation they're not buying, or introduce other and maybe better ideas. Yes, there's a whole layer of social maneuvering going on. I'd say the level of trust you have to have in that kind of game group is on-par with the level of trust players need with their GM in a high-immersion high-secrets game.<br/><br/>* In my experience, blurring the line between player and character can potentially lead to some very ugly interpersonal results. I would much rather two players agree that it'd be fun for their characters to have a fight than two have two players get into a fight. I say this as a guy who has engineered such a result via high-secrecy, high-buyin GMing style. I think weird things happen to our heads when that line gets too blurry. I used to be a hardcore immersion-uber-alles guy, but the past maybe decade-or-so I've been thinking maybe that kind of immersion isn't healthy or productive. I know that's going to sound controversial; we can get into the "does deep immersion cause brain damage?" question in a different thread.<br/><br/>* With more information, players can make more informed decisions about authorship-type elements of play. This has led, in my play, to some really neat results. More brains = mo betta ideas. That, to me, is the secret sauce of radical transparency -- I think authorial-style play comes hand-in-hand with it.<br/><br/>Those are just the first three that popped to mind.\n<blockquote>Again - I'm not replying in a confrontational manner.

Like you've move on from "that" style of play...<br/><br/>But I stepped back and thought I'm probably reading into it a bit much.

Everyone just needs to consider each thing with the overall campaign in mind rather than only with their character in mind.  Kind of the act locally, think globally of role-play gaming.  heheh...<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>You mean that if one of your players ooc showed some interest in the backstories of his fellows, you would actively deny that information. Wouildn't jive with me. If one of my players is showing interest, i do everything I can to fan that interest, if that means giving more info if that's what they are interested in, they get it.</blockquote>\n<br/>As GM - I don't actively deny anything from player to player.  But I respect the wishes of each player and ask each to do the same.  <br/>I *get* that its great for the energy of the game if any player CRAVES more info to read/enjoy about the campaign.  That's very important.  But I also know that it can be immensely fun if the private info is aloud to be carried out and discovered in-game.<br/>Same said with GM info...  <br/>A player may be super excited about the game world -  and I WANT to fan that flame.  I 100% agree with you.  But what I try to do is fan that flame in such a way as to keep the excitement and interest while maintaining the "secret" info.  <br/><br/>For Example:  if a player suspects another PC as being a part of a secret organization that they've heard mentioned in-game, and that player knows a smidgeon of info about that secret organization... RATHER than telling the player to read his fellow's info or to be welcome to read secret info in the game book - I would rather start a private scene with their character that helps fan their interest-flame.  Like having another NPC approach them worried about the same thing, or an NPC from that secret group!  etc.. etc...  Fan the flame by using the interest to create another sub-plot storyline for that player character alone.  Give hints to the other PC's (or game world) secrets without giving away the farm.  Plant seeds of truth with seeds of rumor.  Soon that other player is now asking questions and going on leads, that the character harboring that secret needs to actively role-play or work on - whether that be to continue to hide the info or to make the reveal! <br/><br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>just kinda on a practical note, the things you would/should read change from character to character if your playing the same system more or less more than once, and as such, its first impossible to prevent people from 'reading' what they should not have.</blockquote>\n<br/><br/>No its not.  <br/>Why is it "impossible" to request that players NOT read something?  <br/>It's a request.<br/>And while it's not 100%... most mature players will respect a GM request or ruling.<br/><br/>As GM you can enforce this strongly  (subtracting Experience Points from that player for doing what you asked them not to)  or  simply make the request and if the player ignores you ask again...  But in a way you're right... You can't prevent people from getting the info if they want it - short of taking all the books or info and hiding it from them.<br/><br/>And if that's the case.  If a player doesn't want to respect your request... there's not much you can do,  you just have to decide how strongly you want to enforce that request then allow whatever else to happen.  cest la vi<br/><br/>But, come-on... If I'm gaming with someone that's not respectful or mature enough to honor my request as GM to not look at something... Either I've willingly decided to deal with it or I need to make a decision if I really want to game with this immaturity further.<br/><br/><br/>**continued**                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211803/#Comment_211803" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T19:54:06+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  7:54PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>but in many cases table talk is half the fun of the game. Also this expressly disadvantagious to some people. I got a doctor in my group who threw a combination of being a bit timid and new to the game litterally asks about everything before he does it (mostly with the other players). A scenario like that would litterally stop him like a deer in trainlights. Lastly does this add much to the game except omg what did they say/talk about. and As far as im concerned , that's not actually adding to the game.</blockquote>\n<br/><br/>Three points for your three points.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  table talk IS one of the most fun things in role-playing games, but my groups have used this time to expand on that... if you're not the one for the hallway conversation many times you'll be continuing cool table-talk of your own (in private from that other player).  AND when the person returns any info they learned privately is usually the BIG topic of conversation (either immediately after or in the game's future),  and it's even more fun because that table-talk of sharing info is picked and chosen for what they want to reveal and it comes from their character's unique perspective when revealed.  Sometimes it can be very different in perspective than what was actually intended from the private conversation.  Sometimes this needs corrected (if a player just misinterpretted the GM info)  but  other times it can be awesome fun and add to the story in ways the GM might not have thought.  <br/>For Example:<br/>In a recent game I had a major NPC show up to talk to a PC, being at the PC's home when he returned for the evening.  The PC's wife and young child were there, and this NPC was playing with his daughter... I hadn't intended it to BE a threat.  But the PC took this as a massive unspoken threat against his family.  In a way seeming like a massive innuendo intimidation from the NPC.  I didn't mean it to be that from the NPC, but it worked amazingly to inspire the Player to finally ACT turning against this villainous NPC that he'd been "dealing" with up until then (for 18 game sessions!).  The role-play he had back at the table in discussion with the other PCs was surprising and powerful when I finally saw what HE saw from that private interaction!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  Timid players... I see private conversations as perfect times to spotlight those timid players.  If they have the luxury of cowling to others at the table to make their decision for them they will... If they don't have that, many times they'll be able to shine when given info privately.  That then many times will roll-back into the table talk with the other players.  I look at it as positive.   If they're still acting like the deer in the headlights I use the time (each time) to help that player work through that shyness with me alone so it helps them get comfortable rather than putting them on the spot in front of others.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.  Lastly - I don't look at the private info as OMG type shocking revelations, though at times it has been.  I look at it as time individually a player can get the info then take it and represent it in-character from THEIR character's point of view.  They can choose to give whatever they want with the slant they want to give.  It's what people do naturally in real life.  If the player wants to show the personality of their character this is a great way to show it.  Alternatively they can choose to just GIVE the info as straight as possible.  It's still the PLAYER'S choice.  and that's less OMG and more empowering.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>I do something simular (email, one shots, private scenes) but I dont have make a secret of it, nor do I hide it, or its results.</blockquote>\n<br/>Yup... This is just an individual personal choice.  Transparency is the choice of the group to enjoy, either way.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/> I run trad and the idea of gm&lt;-&gt; player antagonism comes from that. Many of my players think that I seek out to kill them every session (I hope they think at least I stick to the rules) and they seem to enjoy the two way struggle. </blockquote>\n<br/><br/>I'm absolutely on the opposite side of this... I will not, have not, and do not WANT to be antagonistic as a GM.  My continual want is for the freakin' HEROES of OUR shared story to win win win!!  But my gamer friends, as players in games I GM,  KNOW that I'm going to use everything I can in the rules and stats and motivations of the NPCs and world to challenge and (in the end) inspire their characters and their stories.  In that way a seemingly impossible victory is even more exciting.  <br/><br/>But I can still enjoy losing (as GM) since I was ultimately routing for the main heroes of the story.<br/><br/>I come to the game as a referee and as a storyteller.  Not an opponent.  BUT when its the villain's turn I'm in their shoes!  I'm routing for "myself" as that villain but not as a GM.  Many times I'll have fun and antagonize the group a bit with little jabs and comments,  but I ONLY do this if I know it's coming across in a positive manner -  not in a negative confrontational way.  In that way I play the antagonist - but as more for the "rev'em up" antagonization that a gym-partner might do when training with a friend...  "COME'ON YOU P*!!$, YOU CAN'T GET ANOTHER Nat 20!!"<br/><br/>But in the end the game I love to play and run is one of shared story, where the player characters are the main characters.  And we can each (players and GM) step back and be an "audience" as well as our individual roles.<br/><br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>Our positions are not really that different, just probably that i've had several burns using some of the technicques you use, and dont think they are worth the payoff. That said I dont get immersion (even in larps I dont get that whole idea of being in someone elses state of mind or whatever you want to say, immersion is not even on the playing field as far as im concerned) which may also account for it.</blockquote>\n<br/>Well.... my position on techniques is that you have to stick with them through thick and thin for a long while to get the payoff.  If you see potential in a style or technique even massive failures in-game can't stop you from taking it and making it better next time.  I've had a few negative experiences from those things I mentioned.  But overall they're positive and add to the overall game.<br/><br/>Immersion is a buzz-word that's scary or not understood for the most part.  But in the end its just another way of saying that you're enjoying yourself with in-character style role-playing.  If you enjoy that... then great.  Do it.  If you don't, then don't do it.<br/>Its a game.  Have fun.  And if you like discussing the techniques and/or psychology of why you do things in your hobby  (as I obviously do)  then ENJOY that too.  If not, don't.<br/><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211826/#Comment_211826" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T23:50:09+00:00" title="June 11, 2009 11:50PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thread, I really like the detailed work that have been put into the posts.

In our AD&amp;D game, there's a fair amount of PvP tension and so the transparency is even lower.<br/><br/>In Story games, unless you've either got telepathic communication or a good understanding of each others interests and characters or an obvious plot arc, transparency is much higher so that everyone can operate at the plot level without treading on each other's toes.<br/><br/>I don't think transparency has much to do with immersion, which works for me under either regime.

For example, when I run D&amp;D, I don't ask what spells have been prepared and they don't tell, that way I can run the NPCs without letting my knowledge of the players' prep unconsciously influence me.  That's important, as we want a dangerous dice fall where they may atmosphere, and my ignorance means less chance of great choices being stymied so as to preserve some bullshit story and less chance of lousy choices being softballed.  So, the only real exception in our group is sometimes the players keep stuff from the GM, but PC secrets are usually only secrets from other PCs, that has a cost but it's a cost worth paying for us for the benefit of the shared cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211860/#Comment_211860" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T05:40:49+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  5:40AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Picking up on simjames' comment, if a player wanted something kept secret I'm sure that would be cool with everyone in our group, providing the result wasn't them hogging screen time dealing with it.

Victor was secretly Victoria - a veteran of the former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Battalion_of_Death" rel="nofollow">Women's Battalion of Death</a> who did indeed leave Russia after November 1917, and disguised herself as a man to get by. As a fairly immersive player, feeling like I had a secret was important to me, and it affected the choices I made in the game (being very careful about being alone with a male PC in certain situations). But it certainly took up no spotlight time (what, the GM is going to take me into the hall to describe my bathing habits?) or intruded on the fun of other players.<br/><br/>I understand the argument that other players would like to share these secrets OOC so that they can set up entertaining scenes and share enjoyment of the secret's existence. However, if I'm aiming for an immersive play experience, then I don't <i>get</i> that enjoyment out of secrets known OOC; either I'll abandon any goal of playing immersively (unsatisfactory in CoC, bt I don't mind so much in other games) or just play characters who are very open people who don't have secrets (this is not uncommon anyway).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212074/#Comment_212074" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T23:18:22+00:00" title="June 12, 2009 11:18PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2009 11:53AM by Leonard Balsera.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My guiding principle is basically that the purpose of a secret is to eventually be revealed - otherwise, it's a useless bit of information that doesn't have any real impact on play. It doesn't really make any sense to me if one of the characters is secretly an assassin for the Lords of the Dark or whatever, and the whole campaign goes by without anyone ever knowing. I guess there's some additional payoff for that one particular player, but that's pretty exclusionary and self-serving, and hence I find it a tad distasteful most of the time. My tastes here translate to other media as well - mysteries are cool, but after a long enough period where pursuing those mysteries only leads to more mysteries, I get annoyed.<br/><br/>So if the subject of secrets comes up, I basically tell the players that however they want to handle the transparency issue, they need to understand that the Big Reveal is inevitable - it will happen, because that's the reason why you have the secret in the first place. So then it's a matter of whether they want the transparency to frame scenes dramatically around the secret, or if they want things to be opaque so they can create a sense of surprise.<br/><br/>Different secrets also tend to get treated differently - character background stuff tends to be opaque more often than plot info or other incidental stuff that comes up in the session. So, the other players might not know that Suzy used to be an assassin for the Lords of the Dark and it might not become public for a long time, but if her player decides during the game that she has a crush on Tim and doesn't want to tell anyone, that'll probably be transparent OOC info so that everyone can use that to help feed the story.<br/><br/>Also, sometimes we do the Big Reveal in such a way that the information becomes transparent without it being ICly revealed to the other PCs. I'm personally rather fond of having the Big Reveal happen when an NPC who knows the secret talks privately (but the scene is run at the table, of course) with the PC about the secret. That gets you a little bit of the best of both worlds - the moment of surprise still happens, but then there's a period of time where the players can play around with framing scenes around it before their characters actually find out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212076/#Comment_212076" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T23:40:23+00:00" title="June 12, 2009 11:40PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>So if the subject of secrets comes up, I basically tell my players that however they want to handle the transparency issue, they need to understand that the Big Reveal is inevitable - it will happen, because that's the reason why you have the secret in the first place.</blockquote>What if the character dies before that can happen?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212126/#Comment_212126" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-13T11:52:19+00:00" title="June 13, 2009 11:52AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: simjames</cite>What if the character dies before that can happen?</blockquote>\nMost of the games I play regularly these days (PTA, Misery Bubblegum, Fate, IAWA, S7S, and as a common drift in other systems),  character death is reserved for when the player considers a conflict important enough to put the character's life up for grabs.

So there isn't really a "wrong" way to reveal Suzy's secret - there are only those ways that Suzy's player buys into, and the subsequent consequences will be ones that expand opportunities for play rather than limit them.<br/><br/>Obviously, no one's perfect, so there's the occasional chance of miscommunication and whatnot, but again, that's what talking it out is for. And obviously, there are some games where part of the fun is "killing" another character by revealing their secrets (I think of highly political games of Vampire: The Masquerade in this regard), but as long as those expectations get established up front, again, it's really a non-issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212412/#Comment_212412" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T14:13:42+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  2:13PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alex,<br/>\n  To answer your OP, I agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have never seen secrets used to advance the fun. And I have seen them used many times to spoil the fun for a subset of the group (if not the whole group).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Generally, the less people that know about a secret, the less fun it is. Because of the scope and breadth that RPGs cover, there is no way that the "coolness" of your secret idea will ever match up to the expectations of what other players can dream up once they know there is a secret out there. And all the little facts that tie secret together will be lost to the ages if the players don't know there is a secret out there.

I love "immersion' in the sense that I get a thrill imagining how I would react to my character's situation. And honestly, this sort of note passing, secret hallway conversation having group generally distracts me from what's happening with my character and pushes me towards what is happening in the hall (or between sessions when I am not around, etc.). Kevin, this is not an indictment, I am glad you are in a group where you are having fun. And maybe if there was a level of trust there, it might be interesting to have a little secret, on the sly action, but to me it seems like a distraction to healthy group play rather than special sauce to awesome group play.

How I (and anyone) describes the *things* that their group does or has fun doing sometimes just can't come across as sounding like you'd EVER want to do "that"...  but then again if you tried it you might like it.  That said - I also know that it might be impossible to replicate something I tell you I'm doing with my group WITHOUT experiencing HOW I'm implementing it.  The subtle things I do to help that thing to work may be lost in my description since it's just a part of my natural style of building that feature into games I run.  <br/><br/>I'm not in anyway suggesting I have *special* tricks and talents that others don't but their are many things that I just didn't (or don't) grasp the understanding of until I experience them firsthand.  And everyone's different in their approach and attentions.  I will also note that not EVERY game I want to play/run deserves, warrents or is made better with LESS transparency.  I tend to go with the style, flavor and general theme of the campaign and setting to know how much transparency to use in any game I'm in.  My recent game examples:<br/>-  Midnight D&amp;D campaign setting:  short description of the style I see in it is Paranoia and Fear.  Those things can benefit from LESS transparency.<br/>-  Iron Kingdoms D&amp;D campaign setting:  short description - Cold War secrecy.  Again LESS transparency.<br/>-  My Life with Master (Batman):  I ran this as a short-shot and we used about 50% transparency.<br/>-  Super Heroes:  generally of 4-color variety is great for HIGHER transparency.<br/><br/><br/>What I'd say is that I've found if a player (new to me and my styles) comes to the table willing to try and enjoy something *new* then it's easily possible that you could really enjoy the less transparency I'm talking about without it being distracting.  My players often talk about how much MORE involving it makes them feel in-character rather than feeling distracted.  <br/><br/>I'm not preaching to convert anyone, but it is important to me that folks "get" that one style or another's techniques for playing can work if presented properly.  I'd welcome anyone to try playing in one of these type games I run, and I'd guess that a good portion would enjoy it if you come to the table willing.  But I am completely surprised that I seem to be the ONLY person here that has tried and enjoys LESS transparency.  <br/><br/><br/>The biggest thing I would note in my style for using LESS transparency ... I am extremely conscious of each and every player at my table's involvement.  If I feel something's excluding any one player I do my best to shift gears.  So anytime anything (transparency techniques or not) take away from the fun of the game or if anything seems distracting I'll quash it.  I'll admit that GMing in this way takes ALOT of mentle acrobatics...  it takes a great GREAT deal of multi-tasking and consideration for each person.  I have to be thinking three steps ahead 100% of the time,  plus considering what the current player's turn is,  listening to their COOL role-playing in-character dialogue, while considering their actions,  while taking a wipe-board note from another player,  while mentioning who's turn (in initiative is next up),  while referencing a rule or planning to reference for my NPC's next action,  making sure the background music is cool for the scene,  etc... etc...<br/><br/>heheh... multi-tasking  (to me)  is part of the fun of GMing,  but it's definately not for everyone.  It can be stressful, but I enjoy it.  I'd like to hear more on that... Think I'll make a new thread for GM techniques and multi-tasking.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212442/#Comment_212442" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T15:33:00+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  3:33PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>My guiding principle is basically that the purpose of a secret is to eventually be revealed - otherwise, it's a useless bit of information that doesn't have any real impact on play.

But the idea that it is possible to play a character without leaving a huge part of your knowledge about them <i>unrevealed</i> seems counter-intuitive. It's my character -- I know all kinds of things about them! I spend all my game time thinking about them and their actions and motivations. Unless I am constantly externalizing all of that information and character background -- and what a fascinating gaming group that would be! -- it seems inevitable that I will be keeping many, many secrets from the playgroup.<br/><br/>It also seems really obvious that they will absolutely affect play, because they will affect how I play my character and how I play my character affects play. I don't think secrets need to become explicit to count as part of actual play, and characterizing them as "self-serving" seems to miss the point entirely. If I bring a richer conception of my character to the table -- for any reason, including private knowledge I have about their past and personality -- how can that not enrich everybody else's play? Do you need to know exactly what makes a PC's motivations complex to understand and appreciate that they have complex motivations?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212506/#Comment_212506" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T20:55:35+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  8:55PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2009 8:57PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>This seems strange to me -- perhaps it is just the idea that a 'secret' is a special piece of information, apart from "other things nobody happens to know about my character but me."</blockquote>\nIn my mind, the term "secret" carries a connotation that does, in fact, separate it from that other information. You don't know who my father is or how I was raised, but that isn't really a secret. I don't have any active desire or reason to keep that knowledge from you, and you knowing that doesn't really impact me one way or another.<br/><br/>Suppose I were a covert government operative. The details of what I did when I was working for the government would be a secret. If you knew, there are several ways that it could potentially impact our relationship, or bring complication and conflict into my life. That's the kind of information I'm specifically referring to, and in stories (and in most of the games I participate in, because we've got a fair bit of the story hippie in us), it's a pattern you see time and time again - the mysterious character with the dark past will inevitably face that past again, because drama is moved by conflict and complication. Otherwise, all you have is a pattern of strange behavior that never gets paid off.<br/><br/>So, yes, there's a lot of what you know about your character that other players will never find out. But very little of that has dramatic weight as public knowledge, so the main impact it'll have on play is how it informs your relationship with your character like you're suggesting. And yes, that can enrich play because it shows in your roleplay as a more nuanced personality. But even so, without the added context that comes from knowing at least some of those details, there's only so much anyone's going to be able to take from parts of your portrayal. <br/><br/>Continuing with our running example, let's suppose the whole campaign goes by and no one ever finds out Suzy was an assassin for the Lords of the Dark, and let's suppose they're thoroughly evil and opportunistic. So all we know about her from play is that she was reclusive, selective about her trust, fiercely dedicated to whatever she put her mind to, and loyal enough to her friends to sacrifice herself for them. Probably she was an entertaining character to be around. We still lose something significant there, because in light of her past, her self-sacrifice gains a whole different level of meaning. <br/><br/>That's a dramatic payoff, and one that only Suzy's player gets to enjoy if the secret doesn't ever come out. The shared story ends up being not as rich. That said, I do sometimes enjoy figuring that kind of stuff out about the other PCs and having it be opaque until it's revealed. I just have a limit after which trying to figure it out becomes more trouble than its worth - at that point, if it doesn't get revealed so I can do something else with the information, my enjoyment of that pursuit diminishes.<br/><br/>And keep in mind too, the Big Reveal doesn't necessarily even need to be an in-game event, though I prefer that it is. I've had campaigns where most of the important character secrets were just revealed at the end of the campaign's last session, when everyone was talking and winding down. The payoffs can still occur then, because you can look back on what was played and go, "Oh, wow! So, that was a pretty huge moment when she let herself die so we could get away. Cool!" My preference is to be able to act on the information in play, but, y'know, I'm not the only one at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212510/#Comment_212510" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T21:31:12+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  9:31PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2009 9:32PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>n my mind, the term "secret" carries a connotation that does, in fact, separate it from that other information.

But what constitutes learning it vs. guessing it vs. a Big Reveal, I don't know. <br/><br/>I guess there are a lot of people out there who were really upset that we never found out what "the deal" was with Shepherd Book in <i>Firefly</i>, for example -- personally I'm kind of relieved we never found out, and I certainly don't feel like Knowing The Secret would have necessarily made the character more interesting, or his decisions more compelling. It may have, it may not have, in many ways it was far, far more important that there <i>was</i> A Secret, and its specific content wasn't really that important. Maybe if the series went longer this dynamic would have changed, and the details would become important to the audience -- but from the very beginning the details were probably important to the actor and the writers.<br/><br/>Mostly the only reason I started in on all of this was the use of "self-serving" and similar language to describe what, to me, seemed like an inevitable consequence of playing a character complex enough to last more than a session. If we define a secret as any information important enough to the story that it should be included in the story... well okay, yes, it would be good to include that in the story -- but it seems to me that many secrets that are important to a character might not turn out to be important to the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212526/#Comment_212526" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T02:04:07+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  2:04AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>And keep in mind too, the Big Reveal doesn't necessarily even need to be an in-game event, though I prefer that it is.

A lot of television characters are created "outside in" - the writers start with the strongest visible traits of the character, and fill in the blanks as the needs of a particular plot or episode warrant it. Commander Riker from <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> didn't have black ops or secret missions in his background until the seventh season, and then someone made up the Pegasus mission and poof, that's part of his background now. It certainly wasn't created up front. <br/><br/>And it's also fairly common for sensitive plot info to be withheld from actors in a serial show, so there's no telling if Ron Glass knows to this day what Book's deal actually was. He doesn't need to know that to tell Malcolm that they're never going to talk about it in that one scene in the movie -  turns out he was right, after all.<br/><br/>This happens in a significant amount of gaming, too. In my current situation, it's more common for truly opaque secrets to actually be bits of blank character history for the player to develop in play.\n<blockquote>If we define a secret as any information important enough to the story that it should be included in the story... well okay, yes, it would be good to include that in the story -- but it seems to me that many secrets that are important to a character might not turn out to be important to the story.</blockquote>\nWell, keep in mind that a lot of the games I play frequently nowadays give character secrets a mechanical impact on the game also, like a SotC aspect. Those are transparent merely from the fact of being written on the character sheet. So, usually, when folks I play with choose to have opaque secrets, it's deliberately to set up a payoff of some kind later on or a signal of severe expectation clashes in the group that need to be talked about and resolved one way or another.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: simjames</cite>I certainly don't have a problem with that.

I tend to invent details of the character's life and experience that I have no interest seeing in play (early childhood, for example) but require to get into her head. It may be important for me to understand that Vivian hates her father as much as she has become like him, and lacked any mother figure since infancy... but that doesn't mean I want to see drama from early family life come up, especially if it would be illogical.<br/><br/>If character immersion isn't working for me in a game then I lose interest fast, and would rather GM a game instead.

See, as a GM for that game, I would need to know what details you wanted "on the table" for me to use as story material and which you didn't. And that's happened in a Fate game I ran recently, too - the player wanted to go even further than the phase work to make a background for the character, so there was a set of details for him that were up for grabs (tied to his aspects) and a set of details he just wanted to use himself for roleplay purposes. That game imploded spectacularly, but not because of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
