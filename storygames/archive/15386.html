There is a longer pdf that is more academic on the subject <a href="http://www.albinowalrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/s3195017_WillOwen_Exegesis.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Somewhere buried on my hard drive is a splat book I wrote up for this very thing. <br/><br/>A lot of this depends on what you need in your game. <br/><br/>Basically how I do it:<br/><b>Layer 1</b> <span style="color: #0000FF;">physical landscape</span> - includes description and hints at what lurk within the larger landscape<br/><b>Layer 2</b> <span style="color: #0000FF;">history of the place</span> - who inhabited it, clues to what happened here, how was the place used, how the place was shaped by Layer 1<br/><b>Layer 3</b> <span style="color: #0000FF;">right now</span> - who is here now, mood (from the previous layers and this current layer), what is happening right now, hints as to what will happen soon<br/><b>Layer 4</b> - this is the mark you and players leave on the world <br/><br/>There is a fifth layers as well. This is what the next group of people (gaming group) do with your place. Ideally they build off your Layers 1-4.<br/><br/>I can give a more concrete example if you would like if any of this is helpful.<br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349274/#Comment_349274" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T11:30:07+00:00" title="November 20, 2011 11:30AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Ara, please continue. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349277/#Comment_349277" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T11:56:15+00:00" title="November 20, 2011 11:56AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2011 11:57AM by Graham.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like using architecture.

Ask yourself "What do the characters do?" and then ask yourself "Where would be a good place for them to do that?" And then ask that a couple more times.<br/><br/>Like, if it's a fantasy game set in a single city and you want fighting to be a thing, throw in a gladiatorial arena, maybe a monster-infested sewers, a bad part of town full of cutthroats and criminals. If "Sail" is a skill in the system in question, throw in a river, have it lead out to sea, figure who works at the docks and what goes on out there. If romance is important, throw in a park or some gardens to stroll through, a temple where marriages can be sanctified, a palace where the Widowed Prince mourns his lost love, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349290/#Comment_349290" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T14:10:39+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  2:10PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I wanted the environment to tell a story but I didn't really know what the story should be nor was I attached to a particular outcome of the story. <br/><br/>So, the opening:<br/><br/><b>Layer 1</b> - High walled dead end canyon. The area surrounding is a series of mesas and canyon land. Semi-arid scrubland. Some paths are cut into the soft sandstone others are made of crushed pots and rocks. <br/><br/><b>Layer 2</b> - Is messy. From the outside there is a purposefully carved archway in the dead end of the canyon wall. The stone is not native to the area. This tomb was built to be in a remote place. <br/><br/><b>Layer 3</b> - Right now.... Snow covers the ground and crunches beneath your feet. There are tracks leading to and from the stone portal. In places the stone is stained red-purple. Twisted pine trees dot the landscape and the sun is setting early. A frozen stream gurgles next to you. <br/><br/><b>Layer 4</b> - B has her character walk up to the archway. She adds her foot prints to the snow.<br/><br/>Inside:<br/><br/><b>Layer 1</b> - Same as outside. The tomb is carved into this layer. The rock is a striped sandstone alternating red and white. <br/><br/><b>Layer 2</b> - This a smooth carved room. In the center is an offering pit. Daylight fills the room but beyond is bathed in darkness. <br/><br/><b>Layer 3</b> - Right now... There are blankets scattered around. On of them is stained red-brown. Remants of a fire, bloodied cloth, and food stuff is scattered about. It smells of occupation. Down the corridor are faint raspy sounds. <br/><br/><b>Layer 4</b> - Here B has her character poke around in the places disturbing the bedding and scavenging what materials she could. So anybody passing through here would see that this place has been piked over. Plus her muddy footprints.<br/><br/>This process repeated for each place. This is more of a micro scale use. I do the same thing for the larger landscape around the area.<br/><br/>Techniques - <br/>You could write out all the narratives in advance and then watch to see how the players fiddle with them in Layer 4. Sometimes I sketch it out in advance most of the time it develops in play.<br/><br/>In play I am not attached to what it all means. B decided that the camp she stumbled across was old so that's what it became. She also figured someone was hurt. So I added that in. Later on she found another archway with runes carved on it. She failed her roll to read them but that lead us to adding to Layer 2. The runes were from an older civilization which then modifies Layer 2.  <br/><br/>There is a back and forth process as both the GM and player ask questions of each other to further clarify the narrative and from that a story develops. <br/><br/>I am probably leaving a lot of things out so please ask any questions. <br/><br/>I can give an example of something more zoomed out, like a region.<br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349298/#Comment_349298" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T16:10:24+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  4:10PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2011 4:12PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not great at this, but I want to get better at it.  I've tried lots of different things, mostly sticking to things I think are fun to do.  I mean, I'm not a map wonk, so I don't really get into doing in-depth landscape/history prep for a location; I'm more comfortable sticking to a Hollywood Location Scout level of detail, where all I worry about is <i>What makes this place look interesting?</i> and <i>What scene can we set here?</i>  So given that, here's some stuff I've enjoyed:<br/><br/>- I try to put at least one memorable detail in a location, something that makes this office building or that warehouse or those twisty little passages different from other office buildings/warehouses/passages.  More than one is fine, but not more than three unless I have a really exceptionally good reason for it: mostly, I don't want to be describing the scene for too long, because I want to get to the fun part where the players start doing things and I get to react to them.<br/><br/>- If possible, I like to have at least one thing to say about what it's like to be in that location.  It's cold, it's windy, it smells like flowers, the fluorescent lights buzz quietly, the mud sucks at your shoes...something that I think a character might react to or comment on, so interested players have an easy point of entry for describing how their character interacts with the environment.  More than one is kind of wasteful -- if I think of two or more interesting things along those lines, I'll just bank the extras and use them somewhere else.<br/><br/>- If I think there will be action in that location, I take some time during the week to daydream about cool ways to use that location in an action scene, and make a little list of things I might have the NPCs do: swing on the chandelier, throw bottles from behind the bar, knock over the tourists, etc.., in case any of the players were just waiting for a hint that they can start messing with the scenery.<br/><br/>- When a location works -- I have fun describing it and the players seem to have an easy time interacting with it -- I make more careful notes than usual and try to go back to that location again later on.  Reincorporation is always awesome.<br/><br/>- If I can, making the location fit the type of scene we're about to do is fun.  Sad scenes in depressing locations, angry scenes in loud/volatile places, conspiratorial scenes in dark/secretive rooms.<br/><br/>- If I know a movie/TV or real-life reference that everyone at the table will get, I'll use it as shorthand to describe the layout of an area.  (Anything to keep me from having to draw a fucking map, really.)<br/><br/>- Sometimes I've gotten good results doing "establishing shots" of a location; like, the scene itself is going to take place in a museum lecture hall, but I'll start by describing the neighborhood around the museum and the trip from the parking structure up the main steps.  If the players pick up on some part of that and run with it (they refer to things outside the lecture hall, they move the action into one of those adjoining spaces, or whatever), then it was a good move on my part.<br/><br/>- If I get a sense that a player has a really strong idea of what a location looks like (her character's home, the diner where they all go for coffee, whatever), I back off on my own descriptions immediately.  There's usually not a good reason for me to mess with their vision, so I take cues from the player instead.  I might ask them to provide a detail or two ("Is this one of those places with a formica counter running down one side and red pleather booths along the other?"), but even that seems to be a bit intrusive.  If they're fully engaged in what their characters are doing and don't seem to be having any trouble referring to the environment around their characters, then I don't need to do anything at all.  The job has already been done: they've got everything they need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349301/#Comment_349301" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T16:23:06+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  4:23PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Other Worlds there's a system for describing places in the same terms as a supporting character, with abilities and flaws of its own. I find that this helps me to define what's really important about a place in a way that's also useful for play. The location's abilities can 'attack' the player characters (Wandering Robber Gangs, Lethal Death Traps), penalise them in certain kinds of conflicts (Crumbling Infrastructure, Pitch Black), or even be called on as additional bonuses (Site of Ancient Mystical Power, Perfect Ambush Site).<br/><br/>If I've not prepared a location in advance I will often open up this process to a group brainstorm - this obviously eliminates any element of surprise to these abilities, but in my experience it also makes the location itself much more evocative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349320/#Comment_349320" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T00:25:30+00:00" title="November 21, 2011 12:25AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ara,<br/><br/>I love your checklist and your examples.  What do you refer to when you draw a blank for one of those?  Like, let's say a physical description leaps to mind, but then nothing hits you for a history that'll really add to it. <br/><br/>That situation comes up for me a lot, and when it does, I turn to the game's setting.  Knowing where monsters come from and what they tend to do and look like, and what trappings and practices distinguish different human cultures, allows me to bust stuff out without thinking about it too hard.<br/><br/>I think I've had particular success at this in my own game because the environment is linked to the main happenings in the world.  Dark magic corrupts nature, human rituals purify it, sun/moon/elements good, stars bad, etc.  So I don't need to remember historical specifics from a long setting book, I just need to know a few principles governing various forces that are at work deforming the gameworld's environments.<br/><br/>Ry, do you have such principles to work with?  If not, would it be feasible to invent some?<br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349321/#Comment_349321" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T00:32:31+00:00" title="November 21, 2011 12:32AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Example.

I know what the geography is. It's a tweaked version of New Mexico so the cultural (includes all the cultures!!!) and natural (plants, animals, etc...) landscape follows as a consequence of that. <br/><br/><b>When I don't have a history in mind: </b><br/>I refer to my prep (big overall layers that are imprinted on the landscape)<br/>I ask the players questions or they ask me questions<br/>It develops from a failed roll, like the carved runes in the example above. So failed rolls add to our landscape errr.. layers. <br/><br/>*One thing to note is characters have these layers too. So they change as they interact with the environment as well.<br/><br/>So the overall burial place could be framed like this:<br/>Cold, remote, lifeless (Graham's stuff here) <br/>Layer 1 - Canyon lands, scrublands, etc..<br/>Layer 2 - Is the tomb complex built for burial and guarding the dead. This layer gets edited as we need to during play to bring it to life. We add to it during play. <br/>Layer 3 - so on....<br/><br/>Both on layer 2 and 3 roll on a random table is a perfectly valid player move.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Ry">@Ry</a> That table looks neat. I will try that out. One of the things I like about this is that the environmental clues evolve into something like Bangs. But usually don't evolve in a way that I expect. <br/><br/><br/>Hopefully I am communicating myself clearly here, if not throw heavy objects at me until I make sense <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349348/#Comment_349348" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T10:51:37+00:00" title="November 21, 2011 10:51AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry - totally.

So we are cruising along with the opening scene with the tracks in the snow and frozen blood splatters. B gets her character to the threshold of tomb complex and I ask Walton (really a young woman) why are you here. B took the environmental cues and explained to me that Walton is looking for her sister who was kidnapped by odd creatures. B then describes the scene in the bedroom with blood spatters. B tells me Walton's sister is mostly likely wounded and dying. That's how we got at the Bang through environmental cues.<br/><br/>   I am very explicit about what failed rolls mean for knowledge, discovery type stuff. This allows the other players to help author the world and at the same time this brings about changes in the character. In the case of the runes:<br/>B said I want Walton to read the runes<br/>Me: Ok, roll for it<br/>B crapped I failed the roll, I guess I can't read them<br/>Me: You can't read them but do you recognize them? <br/>B said Yes I do.<br/>Me: So they must be old? Maybe beyond the living memory of the people in your village?<br/>B: Yeah that sounds good<br/><br/>We are building the world up as we play but also building the rule system as we play. I kind of suck (read: not well practiced) at putting neat mechanics together to get at what I want out of a game. So what you are seeing is the start of something that is being built from a previous attempt that I didn't like.<br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349516/#Comment_349516" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-22T19:15:28+00:00" title="November 22, 2011  7:15PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't have much to add but wanted to say...<br/><br/>...threads like this are why I really enjoy Story Games!<br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349526/#Comment_349526" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T03:57:09+00:00" title="November 23, 2011  3:57AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2011 3:59AM by 3Jane.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tables of evocative words for two different areas:<br/><br/>DungeonWords: <a href="http://www.risusmonkey.com/2011/02/dungeonwords.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.risusmonkey.com/2011/02/dungeonwords.html</a><br/><br/>WilderWords:<a href="http://www.risusmonkey.com/2011/04/w-is-for-wilderwords.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.risusmonkey.com/2011/04/w-is-for-wilderwords.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349530/#Comment_349530" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-23T07:13:32+00:00" title="November 23, 2011  7:13AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, when I make places, particularly fantastic places, I want two things happening:<br/><br/>I want something crazy and beautiful and fantastical being tossed at the players but I also want something in the description that allows folks to relate.<br/><br/>"The city is made of corral, as if reefs were somehow cultivated into crooked buildings off of a giant turtle's back.

For wilderness areas, skipping around in Wikipedia's <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Landforms" rel="nofollow">Landforms</a> category is interesting for inspiration.  Any little tidbit you know about the forces that shape the earth makes it possible for you to take a couple of elements and put a spin on them - rainfall patterns, erosion, etc.<br/><br/>2. For random bits of color, I made this <a href="http://www.trilemma.com/bw/Color-Wheel-v2.gif" rel="nofollow">"color wheel"</a>. There's no wizardry or procedure to it; just pick an item from two or three rings and mash them together.  The "aspects of nature" and "areas of human activity" rings help me remember things I haven't described in a while (even in a city there are animals aplenty), while the "emotion" and "defined by" rings are good for putting a spin on things.  (A community somehow defined by warfare and animals, or by resistance to geology gives some interesting starting points.  Religious architecture somehow defined by a total embrace of growth.)<br/><br/>3. I try to keep the layout as simple - or at least as permissible - as possible. I find geometrically complicated environments bring up immersion-breaking sidebar discussions.  "Wait, why can't I see the balcony from near the fountain?"  "The top of the archway blocks it; the balcony is within the courtyard." etc.  These problems are for first-person shooters.<br/><br/>4. I have this idea that something for the players to do in each important location would help them be memorable, on the principle that role-playing games are about interaction.  I'm not talking about littering the gaming experience with pointless tangents, but giving players an easy way to emote how they're interacting with the scenery - a jostling crowd, a view, a lit hookah - helps players bring their characters into the scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352263/#Comment_352263" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T10:30:25+00:00" title="December 22, 2011 10:30AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to run Urban adventures and often my dreams will provide me with inspiration.
